            "answer_text": "The presumption here first is that we\u2019re talking about a new or professionally reconditioned mask and that the mask is a government-certified mask. If so, the answer is \u2026 Abso-Positively NOT, for a normal healthy person. Can some civilians do it wrong and have problems? Oh, heck yes. I saw some poor guy the other day that had worn one of those cheap papery things for so long, day after day after day that it was all skudgy and so wet with his breath vapor that it looked like he was trying to breathe underwater. Yes, under exercise or stress circumstances your body builds extra CO2 which tells your brain to breathe faster or deeper. So do it. Is that \u201cCO2 poisoning\u201d? Nope. That\u2019s your body doing its job. There are medical procedure tricks of intentionally giving a patient a percentage of CO2 \u2014 far higher than you\u2019ll ever get wearing a mask \u2014 when the doctors want to kick up breathing rates or depths. And while I\u2019m ranting, let\u2019s address those criminals publishing those YouTube videos about oxygen readings being dangerously low when wearing a mask. Think about it. You inhale. Your body removes a bit of the available oxygen. You exhale. Where does all of that exhalate go? A tiny bit never makes it out of the lungs; a little bit stays in your trachea and nasal passages; most of it goes \u201cout there.\u201d How big is the space between your nose and the inside of the mask? A tablespoon? Two tablespoons (in the case of those stupid pointy things coming from a country which shall remain nameless.)? Then you inhale. Yes, those two tablespoons, plus the stuff that never got out in the first place (because that\u2019s how your body works) are \u201crecycled\u201d along with a huge dose of new full-oxygen air. Proof? Do this. Put on a well-fitted mask and breathe in it for 15 minutes. Now shift your concentration to your nose and the sensation of air temperature. Exhale. Inhale. Notice how the inhale cycle almost instantly turns to cool air? That rush of \u201ccool\u201d is full-oxygen fresh air. (I guess in Phoenix, AZ, right now the sensation might be \u201cshockingly hotter air\u201d but that\u2019s not true for most of the world \u2026 yet.) I had better quit now. We don\u2019t want to tax my blood pressure. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as \u201cCO2 poisoning\u201d. Don\u2019t confuse with carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Excessive CO2 (10 percent or more) can lead to unconsciousness through asphyxiation because your oxygen is insufficient. The air you inhale is roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 0.04% CO2, and trace amounts of inert gases. Exhaled air is much the same except for oxygen now at about 17% and the CO2 around 4%. This still revives unconscious victims being given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In fact, elevated CO2 actually stimulates your breathing response (ever notice that when you hold your breath it doesn\u2019t cause unconsciousness, but stimulates you to breathe more urgently? -That\u2019s not the reduced oxygen, it\u2019s the increased CO2.) Some of the exhaled breath remains in your nasopharynx, your trachea and bronchi, and is inhaled along with the incoming breath of fresh air. When swimming with a snorkel, you have a little more of this expired air to breathe in with each breath each time, but that is balanced by the slightly deeper breaths each time. Wearing a surgical or N95 mask reduces the volume of expired air you need to re-breathe to much less than using a snorkel tube. It\u2019s about an extra mouthful, that\u2019s all. If you are a really shallow breather, you might be bothered what seems to be the \u2018warm\u2019 air in the mask, but if you breathe very slightly deeper each time, you\u2019ll get all the fresh air you need. Medical staff wear surgical masks for extended hours, and workers wear N95 respirators for a shift, all without becoming unconscious or experiencing difficulties.    ",

You see the government has stolen your mental autonomy but you have to be able to think in order to protect yourself from snake oil mongers and car salespeople among other things. My dad used to buy cheap everything because he was conditioned to budget money by my grandmother. Five garden sprinklers later I bought him an expensive one for Christmas. He still has it twenty years later. Now he buys expensive because he can judge when it's warranted. Thinking ability. You have to think about masks carefully then make a personal decision about wearing one. Don't let the government order you or let people guilt you. Nobody cares about you except you. Turn on your brain the way a house activates it's alarm system against fire and burglary. Leave it on and process what's happening around you. If you don't think a mask is sensible don't wear one. If marijuana makes you paranoid don't smoke it. If you like the red shoes but they are three hundred just buy them! ",

The brain is required by the systems of the body. The brain requires, oxygen mostly. Levels under 19.5 are defined as clinically dangerous. Low levels of oxygen is called hypoxia A mask does not allow for a person to breathe air, instead, one is breathing exhaled air, containing mostly hydrogen. This is insufficient for the body to achieve homeostasis. Dizzines, confusion, disorientation, blurred vision, palpitations. Prolonged use of masks does lead to thrombocytopenia and a whole host of disorders including toxic shock syndrome and permanent brain damage. To remove oxygen alone, causes major repercussions. Conversely, hyperbaric oxygen treatment sucessfully cures many diseases. A mandate is not a statute of law. It does not matter which country you are from, it is illegal to enforce the wearing of masks. Nobody can tell ANYONE they cannot breathe air. I still have no clinical evidence this virus exists, as it has yet to be isolated. This is something I could do in 10 minutes. I hope this helps you. All the very best. ",

If you need to walk the least, you will be panting soon. Just walking can be like hiking up a mountain. The better the mask\u2014N95 without a valve can be distressing to nearly all of us and that is most likely from CO2 build up. There is no reason to wear a mask outdoors in uncrowded conditions except to show loyalty to those sick with Covid. If you are in a crowd were distancing is about right but people are talking to each other, than take you mask out of your pocket and put it on is my suggestion. In other world, don\u2019t wear a mask while in your own car, your own house alone, etc. Take the mask off as much as possible, but use a good mask, multilayer cotton or surgical or an n95 or kn95 when you do wear one. No other options. ",

Masks are a political necessity , not a health necessity, unless you are a health professional, like a surgeon. Masks do protect the politician\u2019s job, they make it look like they are doing something. Masks , distancing, hand washings, lock downs are all of questionable values. It is just politics. never under estimate the political angle, even the virus respect them. If you look around, the virus are much more dangerous in US Democratic controlled areas, but not Republican areas. ",

You may be thinking of restricted breathing because your mask is improperly fit, perhaps sucked up against your nostrils so that there is only a little fabric that you are breathing through, and you cannot inhale much, and you are getting exhausted. Get a better mask. Why do people think masks are one-size-fits-all? Do we go to a shoe store and say \u201c\u2026 give me a pair of shoes \u2026\u201d and just take anything off the rack and go home? Get a mask with full airflow for your breathing volume. I like the fan-forced filtered-air masks, as illustrated, like airconditioning, my exhale is pushed out before my next inhale, and it's always fresh and cool. Keep comparison shopping, be a good consumer. And stop complaining about your shoes being too tight. . ",

Felt dizzy, shortness of breath, etc. They performed their task well, they extend their working hours when understaff. They worked closely with Covid-19 patients. All face mask are breathable. That's the first requirements aside from filtration. Wear your mask but when there is a chance for you to breath freely, do it. Few seconds won't kill you. Be wise. Just wash the washable after every use. Don't wear the soiled one, the microbes will make you sick not the question of breathability! ",
