            "answer_text": "Statistics is a dark art. It\u2019s not a true math in the sense that math is discovered and inherently right or wrong. Statistics have veracity, but are subject to error and interpretation. Statistics is a tool. 99% of statistics are made up on the spot just to prove a point. Science was initially considered an art\u2026 and to some of us, it still is. So in that sense, I would say that statistics is more of a science than a math\u2026 but for that matter history could be considered a science, as well as psychology, forensics, beer pong, semiotics or any other sort of study. Or not. Disciplines of study overlap all the time\u2026 ultimately they all add up to what it is that is understood and known by a person where they are unified and integrated into who that person is. A man could be defined by the words that he knows. Words are like divisions\u2026 the more you know the greater the clarity of your digital vision is\u2026 and the more accurate the whole picture becomes. So, the real answer is that sometimes a statistic is just a statistic. -Freud (paraphrased) ",

            "answer_text": "According to wiki: Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Mathematics (from Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 m\u00e1th\u0113ma, \"knowledge, study, learning\") is the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change. It has no generally accepted definition. And Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \"knowledge\") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. And now we have to obtain answer to a new question: Is Mathematics a science? ",
