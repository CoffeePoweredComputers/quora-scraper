            "answer_text": "I agree with the other answers. It is not just practical but useful! You can do a complementary combo, like sociology/psychology and applied math (statistics), or anything stem and English (you wouldn't believe how hard it is to find someone who can write an understandable design document, technical manual or patent!) You can make a good living as a Tech Writer, and I've had the exquisite pain of proofreading 2 patent applications in my career, so I can assure you that anything stem will complement a law degree. You can also do things that seem wildly incompatible. My oldest\u2019s first band director had a B.S. in marine biology and a master's in performance piano. (Combining architecture and physics of sound gets you acoustical engineering, art and computer science gets you animation, etc). And a minor in a foreign language makes any other degree more valuable. Of course I am biased; I was a double major in math and English that had a career in programming (mostly CAD), my programmer husband was a physics major who minored in computer applications back when programming was part of the library science degree, and my \u201cbut you promised me there would be no math\u201d sister the tech writer was an English major with a minor in foreign relations. Combine what you are interested in. It will either make you more valuable, or give you a backup career, and it will make your schedule in college more varied. And it will help you narrow down your college choice, as you will pick a place that has degrees in both fields. ! ",

            "answer_text": "That's kind of what I did and it really worked out. STEM is a people centered study just like nearly everything else. What I mean by that is even if you want to do something like conservation for example there will be a lot of perspectives to consider before any conclusions can be made. Even if your daily work routine will be only computers and math you'll have to be able to explain your work to investors, bosses and clients who don't understand these details. The humanities are a great complement to a STEM major for that reason. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s very practical. Science + communication is a good combo. A humanities minor can give context and depth to a STEM degree. Just, don\u2019t get a STEM degree because you think you have to, or it\u2019s a ticket to automatically getting a good job. STEM degrees are hard and if it\u2019s not what you want, they are not worth the burnout and stress. But if it is what you really want, science is awesome and amazing and totally worth it. Go for it! If you do it right, STEM + humanities can be an awesome combo! ",
