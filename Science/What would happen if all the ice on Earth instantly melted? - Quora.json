            "answer_text": "Nobody\u2019s mentioned it yet, but one detail remains that has yet to be answered: To melt ice, you need a lot of energy. It takes energy for particles to basically go from not moving much at all to flowing more freely, in the same it way it takes heat for a person to go from remaining curled under the blankets to getting out of bed and smacking his head against the door in frustration at getting up in the morning.  \u201cWake up, particles in ice cube!\u201d And when I say a lot, I mean A LOT. It takes around 3.33 * 10^5 Joules to melt one kilogram of ice. And I mention this because, since we\u2019re melting all the ice in the world, that means we\u2019re instantly liberating HUGE amounts of energy\u2026and that energy has to go somewhere. To see why I\u2019m asking this question, we need some values and some math. We first need the volume and density of ice, since that will give us the total mass of all the ice on Earth. And I think we can find, at least, some of these values. Antarctic ice sheet says that Antarctica holds around 30 million cubic km of ice. Greenland ice sheet - Wikipedia says that the Greenland Ice Sheet holds about 2.85 million cubic kilometers of ice. And while it was difficult to find the total amount of ice in glaciers around the world, I did decide to use this source (Calculating glacier ice volumes and sea level equivalents - AntarcticGlaciers.org) as a guide to calculate the amount of ice in the world, by basically doing proportions. And for glaciers, I got around 212 thousand cubic kilometers of ice. As for the Arctic ice caps, I have 20,000 cubic kilometers, according to this source (\"What if all the ice melts?\" Myths and realities). This gives us a total of 33,082,000 cubic kilometers of ice.  Imagine all of this instantly melting. One cubic kilometer is equal to 1*10^9 meters, so multiply all those values (individually) by 10^9 meters, and we get a total volume of approximately 3.3*10^16 m^3. The density of ice is around 916.7 kg/m^3. Mass is equal to the volume times the density of an object or substance (in formula terms, m=dV), so the answer is m=3.0*10^19 kg of water. To put into perspective, How much water is there on Earth, from the USGS Water Science School estimates that the total amount of water on Earth is around 1.386 BILLION cubic kilometers of water in the world. That converts to 1.386*10^18 m^3, giving us a mass of all the world\u2019s water (since the density of water is 1,000 kg/m^3) of around 1.386*10^21 kg. That means that the total amount of water in the form of ice is around 2.2%, so that\u2019s a literal drop in the bucket for water. Now you see why ocean experts fear climate change. Anyways, so now we have our masses. GOOD. That leads to the next equation. You see, as I said before, you need energy to melt ice. Lots of energy. Suppose that one kg of ice is at a temperature of -50*C (we\u2019ll assume that this ice is from one of the two largest ice caps in the world). We first need to \u201cwarm the ice\u201d by increasing its temperature. This is called the specific heat scenario. Since we need to heat it to 0*C to change the phase of the substance, we first need the formula for the heat of an object barring phase change: Q=mc(delta)T, where Q=thermal energy in Joules, m=mass of whatever, c is the specific heat (amount of energy required to heat up one kg of something by one degree C; in the case of ice, it\u2019s around 2,100 Joules/kg*C), and (delta)T is the change in temperature. For phase one, i.e. \u201cwarming up the ice,\u201d we use the formula to find that the change in energy is Q=105,000 Joules. For perspective, one kilogram of TNT releases around 4 million Joules (TNT equivalent - Wikipedia), so this stick of dynamite releases around 2% to 3% of the energy of a kg of TNT. Next, we need to convert the ice into water. Since this means changing from a solid to a liquid, we\u2019re gonna need a LOT more energy than in the first equation. This is because we\u2019re having to make the particles move out of place, which is hard to do. The formula for this is Q=mL(f), where m=mass and L(f) is the heat of fusion, the amount of heat required to melt something. The heat of fusion for ice is L(f)=3.33 * 10^5 Joules/kg, so the total amount of energy to melt this one kg of ice is Q=3.33*10^5 Joules. Finally, we need to heat up the now-melted water so that it stays as a liquid. I\u2019ll define that as T=5*C. So, we need to do the specific heat formula Q=mcT, where \u201cc\u201d is the specific heat of LIQUID water. That\u2019s around c=4,186 Joules/kg*C. That means that the amount of energy required is Q=20,930 Joules. Add up all the energies required to find the total energy required to change the temperature of water from -50*C to 5*C. And we get Q=4.59*10^5 Joules. That means that we need about 10% the energy required for one kg of TNT just to melt one kg of ice. Now imagine melting BILLIONS OF TONS of ice. Doing the math again (this time, with the total amount of ice in the world) yields spectacular results. We get a total energy of around Q=1.38 * 10^25 Joules of energy. To put into perspective, a 1-megaton nuclear bomb releases around E=4.184*10^15 Joules, so that means that the total amount of energy required to melt the ice equals 3.3 MILLION megatons of TNT. And since this energy comes from melting the ice \u201call at once,\u201d implying that this ice just suddenly turns into water, this is less than a nuclear explosion (and definitely less than just melting ice) and more like an asteroid hitting the planet Earth.  Pretty much what this process is now.  So, what\u2019s this got to do with anything? Well, it means everything. In general, energy has to go somewhere. That\u2019s why, for example, we have storms. They\u2019re disturbances in the atmosphere caused by massive energy imbalances, due to an imperfect planet. In the context of this scenario, much of the energy will go into the atmosphere as a massive heat blast and a shockwave. The sudden release of energy will heat up portions of the atmosphere in the same way that a nuclear bomb superheats the atmosphere around it (Effects of nuclear explosions - Wikipedia). And since the atmosphere cannot hold that energy in for long, it releases it as a massive shockwave. So, in any location where ice exists, instead, we\u2019re gonna have big shockwaves - blasts similar to those of a nuclear explosion - happening across the world, but definitely taking place in Antarctica and Greenland. The sudden melting of ice in these regions will create shockwaves so huge that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they smashed parts of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres to pieces. The blasts of heat and wind would knock down structures for hundreds, or even thousands of miles around, so these two areas, by themselves, likely kill millions.  Every building is gonna look like this. Ice located on the tops of mountains (or in glaciers) would also suddenly convert into a shockwave, and some of these mountains and glaciers are located near populated areas (like the Andes near Lima, or Mount Rainier near Seattle), and the shockwaves from those areas might wipe out those cities too, so millions more are going to die. Speaking of Mount Rainier, I just realized: A lot of volcanoes happen to have ice on them, so if this ice suddenly converts into energy, some of it\u2019s gonna go into the volcano, and what\u2019s to say that won\u2019t shake up the mantles beneath these volcanoes, kickstarting massive volcanic eruptions? So, for example, Seattle, on top of being blasted into the ground, might stare pyroclastic flows in the face. Cool. Great. Nice knowing you, Washington State. Speaking of volcanoes, as these massive sheets of ice convert into energy, some of that energy will go into the Earth\u2019s crust, perhaps causing massive tectonic disturbances the likes of which the world has never seen. So, imagine, fault lines and volcanic areas rupturing across the world. That means more cities, like Los Angeles and Tokyo, are going to be shaken to pieces or buried in lava. Not a good day to be a human.  \u201cOh gosh, it\u2019s \u2018San Andreas\u2019 all over again! AAAAAAAAAH!\u201d The same tectonic motions could also cause tsunamis of epic proportions. Many of the world\u2019s most dangerous fault lines lie underwater, so if they were to rupture, they could push up huge quantities of water, generating tsunamis the likes of which the world has never seen. Imagine San Francisco and New York shaken to pieces by a megaquake and then swept into the sea by a series of deadly tsunamis. That would suck. Speaking of tsunamis, this event would directly cause one too. Any water (from the ice caps) that didn\u2019t instantly turn to steam would suddenly be pulled down by gravity, and the waters of those areas would sweep into the oceans, carrying sediments with them. The combined forces of the water and sediments would displace enormous amounts of water, so any areas not cleansed by tsunamis beforehand might suddenly find a tidal wave, tens of feet tall, or even higher, sweeping across the globe, as though someone just sloshed the Earth\u2019s oceans around. (Tsunami Facts and Information)  Pretty much this scene, except it\u2019s hitting every major coastal city in the world. All of this would likely happen within the first few hours, if not the first few days, of such an event. It\u2019s estimated that around 40% to 80% of the world\u2019s population lives within 60 miles of a coastline. That means that, if it somehow happened today, we\u2019d lose nearly 4 BILLION people from the tsunamis alone. And that\u2019s ignoring earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. (How many people live near the ocean? and http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/es/papers/Coastal_Zone_Pop_Method.pdf) To make matters worse, since this tsunami occurred due to the melting of glaciers, it\u2019s not going to act like other tsunamis; instead, it will stay at a height of around 216 feet above current sea level, as that is the amount of water locked within all of Earth\u2019s ice. That means multiple locations, across the world, will be gone forever.  \u201cThat\u2019s a big mess to clean up. But don\u2019t worry, the ocean\u2019s got that covered. No literally, it does. It\u2019s gonna drown all this.\u201d Here\u2019s a link to show what the continents in this \u201cNew World\u201d would look like post-melt. What the World Would Look Like if All the Ice Melted And we\u2019re just getting started. Since this water is a huge amount of fresh water, it could cause a permanent disruption to the Earth\u2019s climate in a couple of ways: One, fresh water is less dense than sea water, so it might slow down oceanic currents around the world, jamming them and causing massive climate disturbances, which (combined with the volcanic eruptions and fires around the world) would generate massive shifts in weather patterns around the world. Basically, we could see changes in storm patterns. That could mean more storms, bigger and faster storms, storms in places we don\u2019t normally see them\u2026the possibilities are endless. Some evidence suggests that we\u2019re already seeing these effects (or at least, see them soon). (Shutdown of thermohaline circulation - Wikipedia and World Ocean Heartbeat Fading? \u2018Nasty\u2019 Signs North Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation is Weakening) The other factor is that, with more water covering the Earth\u2019s surface, it\u2019s possible that the fact that the surface area of the land has shrunk could actually enhance storm activity by itself. Basically, the smaller the continents, the bigger the ocean, the more powerful storms can become. Don\u2019t believe me? Take a look at the gas giants in the outer Solar System. They have storms that, proportionally, would cover continents on Earth, if not the entire planet. One potential hypothesis is that the reason these storms never die is that, since they don\u2019t have any landforms on them, they don\u2019t experience as much turbulence and are able to \u201cexpand\u201d, allowing them to grow in size. (NASA Probe Spies Giant Hurricane on Saturn, Jupiter's Great Red Spot may die within your lifetime, and this article - Extraterrestrial Hurricanes: Other Planets Have Huge Storms - just gives an idea of what these storms are like)  Basically, imagine Earth\u2019s version of the storms in this image. In short, the long-term consequences could be that this massive release in energy could result in megastorms popping up on Earth. And that\u2019s ignoring the possibility of more greenhouse gases thrown up into the atmosphere, which will make things worse. In short, Earth will be a total mess, and it\u2019s a mess that might result in a mass extinction level event. In other words, all complex life might die. And all because we dramatically melted all the ice in the world so quick. TL;DR: Everything dies.  Phew\u2026.That was fun, but let\u2019s get down to it for a second. This is, thank God, impossible. Not only do you need a lot of energy to melt even a small amount of ice, but to do it so quickly would require a process that would likely be able to destroy everything on its own, without using water as a weapon. That doesn\u2019t mean that this question was stupid. In fact, I actually thought this was a good question. Not only did it force me to recall concepts involving Thermodynamics, but it also taught me a few things about the Earth. Which is always nice. What it does mean, however, is that 1) this melting is unlikely, but 2) we should be careful about our planet. While not all of Earth\u2019s ice will melt within our lifetimes, even a small rise in sea levels might dramatically impact our way of life indirectly and directly. So we need to be careful about our future. Hope for the best, and prepare for the worst. ",

            "answer_text": "Lots of debate has happened on this topic. Lots of prediction (some no less than doomsday type) has already been. But, the weird thing is a large percentage of population still does not believe this as truth let alone push for avoiding it. Let me list down a chronological set of predictions that I believe The world sea level will rise by 70 meter viz. 230 feet. Keep in mind this will happen when \u2018all\u2019 ice in world melts. So, immediately this rise in sea level will cover lot of land mass that includes big cities like Mumbai, shanghai, new York, Jakarta, Miami, etc.The immediate reaction of this will be that 1.8 billion viz. 20% of human population will be displaced from these cities and we will have a global refugee crisis. They have to be moved into inland areas.These cities are some of the wealthiest areas of the world. Loss of these places will mean lot of lost investment globally. This will mean global economy will come down crushing.Since, polar ice on both ends of the earth acts as a prime actor in flow of sea currents around the world, their end would mean these current will change dramatically. The sea current will change and the direction it will move will be more extreme. The sea life would may not be able to evolve to this change. This will cause mass extinction of sea creatures as well as polar animals. This mass extinction will have deadly consequence on earth climate as well as human food supply.The sea plants which contribute to high percentage of oxygen will be highly affected just like sea animals. They might too die causing lack of available oxygen in air. This will cause reduction in oxygen percentage from air and rise of carbon dioxide in air. Affects of high altitude sickness may be seen in animals unable who are unable to acclimatize to this change.Change in sea current means change in land temperature. Those place that received more rain may not receive any more rain. Those that were desert previously may receive heavy rains. This means that global agriculture will be hit hard leading to low yields. This will cause global famine. This will lead to second global refugee crisis. This refugee crisis will affect much higher percentage of human population. Riots will be common in these areas. Local governments will topple. Rise of local warlords will be very common in areas hard hit and having less resources to distribute food. Global economy by this time will be taking a nose dive.Sun will be able to draw more vapor from ocean. This will make more clouds in the sky. These clouds like uneducated youth of a country will assemble near any mountains and will pour down causing massive deluge in those regions. This deluge will affect lots of properties and claim lot of lives.This deluge will not stop in the origin. This will come down as it reaches the ocean. All the big cities near the rivers will be flooded. Agriculture along river basin will be washed away leading to another set of food shortage.Any earthquake in the ocean or coastal region will be deadly as the resulting Tsunami will hit other nearby regions harder.Similarly, oceanic hurricanes will be more frequent and more powerful as more heat means they will carry more moisture. These hurricanes when they hit land will pour massively causing another flooding killing more people.Mostly areas will be cloudy and humid. Swamps will take most percentage of earth areas. Lots of land animals that are not used to such environment will also migrate. This will clash will incoming human population from coastal and flooded regions. Obviously, lot of wild animals will be killed by humans as a result of this interaction or will die leading to wild life reduction. Bees will die too that will greatly affect plant pollination. Global food production will take a nose dive leading to massive human population reduction.Temperature will be highly extreme in most places. Some places will be extremely hot some will be extremely cold. Some places will see regular flooding some will be mostly humid. Lot of places will have dry and wet seasons. Human cultures not used this to will fade away.All this will cause massive movement in population. The countries greatly affected will have its citizens migrating to better countries viz. ones less affected. This will cause global immigration crisis. This will cause clash in migrant population and local pollution who themselves are struggling with changing environment. This will lead to massive riots and property destruction. Rise of warlords means that the conflicts will take a deadly turn. Even for a united large country there will be lots of internal conflict due to this change. Secession movement will accelerate among those regions.All this will cause massive change in current global structure. This will show how delicate our current system. This will crush that structure. The population to sustain the current economy will no more exist and economy will experience long term worst recession.I think this is already a nightmare picture of world. There will be still more dangerous after effects. But, their occurrence to me is less probable than the ones I have mentioned. One can be rise of ice age viz. reversal of the global heating affects. This again will cause loss of life. But, with such a colossal loss of life may mean this change may not be that dramatic. Anyways this was my two cents to this ongoing debate. ",
