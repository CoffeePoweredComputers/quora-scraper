            "answer_text": "As an economist I would say, about as scientific as one needs the discipline to be. It depends on what the ultimate destination of the result will be - sometimes you can ballpark it and that's enough. But when it comes to other matters, politics enters the picture and taints the science with subjectivity. Cost-benefit analysis - valuation of things that come down to vote weights, for example  - I place more in Accounting Pure research Economics more often has scientific attributes. What are people going to do with the answer?: that's usability. Of course there are a lot of people who do Economics for theoretical background and argument mainly, and that's great - theory is the backbone.  But IMHO it's necessary to show and to prove the theory with numbers. By \"scientific\" I mean an often unstated requirement to be empirical, using data. The need for results often objective, descriptive, whether preference-related, normative, prescriptive, can involve a number of fields: math, statistics, demography, sociology, cultural anthropology. Data representation for these disparate and often conflicting variables requires careful design of experiments. This design: capturing/gathering the proper data, statement of the null hypothesis, choice of distribution, testing, finding, is science to me. (The distribution model I have in mind is given.) A finding can be based on collation of subjective opinion. It can be a meta-analysis, where you summarize separate studies to indicate majority trend. You can digest expert interviews. You can even collect answers from focus groups. All of those CAN be scientific if only done very carefully, with an outlook toward the variance (the mean is not really a statistic for repeated measures - and we want to see the error to see where we're messing up - it's a QUALITY thing.) If the method is careful, then with complete honesty and transparency, we can accept or reject the null, as in a laboratory. We can make inferences, interpret, contextualize, etc., given numeric outcomes. That's real science. My personal career has been an effort to debunk what people say certain aggregates mean, these aggregates having been accounted for the purpose of usability, and called Economic statistics. There are a number of characteristics related to estimators that a finding should be compared to, in order to validate (sometimes verify) its truth and usability. I have been lenient about accepting statistics that do not require as their main focus accuracy and precision. There's also consistency, validity, timeliness, a number of others. If you're only going for consistency, then fine, but a monkey can do that. And mere consistency does not impart much information about how to measure better, to be \"more scientific.\"  ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no scientific field is scientific in the sense that institutional provisions for science are serving personal delusions or predilections rather than in service or custodians of objectivity. Why? Most science is performed by government agencies that need to reconcile the fact that they are exponents of objectivity, and yet their recourse for money is the extortive state Most private and public institutions serving science function as \"schools of thought\", who are more interested in preserving their beliefs than shattering them by attempting to reconcile them with other's beliefs. This is true of all science but particularly the humanities because they are more complex open systems where testing hypotheses is harder because of the richer context of variables. Any knowledge depends on assumptions. The modern education system is highly compartmentalised, so exponents of any idea rest on assumptions that they take for granted. Given the systemic flaws of state sanction and entrenched religious/mystical beliefs (concealed by political correctness), there is very little honesty in science. Money is a corruption of science for people with no respect for objectivity.Science thinks empirically or analytically; it cannot bring itself to be both because of those entrenched assumptions. It therefore ends up being condemned to be the leap of faith that the mystics always wanted. Meanwhile the assumptions go unchallenged because the ultimate mystics, politicians, like to selectively engage their \"scientific corp\" at their discretion, when they need its legitimacy. So science becomes in any realm related to politics, the instrument of politics, but also now, the driver of it. The media plays a big role giving science a profile here. I read today that rodents have empathy. Surprised? Why do you suppose the media would like to project that truth? Anthropogenic-driven climate warming? Gay genes? Psychotic genes? Selfish genes? You are either 100% responsible or you are not responsible at all. Why? Collective sanction. Why? Watch those assumptions.",
