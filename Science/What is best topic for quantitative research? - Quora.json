            "answer_text": "In general any research project that attempts to make a reliable prediction about a phenomenon will tend to be quantitative in nature. The trick, however, is that your terms will need to be specific in a way that they can be conceptualized using numeric data. For example: Does the introduction of a particular chemical into a frog pond increase the body weight of frogs?Do push-ups help improve well-being?Are men on average more responsive to beer ads than women?The distinction between quantitative and qualitative research is blurring somewhat in the age of computational data analysis, however. For example, social network analysis uses fairly complex quantitative analysis to describe the structure of the relations among groups of people. Often the results of this kind of analysis is more favorable to case-related analyses than traditional quantitative analysis, even though quantitative data are applied throughout. Beyond that, there are a number of key things that scream \u201cquantitative\u201d in a research paper. Considerable detail in defining terms.References to models used for previous research.An overall argument that follows something like \u201cwe expected x to happen based on all our readings, and we discovered that \u2026\u201dA tendency to focus on sampling procedures and the justifications for using them.Tables and graphs.Null and Alternative hypotheses, with the former usually stated in the negative (\u201cmen are not more responsive to beer ads than women\u201d) and the latter trying to refute it.Formal headings and an extensive methodology section.Hope this helps!
