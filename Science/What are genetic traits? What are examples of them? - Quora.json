            "answer_text": "Traits are controlled by genes that pass from parent to child. Such inherited traits are called genetic traits.Others are acquired through learning. But most are influenced by a combination of genes and environmental factors. Below are some examples of variable traits that are easy to observe.  Earlobe attachment If earlobes hang free, they are detached. If they connect directly to the sides of the head, they are attached. Earlobe attachment is a continuous trait: while most earlobes can be neatly categorized as attached or unattached, some are in-between.Although some sources say that this trait is controlled by a single gene, with unattached earlobes being dominant over attached earlobes, no published studies support this view. Earlobe attachment and shape are inherited, but it is likely that many genes contribute to this trait. As such, its pattern of inheritance is difficult to predict.  \u200b  Tongue Rolling Some people can curl up the sides of their tongue to form a tube shape. In 1940, Alfred Sturtevant observed that about 70% of people of European ancestry could roll their tongues and the remaining 30% could not.Many sources state that tongue rolling is controlled by a single gene. However, as Sturtevant observed, people can learn to roll their tongue as they get older, suggesting that environmental factors\u2014not just genes\u2014influence the trait. Consistent with this view, just 70% of identical twins share the trait (if tongue rolling were influenced only by genes, then 100% of identical traits would share the trait).  \u200b  Dimples Dimples are small, natural indentations on the cheeks. They can appear on one or both sides, and they often change with age. Some people are born with dimples that disappear when they\u2019re adults; others develop dimples later in childhood.Dimples are highly heritable, meaning that people who have dimples tend to have children with dimples\u2014but not always. Because their inheritance isn't completely predictable, dimples are considered an \u201cirregular\u201d dominant trait. Having dimples is probably controlled mainly by one gene but also influenced by other genes.  \u200b  Handedness Handedness describes our preference for using either our left or right hand for activities such as writing and throwing a ball. Overall, about 10% of people are left-handed, but the number varies among cultures from 0.5% to 24%.Some have reported that handedness is controlled by just one or two genes, but this is not the case. Multiple studies present evidence that handedness is controlled by many genes\u2014at least 30 and as many as 100\u2014each with a small effect; many are linked to brain development. Environment also plays an important role: some cultures actively discourage left-handedness.  \u200b  Freckles Freckles are small, concentrated spots of a skin pigment called melanin. Most fair-skinned, red-haired people have them.Freckles are controlled primarily by the MC1R gene. Freckles show a dominant inheritance pattern: parents who have freckles tend to have children with freckles.Variations, also called alleles, of MC1R control freckle number. Other genes and the environment influence freckle size, color, and pattern. For example, sun exposure can temporarily cause more freckles to appear.  \u200b  Curly hair Round hair follicles make straight hair, flattened or c-shaped hair follicles make curly hair, and oval hair follicles make wavy hair. Hair texture is a continuous trait, meaning that hair can be straight or curly or anywhere in between.Curly hair is influenced by genes much more than by the environment. While curly hair runs in families\u2014people with curly hair tend to have children with curly hair\u2014its inheritance patterns are often unpredictable.Multiple genes control hair texture, and different variations in these genes are found in different populations. For instance, curly hair is common in African populations, rare in Asian populations, and in-between in Europeans. Straight hair in Asians is mostly caused by variations in two genes\u2014different genes from the ones that influence hair texture in Europeans. And different genetic variations make hair curly in African and European populations.  \u200b ",

            "answer_text": "A \u201cgenetic trait\u201d is a trait that is carried in the DNA of the subject. For example\u2026 type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1) is a genetic trait. BUT\u2026 carrying a genetic \u201cmarker\u201d for a trait does NOT mean it WILL manifest - it means it MAY manifest. In the case of T1, while the genetic marker for the disease must be present for the disease to manifest, it does NOT mean it WILL manifest\u2026 we know that an environmental \u201ctrigger\u201d is required for that to happen. In the case of a genetic trait that tends to manifest in successive generations - like T2 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus), the trait is not only genetic, it is also hereditary. Most folks don\u2019t understand that difference, and use the terms interchangeably - but they are different things, with different meanings. There are many genetic traits\u2026 hair colour, eye colour, skin colour, and so on; most of those are hereditary, and that\u2019s the more commonly cited type of genetic trait. But a trait can be carried in the genetic code - but never manifest in the individual carrying it - but still be passed on to an offspring, in whom it also may or may not manifest. Most genetic traits are NOT simple, one-gene conditions\u2026 multiple genetic markers are often involved for a trait to manifest. In the case of some (like T2), it\u2019s not only several markers\u2026 but the order in which they are arranged on the chromosome that determines whether or not the trait manifests.
