            "answer_text": "Any change in its momentum is matched by an exactly opposite change in the momentum of the other object. If only two objects are involved, the second objects initially had zero momentum in the frame of reference being used, and the first object comes to a stop, the second object ends up with all the momentum the first object had. Momentum seems to be a strictly conserved quantity. Nothing can produce a net change in momentum in the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "Momentum during any collision is the same as it was before the collision and the same as it will be after the collision. Only an external force can change the momentum. A totally elastic collision will also have the same kinetic energy before and after the collision, but DURING the collision some kinetic energy will be stored as elastic (potential) energy which will be released to yield the \u2018correct\u2019 final kinetic energy.
