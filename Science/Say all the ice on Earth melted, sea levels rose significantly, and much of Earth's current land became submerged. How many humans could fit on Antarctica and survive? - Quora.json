            "answer_text": "If you argue that the East Antarctic area is the place to put these people, and you place them at a density of about 200 per sq. km. (which is common in parts of Europe and Asia, but not hugely crowded), then you can fit about 2 billion people there. Downside is that there is no soil, no agriculture, very little freshwater, and no infrastructure to get food to them. So it would be hugely expensive to get them all the materials they need, especially energy, as it will still be cold! Far better to move people inland ahead of sea level rise and other unpleasant effects, such as storm surges, and let them be close to existing agriculture. Fortunately Antarctica is losing very little ice from East Antarctica, most of it is coming from West Antarctica, and Greenland appears to be losing more. So the biggest sea level effect may not happen. But what\u2019s melting in Greenland is a serious problem. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several incorrect premises here. First of all, according to the National Geographic Society, the sea levels would rise 216 feet. This would submerge countless seacoast cities BUT the higher areas of the continents would still be above sea level. Sorry, no world-wide flood that submerges all of the land. If you want a look at it , go to youtube and look up \u201c How Earth Would Look If All The Ice Melted\u201d by Science Insider.\u201d All of the seven continents would still be there, but smaller. With lots of survivors. There would be major changes to society AND humanity as a whole, but there would still be human beings on all of the major continents. The second part is Antartica. Antartica is a frozen ice-covered continent\u2026 Humanity could not exist there unless they use todays technology. Yes I know about the animals that thrive there, AND about the Greenland Eskimos, but they are all small populations. Dump several thousand people unprepared in Antartica and they will overwhelm the severely limited resources available and they will all freeze to death. A group of several million would all wind up as frozen corpses. None would survive. Everybody Dies. ",
