            "answer_text": "The question was \u201cCAN giant squid or colossal squid hunt Blue Whales\u201d but, before addressing that, the real question should be \u201cdo they\u201d and the answer is \u201clikely not\u201d. Blue Whales generally hunt within 100 meters (330\u2032) of the surface, following the krill, which live, for the most part in the upper levels of the ocean. The \u201cgiant squid\u201d and \u201ccolossal squid\u201d generally live - and hunt - in the region of 1,000 to 2,000 meters. Sperm Whales and Pilot Whales descend to those depths (in the case of Sperm Whales, even deeper) in their own hunt for squid, but not Blue Whales or their close relatives (Sei\u2019s, Bryde\u2019s, Fin, etc.). BTW, it should be noted that there is less size difference between a \u201cgiant squid\u201d and a \u201ccolossal squid\u201d than the names suggest. The \u201cgiant squid\u201d is actually longer (esp. its tentacles) than the \u201ccolossal squid\u201d. The \u201ccollosal squid has a rather larger \u201cmantle\u201d (basically the \u201cnon-tentacle parts\u201d) than the \u201cgiant squid\u201d, as well as larger eyes and a much larger and more robust beak. Even so in term of overall size and weight, they are \u201cpipsqueaks\u201d compared to a Blue Whale, with \u201ccolossal squid\u201d getting to maybe 46\u2032 long (vs. 85 to 110\u2032 for a Blue whale - and much of the squid\u2019s length is tentacles, not body, like the Blue Whale). They can also reach a weight of, maybe, 1,650 lbs., which is about what a Blue Whale\u2019s tongue weighs. SO, \u201ccould they hunt them\u201d? Eh, anything\u2019s possible. BUT, like your dog when it catches up to the delivery truck its been chasing, there\u2019s a real question what to do with your catch and a \u201cgiant squid\u201d or \u201ccolossal squid\u201d grabbing onto a Blue Whale is gonna have about as much fun as your dog with its teeth stuck in the rear wheel of an 18 wheeler barreling down the highway at 60 mph.

            "answer_text": "The giant or colossal squid can hunt the blue whale but it is not likely to find one. This is because the giant squid mostly exists in deep water between 1,000 and 3,000 feet down. The blue whale generally feeds on krill (their main food) down to only about 300 feet during the day, and near the surface at night (where krill migrate up to in the dark to feed without being seen). Even if a colossal squid were to encounter a blue whale, it is not likely to be a threat to the whale because even the largest squid is only about 50 feet long including the tentacles, while the blue whale can reach about 100 feet long. More importantly, blue whales can weigh up to 200 tons. That is a lot more than even the biggest, hungriest colossal squid would want to take on. ",

            "answer_text": "Colossal Squid, very doubtful. Giant Squid is very likely. Blue Whales are known to dive into the range depth of Giant Squids. However, most of them would kill the juveniles since they seem to be easier to take down. But we aren\u2019t down yet. The largest mantle measured 2.74 feet long, the size ranges from 5 meters to 27 meters. In fact, it\u2019s likely some were too long and too big to fit inside the mouth of a Sperm Whale. If we are talking about a 27 meter long Giant Squid hunting a Blue Whale then yeah possible, although the Blue Whale will likely make it out alive but seriously injured. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The biggest colossal squid are thought to reach up to about 750kg; giant squid are smaller. In comparison, an adult blue whale can weigh more than 100 tons, and even at birth weighs almost three tons. Also, giant and colossal squids have blood in which the oxygen is carried by haemocyanin in solution, which is considerably less efficient than the haemoglobin in corpuscles that whales have, and their muscular tissues are saturated with ammonia to aid buoyancy, so they aren\u2019t capable of the sustained levels of activity that whales can muster.
