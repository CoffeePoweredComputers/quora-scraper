            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cCan a cellulose filter paper be powdered?\u201d Yes, a cellulose filter paper can be powdered through mechanical (e.g., milling) and/or chemical means. First step is characterization of the paper to identify qualitatively and quantitatively the contents. Then, based on the results of analyses, the main process of powdering is designed. Because cellulose if highly crystalline with strong highly ordered microstructure, the whole process is not that easy. Thanks Patricia for request to answer. ~ SD ",
