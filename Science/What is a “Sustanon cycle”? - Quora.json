Base Sustanon 250 Cycle: A base Sustanon 250 cycle is a perfect plan for a beginner, but can also be used with high success by many veterans. A base Sustanon 250 cycle will be very simple, but it will also be highly effective. More importantly, this plan will be well-tolerated by most healthy adult men and should produce results each and every time it\u2019s implemented. With a base plan, it will be the individual\u2019s diet that determines the final outcome. This plan can be used for bulking or cutting and with equal success. Many will find it will only contain Sustanon 250, but in most all cases will need an anti-estrogen. While Sustanon 250 may be the only steroid in the plan, some may find it beneficial to add Dianabol during a bulking phase or Anavar during a cutting phase. With that in mind, below we have laid out the base Sustanon 250 cycle. There are two plans, one containing Anavar and one containing Dianabol. If Anavar or Dianabol are not desired, simply follow the rest of the plan. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the most misunderstood ideals when it comes to Sustanon is how to properly use it in a cycle. There is no wrong way, but there is a best way to administer proper doseages so you can fully benifit from the esters in Sustanon. Sustanon was developed for the primary reason of hormone replacement, and because of the mix of esters most patients only needed one shot a month to keep their hormone levels balanced. Because of this design, the bodybuilder will not recieve proper doseages at once or twice a week injections. Your blood levels will fluctuate up and down continually, which is not what you want while on a cycle. You want stable levels to give your body the best chance it can have to build plenty of muscle. All test is the same, but once only the ester is removed. People that say test is test are wrong unless you are assuming that the ester has already been removed. I have had plenty of different results fromt the different tests I have used, as well as I am sure you have too. The secret to making sus work correctly, is timing the esters so the blood levels do not fluctuate. Sustanon 250mg I will assume that everyone knows how an ester works and why one is added to the parent testosterone. With sustanon, you have 4 esters: 30mg of prop 60mg of phenylprop 60mg of isocaproate 100mg of deconate Combined to give you 250mg. Now everyone knows for themselves how much test they should take due to previous cycles or no cycles at all. Lets take each ester and see how long they will stay active in the body. 30mg of prop--Prop needs to be injected at least every other day to get the full benifits of the test. ",
