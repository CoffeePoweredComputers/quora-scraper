            "answer_text": "You need some training; you need to see a variety of successful teachers at their craft. Early in my training I read John Holt\u2019s book How Children Fail. I think for me it was enlightening and perhaps because it made me think or try to think from a child\u2019s view. In fact, my second hubby, when asked what his wife taught answers \u2018children\u2019 rather than Maths or Computing and in many ways I think that is the key. Yes, you are imparting knowledge but you are doing so much more than that. You are an example, you hope to light an enthusiasm for learning that will carry your pupils throughout their lives. ",

Reach out to them is a special way.Even though you may have to use terms unfamiliar to them, explain everything in simple terms.Ask for their comments and input on topics being taught.Make it clear what they are accountable for on a test.",
