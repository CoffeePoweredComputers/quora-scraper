            "answer_text": "Frying is generally performed in liquid fat (oil or some other molten fat). Typical characteristics of the frying process are rapid heat transfer, high temperature and Maillard reaction. There is some interest in use of alternative methods to achieve the same results, as in glucose frying (see this Page on wiley.com for an article on this), but it has yet to find its way in home, restaurant or industrial cooking. Regarding the second part of your question, it all depends on the temperature that is better suited to the food you are frying (is it already cooked , just needing an external crust, or not ? Is it meat, fish or vegetable? Is it sweet or savory? ) and the results you are trying to achieve in terms of taste, texture, healthiness. Generally speaking, you will want to avoid frying at a temperature higher of the smoke point of the fat you are using, as it will create carcinogenic compounds. Also, if you want to use butter, it is better to use clarified butter (or ghee) to avoid the acrid taste of the burnt casein. ",
