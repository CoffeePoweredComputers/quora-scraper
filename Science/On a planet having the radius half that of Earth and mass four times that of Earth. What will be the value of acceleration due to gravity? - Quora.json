We get, Acceleration due to gravity of required planet, g'=(G4M)/(R/2)^2 =4(4GM)/(R)^2 =16 {(GM)/R^2} g'=16g i.e. Acceleration due to gravity of required planet=16 times acceleration due to gravity of earth Acceleration due to gravity of required planet=16*9. 81 m/s^2 Acceleration due to gravity of required planet=156.96 m/s^2 ",

            "answer_text": "For Earth as we know it, the force of gravitational attraction between you and the Earth is given by (1) [math]F = G \\dfrac{m_E m_p}{r^2}[/math] , where [math]m_E[/math] is the mass of the Earth, [math]m_p[/math] is the mass of a person, [math]r[/math] is the radius of the Earth, and [math]G[/math] is the universal gravitational constant. By Newton\u2019s second law, we can set (1) equal to mass (of a person) times acceleration, which in this case is [math]g[/math], the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth. (2) [math]G \\dfrac{m_E m_p}{r^2} = m_p g[/math] Solving for [math]g[/math] gives (3) [math]g = G \\dfrac{m_E}{r^2}[/math] Now consider a planet with half the radius and four times the mass of Earth: (4) [math]F_2 = G \\dfrac{4 m_E m_p}{(\\dfrac{r}{2})^2} = m_p a_2[/math] Solving for [math]a_2[/math] gives (5) [math]a_2 = 16 G \\dfrac{m_E}{r^2} = 16 g[/math] So the half-Earth-radius, quadruple-Earth-mass planet has an acceleration due to gravity, at its surface, 16 times that of regular Earth.
