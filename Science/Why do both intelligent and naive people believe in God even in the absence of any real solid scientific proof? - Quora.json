            "answer_text": "In both the group, you will find people who are intelligent and naive. In fact both the group (non-believers and religions having a limited view, struck in creation) are only partially right. We are in fact swimming in the unlimited ocean of infinity which is all around us. If we get the implied truth behind the word infinity, our perspective will become even sharper: We are like an orphan boy who happened to be wandering in a forest without really knowing he is a prince, heir to the throne. Imagine the change of his perspective when he is told by the Prime Minister of the King that he was lost somehow but found now to be taken back to the Kingdom to be crowned as the future King. Similarly, we are conditioned to think in terms of limitedness as we perceive ourselves as body which has a beginning and an end; hence we are used to think in terms of a beginning and end. But we are in truth \u201ceternal.\u201d (Bible, Ecclesiastes 3:11); hence should not think in terms of a beginning and an end to anything. No matter one may say universe is too big that its diameter would be trillions and trillions and trillions \u2026\u2026 of light years. Even then in comparison to the unlimited space available in all direction, such a big universe will still be a tiny spot. So is the case if we assume a beginning for the history. If one says history began with Big Bang over 13.8 billion years ago, in comparison with the infinity that lies before it, even this history of 13.8 billion years would be like a tiny moment. If universe had a beginning it would mean there was nothingness before that supposed beginning. And if nothingness was there, then that nothingness would only continue forever as nothingness with no possibility for anything to emerge from it. That means universe had always existed as implied in E=MC2, and God never had a need to start a creation. That means His role is to renew the provisions for life\u2019s sustenance and enjoyment whenever they are depleted/destroyed by human need. If one assumes that God created us at one point, the unpleasant question would arise: \u201cWhat was God doing alone for all eternity?\u201d Just like nothingness was not possible, for God too to remain idle for all eternity is not possible. This is where the Indian concept becomes relevant. When everything is eternal, there cannot be any purpose for life. In India, perception of life is very simple, as leela (play). Just like children coming out to play in the ground, souls descend from heaven at various timings and go back all together at the end of each cycle of history called Kalpa. Children who CHOOSE to take this play too seriously make life (own and of others) a hell whereas others enjoy the life leading a relaxed life, and those with mixed qualities would reap accordingly. [Duration of each Kalpa is around 5000 years. We find population growing 5 times in 150 years; but even if we assume population grows only 2 times in 150 years, present population would be reached from two people in less than 5000 years: When you divide present population by 2 for 32 times, you reach two people, and 150 years x 33 = 4950 years]. At the end of each Kalpa, all souls return to God together as the earth has become uninhabitable due to pollution-related natural calamities, civil wars and nuclear wars \u2026. Then there is the need for renewal on earth. When God recreates the provisions for life\u2019s sustenance and enjoyment and thus Golden Age begins again, souls would start descending from heaven in small small batches [not as together], in some order\u2014first good souls, then mixed ones and finally those who are not good. Thus by the concluding phase of the Kalpa, heaven might have emptied all the souls on to the earth. Once a soul descends on to the earth, it remains on earth till the conclusion of Kalpa, through the process of reincarnation. Thus number of births each one receives varies: 1. Some will have many incarnations 2. Some will have only just one birth, 3. Those with mixed qualities will have varying number of reincarnations.  Thus many cannot believe in reincarnation because they have only one birth whereas many are sure about reincarnation because they have many births. This means number of souls are fixed, but they descend at various timings. This explains why population gradually increases to reach the present level. ",
