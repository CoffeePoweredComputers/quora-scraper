            "answer_text": "Lets put it this way, Orbitals are, in a strict sense, NOT physical entities Before the quantum mechanical model of the atom, you have the Bohr-idea of electron as a point charge performing circular motion around the nucleus, under the influence of a radially directed electrostatic force. You could obtain a function describing the equation of motion of an electron as Y(r,theta) and with the added constraint that the angular momentum is always be a multiple of h/2pi, you can obtain every possible piece of information about this system, say, where the electron is, its velocity, energy, time period of revolution etc. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle renders the idea of a single point charge called the electron revolving around a fixed orbit, with its position and velocity being possible to determine exactly at all moments in time, obselete. Now, we must acknowledge the wavelike characteristics of the electron as well and conclude that the electron forms standing waves inside the atom So, what happens to our equation of motion? Now it must be replaced with a wavefunction, that describes everything about the electron wave. This wavefunction must be a solution of the Schrodinger Equation The orbitals are simply the visualisation of this electron wave in cartesian co-ordinates, The shapes represent the volume in which the probability of finding the electron is maximum. Now, you cannot obviously see an orbital, as its basically a mathematical concept. However experiments do agree with our predictions about orbitals and their shapes. For instance, the phenomenon of Crystal Field Splitting in co-ordination gives a pretty good intuition about the shape and orientation of d orbitals. ",

            "answer_text": "Before the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we used to say that the electrons revolved around discrete shells called orbits. But, when Heisenberg hypothesized his Uncertainty Principle, the idea of discrete shells became obsolete, as we can\u2019t actually say where the electron is. This lead to the concept of calculating probability distribution of an electrons. The orbitals are the imaginary surfaces where the probability of finding an electron is nearly maximum. And, since there were many such surfaces for approximately same energies so they were clubbed together as orbits, and the individual surface were called orbitals. With all that said let\u2019s answer your questions. Is there really an orbital in atom? No, they are just representation of probability densities. They says different shape of orbitals. Is that real? Yes, there are different shapes of orbitals, each one referring to different spatial orientation. If yes is it observable? No. If not what lead scientist to this conceptual thing? It\u2019s stated above. ",
