            "answer_text": "Hello, Robert! This is from a 2015 article: \u201cDiscovery has canceled one of its longest-running shows. \"MythBusters\" is set to end after its upcoming 14th season. While this may be a surprise for fans, stars Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman had known about the impending goodbye for about a year already. They have been secretly plotting how to make the final season amazing. \"It was my greatest fear that 'MythBusters' would just stop and we wouldn't be able to do proper final episodes,\" Savage told Entertainment Weekly. \"So whether it's myths about human behavior or car stories or explosion stories, we tried to find the most awesome example of each category and build on our past history.\" Savage and Hyneman are expected to do one last MythBusters Livetour, which starts next month. \"MythBusters\" put urban myths, old wives' tales, common beliefs, and superstitions to the test. Previously, Kari Byron, Tory Belleci, and Grant Imahara served as hosts, as well. They were cut last season as the show's ratings began to fall.\u201d Discovery's 'MythBusters' has been canceled I didn\u2019t check if a reboot or return has been planned. ",

Hopefully it doesn\u2019t get pulled off Netflix so I can something to binge watch as I\u2019m recovering from my upcoming back surgery to fix my scoliosis. It was good (and entertaining) while it lasted. Oh well. At least Deadliest Catch didn\u2019t suffer the same fate. (It\u2019s probably still going and shows no signs of slowing down or stopping) ",
