            "answer_text": "The amount of interactive force depends on the rate of change in momentum if no other forces on the colliding objects are significant. The latter situation is often met for collisions because the interactive forces can be many times gravitational forces. Newton\u2019s 2nd Law of Motion is most usefully formulated as: the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of the object\u2019s momentum with respect to time. That means that the instantaneous force during a collision is the derivative of the momentum of one of the objects with time. The average force is the total change in momentum divided by the total change in time during the collision. A simple factor for understanding when the time will be shorter than in other cases is the total amount of compression of the two objects up to the instant when their centers of mass are moving at the same velocity. When the compression is very little, the time will also be small, and the forces will be relatively large. Some things compress relatively easily and some don\u2019t. Everything is compressible to some extent. If this were not true, the time for two objects to reach the same velocity in a collision would be zero, and division by zero is problematic at best! Let\u2019s say that a 1.000 Kg sphere is dropped onto an unusually rigid surface, and most of the compression during the collision is in the sphere. Also take the velocity at first contact to be 10.00 m/s. What forces result if the sphere is compressed by 1.000 cm, 0.1000 cm or 0.01000 cm? These are one hundredth of meter, one thousandth and one ten thousandth of a meter. I\u2019ll just do average stopping force. Since the instantaneous forces continuously change during the collisions, the maximum force could be around twice the average force. For all cases the change in momentum at the time the sphere stops relative to the surface is 10.00 Kgm/s upward (a change from down to stop is in the upward direction). Since the initial speed is 10.00 m/s and the final speed is zero, the average speed during the collision is 5.000 m/s (assuming the velocity changes are linear, this is the average between 0 and 10.00 m/s). With a compression of 1.000 cm (1/100 m), this takes a time of (1/100.0 m)/5.000 m/s = 1/500.0 s or 0.002000 s. The average stopping force is then 10.00 kgm/s/0.002000 s = 5000 N. With a compression of 0.1000 cm, this works out to be 5.000 x 10^4 N. With a compression of 0.01000 cm, it is 5.000 x 10^5 N. In that case the maximum force might be one million N! The fact that this is exceedingly unlikely for most materials is consistent with the fact that compressions as small as 0.01000 cm for such a collision is unlikely. Of course we could make up some exotic material that compresses by only billionths of meters and get really incredible forces. OTOH, if getting smaller forces is desirable, increase the compression distance. This is the idea behind crumple zones in cars. The more the car compresses in a collision, the greater the stopping time, and the less your body needs to compress. Seat belts and air bags can also help a lot. Stopping using brakes is the ideal.

            "answer_text": "These are all good questions because you are thinking. A wonderful thing about first studying physics is that it describes things we already have some intuition about, but we find that some of the intuition is right and some is wrong. Whether the objects bounce or stick together is usually not of concern in a basic physics class, it is a given. If the objects bounce the collision is called elastic. If they stick it is inelastic. Intermediate interactions are possible but more complicated and usually not of concern in a basic physics class. The key thing to know is that momentum is always conserved. In an elastic collision, kinetic energy is also conserved, but for inelastic collisions kinetic energy can be transformed to another form, usually heat. These of course are idealized interactions. Things like friction with the air are ignored. As far as what the maximum force of one object striking another can be, it depends on the time and distance over which the interaction occurs. In an idealized interaction where the interaction time is infinitely small, the force would be infinitely large. This is not realistic. At the atomic level the forces are electro-magnetic and they take place over a finite amount of time and distance. In addition, the force changes during the interaction, so it would be easiest to discuss an average force rather than a peak or largest force. Since you are taking mechanics, and not E&M yet, you should not be concerned. ",
