            "answer_text": "The Old Thermodynamist says: This is a tricky one because of the need for the heat capacity of saturated steam, but we can provide an approximate answer. Constants that we need: Heat capacity of ice is Cpi = 2.108J/g-K Heat of fusion of ice Hi = 333.55J/g Heat capacity of water is Cpw = 4.186J/g-K Heat of vaporization of water Hw = 2257J/g Heat capacity of saturated steam 100C \u2013 123C: Cps = 2.08J/g-K (from steam tables) Now to the question: Heat to raise 65.0g of ice at -14C to 0C: \u0394H1 = m\u2022Cpi\u2022\u0394T = 65.0(2.108)(14) = 1918.28J Heat to melt ice at 0C to water at 0C: \u0394H2 = m\u2022Hi = 65.0(333.55) = 21,680.75J Heat required to bring the water from 0C to 100C: \u0394H3 = m\u2022Cpw\u2022\u0394T = 65.0(4.186)(100) = 27,209J Heat required to vaporize water: \u0394H4 = m\u2022Hw = 65.0(2257) = 146,705J Heat required to raise temperature of saturated steam to 123C: \u0394H5 = 65.0(2.08) = 135.2J Total heat required is the sum of \u0394H(1 to 5) = 197,648.23J ",
