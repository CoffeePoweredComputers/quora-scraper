            "answer_text": "If you mean by any a randomly chosen substance, then no. When you mean \u201cis there a substance\u2026\u201d than yes. It's water. Strangely enough we have been in school, learning about density. I was in awe to understand why ice floats on the water! It grows (increases in volume) when the temperature drops further and further. For the same reason do bottles burst or even explode when being put in a freezer! Once I wanted a cool can of soda and. Popped into the deep freezer. I forgot about it till the next day. The can was bulged. When I left it on a table, it sterted leaking after a while! So water, even mixed to a soda drink, expands when becoming colder. Water starts doing this below (abt) 4 degrees Celsius. A2A hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh yes, water is one. When it freezes. Ever left a bottle of water or another drink in a freezer? Volume can increase with decreasing temperature only if the most stable structural configuration changes. Regular ice has a lot of empty space in it due to the hydrogen bonds holding water molecules in particular positions. It does not depend much on temperature but high pressure can change it. There are some others, like bismuth, silicon, germanium, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure - the most common substance that does this is plain water. Water\u2019s maximum density (minimum volume for a given mass) occurs at 4 degrees C, and decreases as the temperature goes below that. Ice is less dense than liquid water, which of course is why ice cubes float in your drink (even if they are perfectly clear and contain no trapped air). ",
