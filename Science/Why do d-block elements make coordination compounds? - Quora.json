            "answer_text": "The cations of d-block elements have strong tendency to form complexes with certain molecules (e.g.CO,NO,NH3 ...etc) or ions (e.g.F-,Cl\u2212,CN\u2212) called ligands. Their tendency to form complexes is due to two reasons. Small size and high positive charge density of ions of transition metals. Presence of vacant (n\u22121)d orbitals which are of appropriate energy to accept one pair and unshared pair of electrons from the ligands for bonding with them. e.g. of some complex compounds are: [Cu(NH3)4]2+ ,[Ag(NH3)2]+ ,[Fe(CN)6]4- ...etc. ",
