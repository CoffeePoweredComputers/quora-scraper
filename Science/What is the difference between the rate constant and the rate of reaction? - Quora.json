            "answer_text": "The rate of a reaction is a number given in mol/sec, whereas the rate constant is a value that must be determined experimentally from a rate of a reaction. For example, one can write for a given reaction A + B => AB (only after experimental evidence shows the order of each of the reactants!)  if it is known that A is a second-order reactant and B is a first-order reactant. The quantity \u201crate\u201d is the rate of reaction and \u201ck\u201d is the constant that allows us to calculate the rate of reaction for any given concentration of reactants. ",
