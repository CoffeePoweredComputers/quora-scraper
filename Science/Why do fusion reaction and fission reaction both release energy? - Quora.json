            "answer_text": "This is a great question! You're right that they're both opposite processes; fusion releases energy by joining nuclei, but fission releases energy by splitting nuclei. There's another key difference though: fusion only works (releases energy) on light nuclei, and fission only works on heavy ones. Despite the mechanistic difference, both processes actually rely on the same underlying principle; namely, they're both reconfiguring the nucleus in such a way as to increase its negative binding energy. This results in a reduction of the overall nuclear mass/energy. This reduction, called the mass defect, or simply [math]\\Delta m[/math], is the energy you get from a nuclear reaction according to Einstein's mass-energy relation: [math]E = \\Delta mc^2[/math] So what is binding energy? Binding energy is the energy that holds the nucleus together. It's a result of the strong nuclear force, which attracts nucleons (protons and neutrons) to each other when they're in extremely close proximity; about the diameter of one or two protons. If you were able to somehow separate the nucleons in the nucleus from each other, you'd have to do work against the strong nuclear force in pulling them apart. The binding energy represents this amount of work: it's how much energy you'd need to expend to unbind the nucleus. By convention we say that the binding energy is negative. This is because you'd have to do work on the nucleons -- you'd have to add positive energy to them -- to separate them from each other. The bound state of the nucleons therefore has lower energy than the separated state; it has more negative binding energy. So how does fusion release energy? For a light nucleus this is fairly straightforward. You're adding nucleons to the nucleus, thereby increasing the number of strong force bonds in the nucleus. Each bond contributes negative binding energy, so that the total mass/energy of the nucleus is less than the sum of its components. This difference in mass/energy gets released as heat and other forms of radiation in the process. So how does fission release energy? This has to do with the fact that the strong force that attracts nucleons is short-ranged, but the coulomb (electrical) force that repels protons in the nucleus is long-ranged. Because of this, a nucleon is only able to attract other nucleons within its immediately vicinity; the attraction only spans a portion of the nucleus. But a proton contributes a repulsive force that's felt across the entire nucleus. The result is that fusing heavy nuclei gives you a net increase in the nuclear energy (for heavy nuclei, fusion adds more repulsive energy than attractive energy). This is why fusion, for heavy nuclei, is unfavorable. Fission, on the other hand, splits heavy nuclei into smaller ones that are more tightly bound -- once again, due to the difference in range between the strong and the coulomb forces. As a result, the smaller \"daughter\" nuclei gain negative binding energy, which results in lower combined mass/energy than that of their parents. This difference in mass/energy, again, is what gets released as heat and other forms of radiation. The dividing line: So far, we've referred to light and heavy nuclei without actually defining these terms. So here are the definitions: a light nucleus is one that's lighter than iron (atomic number 26); a heavy nucleus is one that's heavier than iron. Iron forms the dividing line, where the favorability of fission and fusion cross. You can see this in the binding  energy plot posted in the answer from Maciej Lewicki. One final note: the preceding discussion is a bit simplified, since we've ignored some subtle effects due to things like nuclear surface tension, quantum mechanics, etc. The overall picture, though, should give you a conceptual idea of how the processes work.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a layman and I describe phenomena fairly simply. When fusing 2 nuclei together, think of it as to bodies crashing into each other. They produce energy and debris and they coalesce to form a bigger body. You\u2019ll find that, in fusion reactions, other particles (like shrapnel) come out of the reaction as well as energy. Similarly for fission reactions: imagine you take a sledgehammer and strike a large object. That object gets broken into smithereens with a few large chunks and a lot of debris. Some of the debris is transformed into energy according to [math]E = mc^2[/math] and other energy is in the form of KE of all the particles involved. In fission reactions, the original nucleus has more total energy than the sum of the daughter nuclei (as they\u2019re called in the trade) with the difference being released as heat and light energy plus the KE of all particles involved. Don\u2019t forget the total energy of the debris. What scientists keep out of their explanations to lay people, is the debris that gets produced in nuclear reactions some of which are used to sustain the nuclear reaction. And they stick to binding energy as an explanation. Think of it as the total energy of the fissile material is greater than the sum of the energies of the resulting particles of the fission reaction with the missing energy being in the form of nuclear energy and KE of all particles involved. Similarly with fusion, the total energy of the final products is less than the sum of the original nuclei that were being fused. The difference in energy is released as nuclear energy and KE of all particles involved especially that of the debris. ",
