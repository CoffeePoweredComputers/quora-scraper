            "answer_text": "Europa is thought to have subsurface liquid water. Scientists hypothesize that Europa's hidden ocean is salty, tidal, and causes its ice surface to move, resulting in large fractures which are clearly visible in the above image. Although Europa is thought to have the ingredients needed to support life \u2014 water, energy, organic compounds \u2014 it lies outside of our solar system's habitable zone.  Currently, Earth is the only known planet (or moon) to have consistent, stable bodies of liquid water on its surface. In our solar system, Earth orbits around the sun in an area called the habitable zone. The temperature, along with an ample amount of atmospheric pressure within this zone, allows water to be liquid for long periods of time. Evidence points to water on other planets in our solar system. In 2015, NASA confirmed that liquid water flows intermittently on present-day Mars. Also in 2015, scientists used data from NASA's Cassini mission to discover that a global ocean lies beneath the icy crust of Saturn's moon Enceladus. Scientists believe that Jupiter's moon Europa has a subsurface ocean as well. Finding liquid water beyond our solar system may indicate the existence of extraterrestrial life. Using data collected by NASA's Kepler spacecraft and the W.M. Keck Observatory, scientists have determined that 22 percent of solar-type stars in our galaxy have Earth-sized planets in their habitable zone and could host life. Some of these planets are a mere 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye in the night's sky. Cheers :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Using Copernican argument it is very easy to think that other exoplanets have water. But let\u2019s check our own solar system for this purpose. Scientists studying solar system often call major moons in the Jovian system as planets,. For instance, Titan, Enceladus, and Europa. Now we know these moons have water, see picture of Enceladus (photo credit: NASA)  And Europa is likely to host an ocean under its frozen surface. In fact we are very sure as far as I have been hearing from people studying Europa. Check the following article for more detail: Does Jupiter's Moon Europa Have a Subsurface Ocean? Here's What We Know And in exoplanets we have found this :  This was hot-Jupiter WASP-121 b, and it clearly shows bump at around 1.4 microns, which is a spectral feature of water. If this system was further away the water could have been in liquid form. And if present in a super-earth or terran world, an ocean is not too hard to think about.
