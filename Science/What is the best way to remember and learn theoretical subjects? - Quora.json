            "answer_text": "There is a way to read and understand and enjoy Theoretical Ideas (of any subject). But nobody tells it for they seem it\u2019s obvious and students usually get it on the way but in the meantime, they have lost the time too. I have studied my patterns of thoughts and feelings that come along the way while studying these during my undergraduate days and I think this applies to most of us. Have a clear idea of why you are reading this topic or subject.Yes, in this case, you are reading this to understand something new and please ensure that when you will be frustrated, the aim of learning something new must motivate yourself. Although it is less frustrating if you can really understand on the go. So you may skip this point.Get a bird\u2019s eye view of the topic you are reading. Knowing this you will read between the lines. Often it is hard to read between the lines without getting a bird\u2019 eye view i.e. exactly what is the subject all about.This is the difference between Storybooks and Subject books. Storybooks give you a flow of ideas and then you immerse in its understanding and can predict what is coming next. That\u2019s when you get excited. This excitement is missing when we read subject books because most subject books are unfortunately not written in that manner. The only reason is to make it economical. So you don\u2019t get a flow of ideas and that\u2019s where you stop and get frustrated.Read Between the LinesYes, it is very important whether you read a book or a paper or understand a sarcastic statement by your friend. So what exactly happens is that read between the lines is sort of a skill. So you need to develop that by the following points.Question yourself why this step is done this way and not that way. With this, you will understand and read between the lines. This step is the most crucial and the most important one. It helps to make better teachers and narrators. Often people assume that it is natural. I often see it is natural for my friends but not natural for me. Through this questioning, you are making your base strong.Seek for examples for anything new and abstract.New abstract concepts come from examples. When there are a lot of examples behaving the same way they generalize. Often reading the generalized versions give the shittiest feelings of life. So seek for example. Your brain remembers in form of examples only not in forms of abstract objects. But Yes Definitions are really important. There comes the next point.Understand the definitions fully and Why the definition is given that way only.As I have mentioned this art of questioning and asking the right questions is really important for understanding something very efficiently and to the deep. Human Beings created the definition and they do it the easiest way for essentially they will not do an extra effort right? So they have a clear cut reasoning behind each naming and definition and often it is related to the historical development.Try to learn the history of the topic and how it developed.Everything we do is a flow of something, dynamic in nature. So if you come to know the history you will be enlightened how people thought of it and you will feel great and your understanding and the topic or subject will get a liveliness as you associate with the people and the history. Yes, it just makes your subject Lively and beautiful.Please do the exercises efficiently. It is very important if you want to get some motivation that you understood something. Often there are monotonous exercises where the same idea is used time and again. Try to identify them and do a few of them. While good authors give new concepts and ideas in the exercises. Try to identify them (often the authors mention them) and solve them with dedication. Question yourself about every question and the importance of it. Try to form your new questions. If you get stuck in a question, dig into your basics. Yes, sometimes you have to work really hard.Try to form your new questionsYes as I have mentioned try to form your questions they are as important as those given in the book.Discuss with your friends, interact with your teacher.Yes, it makes the subject lively and enjoyable when we get the ideas from each other. Often it varies from people to people. Some want to understand them from their point of view but is also important to understand others\u2019 views.Teach it to someone, write and share your thoughts.Yes, when you understand something you will see that you have an urge to get your knowledge out of you. Then just write, share your knowledge on Quora, Stack Exchange, etc. This gives you a good feeling and motivates yourself. Also if you like to keep a journal of your ideas, you can surely do it.Find a Good Book and Follow the stepsYou will see that there a few books who just touch your heart and follow all the points 1 -7 for you, but it is very hard to find such books. So go to the library shelf or search in the Google for a good book and go through the book whether a pdf or hard copy it doesn\u2019t matter and based on your position and requirements seek a book that seems ideal for you.There are actually 3 steps in general: Getting an impression about the subject (1 -2 Points)Learning the subject (3 -7 Points)Testing and Sharing your Knowledge (8 - 11 Points)Often you will find that there is hardly any person to answer your questions. So just google your question in an efficient way. Quora, Stack Exchange are good sources for learning this and getting similar questions like yours. If you like it, please share these with your friends so that everyone can enjoy the learning process. These methods apply to any subject. Happy Learning.Hope it helps. :) Srijit Mukherjee. ",

            "answer_text": "I am currently pursuing Chartered Accountancy & I feel that I might be able to answer this question. - The Theory Trap There are two types of people in this world : The Rote-ary Club : From page 1, they feed every single word in the book inside their tiny little brains. Their speed is 100 words/minute. The brain holds the freshly hammered memory for a while, then snap - it\u2019s gone. The Conceptual Bubble : These people, they understand what\u2019s happening first. They spend a considerable time understanding every tiny little detail. The memory therefore, is hammered well & stays for much longer. But soon things start to fade away.It doesn\u2019t matter what club you\u2019re from, after a while - everything fades. - Do you remember that scene when Christian Bale made the climb without the rope in \u2018The Dark Knight Rises\u2019? It was euphoric wasn\u2019t it? What did you have to do to remember it though ? That\u2019 the problem with Theory subjects. They lack that lustre. They are mundane. Very very boring. They don\u2019t excite you. They don\u2019t dilate your pupils. Theory doesn\u2019t stick ( unless it strikes you with awe ) Back to the question. How do we made something so boring stick ? - Sticky Stories : Words, actions & thoughts stick in two ways :P1 :Either something really interesting happens which blows your mind off. Or you read something that is just really really interesting.P2 :Or you keep repeating something day-in day-outWhich one sounds more exciting ? I mean what if we apply P1 to theory ?The answer is stories. Our brains love stories & hates facts. If you can re-arrange your theory content into a story - you can just stop here.The Spider\u2019s Web :Maybe the story stuff is just not feasible in your case. The Spider\u2019s Web comes to our aid. Re-arrange your theory content into smaller bits of information. Then, connect the dots. Create charts & flowcharts.Visual Imagery :I know this will sound crazy, but every time you learn a new concept, try to visualize a weird analogy around it. For example : You are learning a concept on Dividend Declaration. Imagine a crazy shareholder walking into a company & arguing with Executive Manager. Visualize him raising several cocky questions & visualize the Manager answer these questions with ease.Drawings & Scribbles :Theory has no pictures, which makes it so much more boring.To infuse a spark of liveliness into the subject, draw something funny. When you will sit back to recall the concepts, its the drawings that will flow right back to youRe-vision :I\u2019ve kept the most important & boring point at the end. Because \u2018Revision\u2019 sounds really bad. This word gives you negative vibes.But there is simply no way around it. You can apply the 4 techniques I\u2019ve mentioned & it will help you, but if you skip this step - its all back to ZERO",
