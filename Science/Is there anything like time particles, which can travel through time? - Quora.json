            "answer_text": "Yes the photons of EM Radiation. If any object is moving with the speed of light, then there is no such a thing like \u201ctime\u201d to those objects in their frame of reference,even if the object had a trip around the universe, means that their clock doesn\u2019t show even a plank time, i.e time is always zero in their frame.  The photons of light don\u2019t have a clock (or a thing called time ) when they are moving in free space with speed c. in other words they don\u2019t know what is time? as we experience. From the above expression it is obvious that except the photons of EM radiation ,no other object can move with speed c. For all smaller velocities/ speeds everything in the universe moving in time ( except gravitationally space collapsed ( black holes) or space generating ( white holes/points), rest of all has to have a clock.
