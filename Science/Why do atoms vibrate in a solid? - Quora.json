            "answer_text": "Because there's no such thing as a solid. It's just a convenient abstraction.  The only thing that anybody's ever found is energy. Matter is just a specific kind of energy. Everything moves all the time. The clumps of energy that are called matter are actually fantastically far apart relative to their size. Imagine how far apart stars are from each other; that's how far apart atoms are. ",

            "answer_text": "In a solid atoms are held in place by chemical bonds. To a first approximation the bonds are like springs. The atoms have some energy due to the temperature and this is a vibration about its mean position. The motion tends to distribute the energy ensuring an even temperature. ",
