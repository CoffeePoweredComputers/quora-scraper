            "answer_text": "Because they're not set up for such. Metal dtectors can be set up to discriminate certain metals at certain settings. When you use a detector to find (or detect) gold you're discriminating other metals. In practical use (airports) if it detects any gold it could let steel or iron pass unnoticed or even beep like crazy for anything as small as a tooth crown. ",

Gold is non-ferrous.Airports are however progressively rolling out more advanced scanners that can detect gold, non-ferrous metals, gems, drugs, ceramics and basically anything concealed - using back-scatter X-Rays and terahertz technology.
