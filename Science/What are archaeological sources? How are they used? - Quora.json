            "answer_text": "Archaeological sources include ALL physical evidence of past cultures. So at one end you might have large monumental construction, such as Stone Henge or Castles, at the other end you have soil micromorphology, which can tell you about ancient ecosystems, or microscanning of rocks and tools which can reveal marks invisible to the naked eye, or indeed paleao DNA analysis. Then you have everything in between, as people interact with their environment they will shape materials into tools, they will also inadvertently leave markers in the environment, which could include wear patterns on frequently used paths, or ash deposits from fires, the bones of creatures hunted and consumed, or the ard marks of ancient ploughing techniques. Just imagine the ways in which you interact with the physical world and every conceivable physical trace you might leave, it is all potential archaeology. The variety of techniques that now detect unseen data are increasingly exciting. So we can now sample soil from specific areas of graves in order to analyse the trace chemicals left by internal organs. We can analyse the surface of ancient greek marbles to detect traces of the bright paint pigments that once covered them. The vast majority of data will come from the everyday objects that our ancestor produced and used, from pottery to iron tools, to ovens, to mill stones or spinning weights, to flint tools, to the discarded shells of nuts preserved in anaeorobic soils, to mortars or daubs used in structures. The list would be vast. There are probably sources that we have not even yet discovered and that further research will reveal. On a slightly more theoretical note, we may use diverse sources to help interpret this data, including anthropological, philosophical, psychological, and the post-modernists would even include the experience of the archaeologist who are excavating. A full answer to your question would require a full book or several, but hopefully this gives an idea of the scope involved. ",

            "answer_text": "The purpose of archaeology is to throw light on the past. This is done through discovery and study of archaeological sources. Archaeological sources can include ancient remains and monuments recovered as a result of excavation and exploration, skeletal remains, the ruins of buildings and tombs, artefacts such as pottery, weapons, tools and coins, inscriptions and stone carvings and dumps (middens), Some archaeologists even work underwater to find sources on the sea bed such as ancient shipwrecks. These archaeological remains are subjected to scientific examination of radio-carbon method for its dates. ",
