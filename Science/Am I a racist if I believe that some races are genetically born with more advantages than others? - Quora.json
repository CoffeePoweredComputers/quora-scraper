            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t have to be a racist. You could simply be a biologist or geneticist looking at real human traits and their advantages and disadvantages. A white person with European genetics is going to get sunburned if out in the sun too long unprotected. Those with darker skin can go much longer in the sun. The Zulu people tend to be very tall. So there are some physical jobs they can generally do better than some groups of people in South America that tend to be fairly short. It\u2019s not racists to say what is true. But it does become racist when we either judge or attempt to limit people based on these traits. It would be racists not to let a white person play baseball simply because they have to spend a lot of time out in the sun. It would be racist to only allow people from the Zulu nation to play basketball because they are usually tall. And it would be racist to not let certain people from South American play basketball because they are generally shorter. In truth, humans are very adaptable. And it\u2019s wrong to limit people just because of some very generalized characteristic of their race. Instead, everyone deserves to be judged individually based on their personal merits. But it is okay to study traits in general and how they apply to different races of people. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as different races of humans. The only species of human alive is Homo sapiens. All of the others have gone extinct. Learn to discuss humans without the concept of race. Yes it is true that certain ethnic groups have advantages but they also have disadvantages. White people, no matter what ethnic background, tend to not do as well in the sun as native African groups do. Certain groups of people with the gene for Tay Sachs disease are more resistant to tuberculosis. The genes for Tay Sachs is notably found in many people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The genes for sickle cell anemia are more common in people of African descent. They tend to have resistance to malaria. So no, the idea itself isn\u2019t \u201cracist\u201d because it\u2019s based in fact. Racism would be happening if people weren\u2019t allowed to participate in certain aspects of society because of these genetic \u201cdisadvantages.\u201d ",

The first definition I googled was: \u201cthe belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.\u201d (Definition of Racism by Lexico) The Encyclopedia Britannica says Racism \u201cis the ideology that humans may be divided into separate and exclusive biological entities called \u2018races\u2019; that there is a causal link between inherited physical traits and traits of personality, intellect, morality, and other cultural and behavioral features; and that some races are innately superior to others.\u201d (racism | Definition) To clear up the matter, there are no races in genetics. The races set out in the United States Census are \u201cnot an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically\u201d. Genetics is not colour coded. The reality of humanity is one of gradual genetic change across overlapping regions and significant variation within populations. By believing in races (racialism), and then believing people in races have certain genetics, and then believing races having advantages over others \u2026 that\u2019s textbook racism. ",

Bad Boy\u201d\u2026or it's simply a case of me not wanting to take an honest look at myself and the world and what my role is in it as well as not bothering to consult all possible sources on subjects like the colonization of the Americas, Africa, and Asia.
