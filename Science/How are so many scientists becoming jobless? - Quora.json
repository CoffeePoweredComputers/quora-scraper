            "answer_text": "Not only scientist, all the candidates are facing unemployment crisis. Specifically to scientists, unless the country spends money on research, there will be no research. If you do not have research, there is no need of a scientist to do the research. But now you can argue that scientist can work in academic institutes; the counter argument to that is how many academic institutes do have that kind of lab setup & money for a full scale research? Thus, unless the govt. is inclined towards research, the unemployment of scientists will continue. ",
