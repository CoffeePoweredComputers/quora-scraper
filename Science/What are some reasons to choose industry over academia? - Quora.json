            "answer_text": "Here are four common scenarios for leaving academia for industry: Early bad experience. Some PhD students go to grad school because they are stellar students, and they do not think through the experience much beyond that. Then in grad school they experience teaching as a teacher for the first time, and they find they hate teaching \u2014 absolutely despise it and detest it. In that case, choosing an industry research job is often a worthwhile career choice. Post graduation bad experience. Sometimes PhD students go through grad school with only a little (and relatively harmless) teaching experience, and then they experience teaching as a professor. They must grade exams and homework on late nights, and discipline poor behavior in the classroom, and deal with some of the unpleasant experiences of a poorly supported classroom. A few years of such experiences can wipe away any delusion of glamour, and can lead someone to look for an industry job. Again, in that case, it is often a worthwhile choice. The academic lifestyle loses its appeal. Most academic jobs do not pay well, especially right out of a PhD. Many of academics rationalize the situation by convincing themselves they like the lifestyle (e.g., freedom over their agenda, interesting conversation, etc). Occasionally somebody can get into an academic position, and then the burdens of life hit hard \u2014 baby, debt, and other living expenses. It is reasonable to look around and want something nice for your kids \u2014 more than a used car, a home with more appeal than a poorly lit apartment, and shelves that are not made of long boards and cinder-blocks. In some fields industry can pay much better, and the change can result in an enormous change in lifestyle. Academic science loses touch with the frontier. Most academic research depends on grants, and sometimes grants are hard to come by. In some fields great research requires expensive equipment or data, and sometimes academic funding does not exist for it. Sometimes industry is willing to pay for all the toys and data, and is willing to fund long term jobs. Those can be great positions, and more interesting than anything in academics. I have seen all these scenarios, but please do not read too much into the glibness of this answer. It can work out, but \u2014 to be fair about it \u2014 it is a dramatic change in work conditions. Managing this transition can lead to many complex challenges. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "I was dead sure I was going to be a social sciences professor until I started my job at Victoria\u2019s Secret as a sales associate last November. And last month after I got another job offer from somewhere else that made me realize I\u2019m in love with my job, my store, my brand, my colleagues and everything about it, I suddenly saw that I\u2019m going to advance in here and not go on with my academic studies after I get my masters done. Of which I\u2019m at the thesis stage and already done with the course work pretty satisfyingly. The reasons: -Fun: Academia is no fun. Yes it\u2019s nice to discuss things with highly intellectual people and find a meaning to certain discussions, show a new side to them and make people approach the particular issues with a new attitude, but. Still. I\u2019m the type that likes to enjoy life. Have you ever heard the songs they play at Victoria\u2019s Secret stores? I hardly contain myself from going on clubbing mode in the store. Oh and those settings, the visuals! Gosh, I love me some VS and its sometimes sexy, sometimes glam, sometimes princess-y products displayed in such glory! Ain\u2019t no such thing in academia, right? -Income: Our store manager earns around 120k a year. No such thing in the academia. This is retail and it\u2019s the high end version. You hardly make half of that here in Turkey if you go on with academia. And that much bucks would provide you super nice vacations when you take your highly deserved yearly time offs as we work 6 days a week. PLUS: Our store manager was flown to Shangai for 5 days, all expenses paid, to watch Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show 2017. What the freak beats that perk??! -Social aspect: Retail industry is a heaven for extroverts like me. We get to meet at least 5 new people every single day. Even our store crew is around 40 people. You are in a constant interaction mood. Think about The Sims and their socializing aspects. That bar they have there never falls down to orange levels in this industry. It\u2019s always pretty green. -Constantly changing and updated, short lived goals to achieve: Every day has its total selling target. Be it the total turnover rate, the number of bras to sell, the EDP targets, the conversion rate targets. These are all exciting to wait for the end of the day to see what is achieved and what could be done more. Plus, your personal sales record for the day. The total amount your customers bought, the number of people that gave your name in the cash register when they are asked who helped them with their shopping that day. The number of bras those customers bought with your help. These are super exciting. Any such thing in academia? Don\u2019t think so. These are the main things with a few other equally fun and solid reasons I have for giving up on the pursuit of possibly becoming a Media and Communications professor. I\u2019m really happy now, happy as I\u2019ve never been. Funny how life changes with a choice you made you initially thought would be temporary. But this was the best thing I ever said \u201cyes\u201d to. ",
