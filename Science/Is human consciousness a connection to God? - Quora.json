One of my books has an interesting, if disturbing, title \u201cYou Are In God: God Is In You\u201d and so the connection is complete, but so many of us have believed the nonsense that we are taught, by most of society, that there can be no connection because they say there can be no such connection; their saying that this is so makes it so! So There!! . All that being said, especially if one believes some who are researching both \u2018human consciousness\u2019 and the possible \u2018Consciousness of the Universe\u2019 then, Yes!, our our consciousness is our connection to God. That same research, at least from some, is rewording things to say that our minds are not created by our brains, although they use them, and the Consciousness of the Universe is The Mind and our mind and The Mind are in complete connection. Some of those who are trying to develop a Theory of Everything, from the bottom up, have accepted that there is such a thing as dimensionless Information (sometimes called Pure Information) that is fundamental to everything in the universe and it is that dimensionless Information (dimensionless like numbers are dimensionless) that guides the ordered formation of Energy and matter (a special form of Energy). Many words have multiple meanings (this is always so in any language) and some talk at cross purposes because of that, but it is likely true that our consciousness and The Consciousness of the Universe do connect. Since much of this is going on in Science, and even the most open of Science types hate to cross over the line to talking about Philosophy and Religion, we may not be able to get them to make a powerful statement about this and have them agree - those in Science who even hint that they are using tools and concepts from Philosophy get shunned as crazy ones who have seriously-sinned! LoL This crazy one (I have been such since my earliest memories) says it out loud, however; \u201cOur consciousness is at least one part of our connection to God!\u201d Love and Above to all who seek the Truth!

            "answer_text": "Not to me, but it may seem like it to those who are religious and believe in one god or another. Consciousness is simply a state in which we are awake and aware of ourselves, our thoughts and our surroundings. And it is also a state in which we can perceive and make contact with other human beings and whatever else may be around us and accomplish tasks that need to get done. There are other creatures on earth who also sleep and wake up and experience a state of consciousness. Most of them are probably not aware of or able to consider the existence of a God although they may see humans as having magical or godlike qualities when we obtain tasty food from a can or bag and feed it to them or step into a noisy contraption and drive away or take them for a ride. I had a Siamese cat once who loved riding in the car next to my head on the bench seat of the car. Nutmeg would provide me with a steady stream of instructions about what to watch for how fast or slow to go and to look out for other cars and remind me of where and when to turn. Once I got stopped by a cop for not making a complete stop at a stop sign when there was nothing coming from either direction and she told him in no uncertain terms that we had looked both ways before going through the stop sign so he decided to just give us a warning instead of a ticket. She provided us with thirty kittens who we were able to give away easily because they were soooooooooooo very CUTE\u2026. ",

Mankind does not have a connection with God that is just there, like leaving your computer on and connected to the internet, not at this time in history. Even with prayer we do not have an automatic connection. The scripture says even though you make many prayers, I am not listening. With bloodshed your hands are filled. Wash yourselves, make yourseves clean, remove the badness of your dealings from in front of my eyes, cease to do bad. Learn to do good, search for justice, set right the oppressor, render judgment for the fatherless boy, plead the cause of the widow. Human consciousness is a gift of God, one of our characteristics inherent to mankind that Jehovah created. We must use it to connect with God, true, but we must be proper to connect with Him. The human mind, our intellect, the marvel of the earthly creation, gives us an inkling of what God is like, for mankind were made in His image. Just remember, God is holy, clean, undefiled, perfect in justice and love and wisdom, and as the Source of life, deserves honorable homage, no less. By proper respect, you may connect to God. Go ahead and try it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. In the same way that the International Space Station is connected to man. God created us with all the necessary parts and characteristics needed to be able to commune with Him. Our consciousness is who we are. We have a soul, which gives us our awareness of the world around us. And we have a spirit, which once we turn towards God, believing that He desires to commune with us and that He provided a unique way for us to do that in His Son Jesus, then we can have an awareness towards God. God not only created us with the capacity to commune with Him, He later promised to help us in the process; as the Bible says in James 4:8. \u2018Come near to God and He will come near to you.\u2019 Then He gives further guidance as to what we should do next. Being able to talk to God is a wonderful, miraculous facility that God has given to us. We should not ignore it but take the time every day to come into His presence and tell Him how we feel. We can ask Him for help, for ourselves and for others. We would be wise to exercise our conscious ability to commune with God. For that is why we have it! ",

            "answer_text": "Personally I don\u2019t delve into spirituality matters in Quora. Two reasons for that: I do not believe in a theistic God or in anything other than a theistic God who created the world outside of him/her/it. Very often, it is hard not to talk about the theistic (personified) God on this front if you want talk about spirituality. Second thing is that the kinds of things I like to talk in Quora (like evolution) negate that divine intervention completely. Not only the fact that the question asked here is quite clever, but Martin Galilean\u2019s wonderful response as well made me to write this. Martin is right on to something in a philosopher\u2019s kind of way when he said \u201cI also talked a time ago with a friend who is a Buddhist monk about this topic. One idea we all shared coming from different starting points is that there could be just one consciousness and our personalities some kind of illusion that separate us. Personally i don\u2019t think illusion as fake, or lie, but as secondary phenomena, an emergent\u201d. Speaking of all of this from personal experiences and personal thoughts, can anyone better this one, I very much doubt. I will congratulate him and ask him to work a bit more on this In Hindu philosophy, the Ultimate Reality is alternatively defined as Pure Consciousness which is also immanent in everything and transcendent past everything animate or inanimate The theory as we know is mostly perfected by Adi Shankara (Some thinkers try to imagine Shankara and Buddha as two sides of the same coin in that one denied the existence of a Supreme One beyond the Universe and the other one denied the existence of the Universe to settle for the Ultimate Reality. Both agreed that there could be only one, not two). Now coming back this theory about Pure Consciousness, there is a famous saying that everyone repeats but I am not sure everyone really understands. It is simply this: AHAM BRHMAM ASMI\u201d \u2013 which roughly translates as I am just droplet in the Ocean of Pure Consciousness. It is interpreted to mean that there are no individual souls but One Pure Consciousness. Water droplet has no meaning in a separate existence outside of the ocean. It is amazing that not only did Mr. Gavilian give a perfect response to the question; he also showed that he is very versant in a topic that many Hindus themselves avoid trying to grasp. Beyond Polytheism and Monotheism, at a much higher level there is a discussion going on between two schools of thought one claiming absolute Monism or Nondualism and the other one claiming there is a Dualism. (As an aside and for the benefit of Mr. Gavilian himself, I might add that there is this thing called Theory of Perfection which can be distilled as follows: The Ultimate Reality is perfect. A Perfect thing cannot be made out of individual parts such as Matter and individual souls. It is one seamless whole. But nothing can exist outside of it because it is perfect. It cannot diminish in perfection; it cannot become more perfect. So, admitting its existence negates the existence of Universe itself; it then become that the Universe is an illusion. And admitting to the existence of a Universe apart and away from that Perfect Reality makes the existence of the Perfect Reality itself invalid. This is the nondualitic conundrum. At this juncture, Buddha and Shankara diverge.) ",

            "answer_text": "It probably is. The human consciousness, that is the awareness of reality, the fact that we can experience our lives, the fact that we cannot know for sure if other people are experiencing life too or not, they could be organic machines, robots with brain muscles for a computer and their consciousness could not exist for all we know. But each individual person knows that he or she is experiencing life and so we can only logically assume that other people are too. This is something to think about and it's very abstract. There doesn't really seem to be a decided word in our vocabulary to describe it. I think consciousness is a good way to describe it but some people might want to call it a soul or spirit, something that would probably live on even after our bodies decay, something that wouldn't be bound to our bodies in the event of our deaths. It is most certainly proof that there are things in existence that scientists have most definitely not explained, even though they are right in front of us staring us right in the face. ",

            "answer_text": "Having understood the importance of the spirit (Ruh) and the spiritual life, it is natural to pursue our discussion with this topic, the spirit. The issue of spirit is one of the oldest problems confounding the human mind. Even the earliest human beings were aware of a non-material entity within them. They were aware of different states and levels of consciousness in their lives, and by comparing sleep and death with their normal awake state reached some preliminary conclusions. They were also cognisant of the fact that humans are different from animals, with the latter lacking free will and wisdom. Animals just seemed to follow their instincts. They also thought about dreams. Dreams which came true were especially intriguing. Without being able to articulate it, they had an inkling that this might be the result of a part of the Person taking leave, traversing the future. As human societies developed, such problems were delegated to philosophers who were good at thinking and reflecting. Philosophy confronted the issue by first asking: Is the spirit material or non-material? In other words, is this phenomenon part of our bodies or not? Material things have specific properties, for instance they can be divided into smaller parts which can also be divided into parts once more, ad infinitum, if the means were available. They also knew that if a person lost a limb, he or she was essentially the same person, with a handicap. Their notions of themselves did not seem to suffer in the process. Thus, many philosophers concluded that the soul is independent of the body. This theory was further strengthened when they considered the notions of \u201cI\u201d, \u201cmine\u201d and \u201cme\u201d, as distinct features of the person. Is the person, this unit of a human being, material or non-material? As noted with the loss of limb example, philosophers knew that humans even after losing parts of themselves were the same. We all seem to have an understanding of ourselves as a whole, as something which is not divisible, and which is simple and not compound. When we get our hair cut, we do not feel any less afterwards. That which remains besides our body and is not on the floor of the barbershop is what we are after. Let us use another example to help clarify this illusive topic. When a person commits a crime, especially a heinous one such as masterminding mass killings, as the Nazis did in WWII, he is expected to be brought to justice, even if he committed the crimes half a century ago. Science tells us that the average person's body cells are nearly all renewed every six years. For all practical purposes we are not physically the same person we were, say ten years ago. Why then should the Nazi officer, whose body bears little resemblance to the one which carried out the atrocities, be apprehended, tried, and punished? We intuitively understand that we are not losing some parts of our being which must be replaced. The unity of identity which we feel is not justified only through physical continuity. So there seems to be universal recognition of the fact that, what animates a person is ultimately constant, and is held responsible for the whole of the person body and spirit. Because the two are so closely interwoven, and because we humans are so deeply anchored in this physical, material world, we tend to identify with the body rather than the spirit. In Islam there is no doubt that the spirit is the essence of the person, and the body a vehicle for the manifestation of the soul in this world, and a means for its works. There is a set of reasons proving the existence of the spirit through the study of our knowledge. If we prove that our knowledge is not material, it will be clear that we are not merely bodies. For example, it is obvious that a greater thing cannot be placed in a smaller thing. A big box can easily accommodate an smaller one put into it. The reverse does not hold. Then imagine gazing at a beautiful forest for a while, savouring all that stands before you. Later on when you remember the experience with all its grandeur, little thought is given to the size of the forest, which is, in a way, now stored within your memory. Whatever one might call it the idea, picture, or the experience of the forest fits neatly within a person's mind which is rather limited in size. We wonder how a forest, with all its characteristics and size can fit into our consciousness. The problem is not solved if we imagine small microfilms, for instance, which are pictures of what we see, and are in one way or another, stored in our minds. Even extremely small microfilms have dimensions, which, when added together, would soon leave no more room in our minds for anything else. Also when you have microfilms you are in need of some means to be able to interpret those microfilms, You also need some ability to understand things in their real sizes. There is a difference between seeing a small picture of a forest and seeing the forest itself. This is a rather difficult issue which has puzzled many of scientists. As a matter of fact, when a survey of top scientists, including Nobel laureates, was conducted recently, the vast majority, when asked what will be the most important field of research in the next decade, gave psychobiology as the answer. It is somewhat well understood that neurones in our brains, through sensors, spread out like roots, pulses, electrical signals, if you will, by which they interact with billions of other cells. Brain waves are this measured, charted, and studied. Yet the nature of information storage is not well understood. The repeated actions of a person, for instance an athlete after intense training which involves repeated motions of the same kind, do indeed leave physical traces in the physiology of the brain; as a stream of water would after running down the same path for a while. This enables the athlete to perform extremely difficult tasks without \u201cthinking\u201d or great effort at co-ordination. Yet this explains only part of the process. This is the wiring system, so to speak, and not the process of cognition, information storage, and retrieval. In what form the athlete's skills are stored is still not understood. The question occupying many minds is: Is the physical brain the gateway unto something else, or is it all there is, and the end Of all that has to do with cognition? I hope we have understood how to answer this question without being engaged in technical discussions of philosophy. There are many other ways to prove that knowledge is not material. For example, knowledge is not changeable, but every material. thing is. For instance, today is Saturday. You have the knowledge that you are reading a book on self-knowledge this day. This knowledge is true today. When you think of it tomorrow, it will be the same. Your knowledge about this particular book will be the same after a week, a year, or say even twenty years after. When you forget something what this really means is that particular data have been lost which cannot be easily retracted tom the memory storage. By no means does it mean that your knowledge has altered. The Spirit ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer from the philosophy of GWF Hegel. Yes, our consciousness is our link to the Geist, the Spirit, which is the Absolute Idea, which is God. Hegel called human consciousness, \u201cfinite spirit,\u201d while he called God\u2019s consciousness, \u201cAbsolute Spirit.\u201d Hegel says: The definition of God is that God is the Absolute Idea -- i.e. that God is Spirit. (Hegel, 1827, LPR vol. 3, ed. Hodgson, p. 66)The purpose of Religion, Philosophy, and human life itself, is to Elevate our finite spirit up to the level of Absolute Spirit. Hegel says: Spirit is Spirit only through consciousness, and the highest consciousness rests precisely with such knowledge. (Hegel, 1827, LPR vol. 3, ed. Hodgson, p. 439)Therefore, for Hegel, human consciousness is the vehicle by which this is accomplished. I should note here, furthermore, that Hegel was a Christian, and that Hegel regarded Christ as indispensable in this Elevation. ",

Everything you experience, even being hit with a football, are experiences within this personal consciousness. Even the consciousness that you assume in others. The evidence of material reality simply are experiences within this personal consciousness. What is god when you do not even fathom the depth of oneself, one\u2019s own consciousness? The next 300 years is very interesting for us humans, 3d printed organs first, then we will reach immortality, and then we will have a better understanding of time, space, bliss and consciousness. So consciousness is the final frontier. We are almost there. Thanks for reading. ",

They seven level thinking can be merged into a single level instinctive thinking, Which we call Brahman. Thus, human consciousness itself is god even though it has other entities in it. ",
