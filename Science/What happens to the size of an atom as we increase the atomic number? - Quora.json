            "answer_text": "Short answer: The general trend is that atomic size decreases as you move right across a single period (row), but increases if you move down a single group (column). Long answer: Each successive period (row) marks the beginning of a new principle quantum number (energy level), i.e., n increases by one for each row you move down. So the atom size increases as you move down the table, because electrons occupy higher energy levels further from the nucleus.* However, moving right within the same quantum level (period/row), increases the number of protons pulling the electrons in towards the nucleus. So, atomic size decreases as the number of protons increases within the same row (energy level), despite there being a larger number of electrons, as the electrons are more tightly bound. *This is a general trend. However, the transition elements in d-/f-block in each row/period actually fill orbitals of the previous energy level. I.e., in period (row) 4, the d-block is actually filling the d-orbitals of energy level 3. One example is Iron (Fe). The explanation for that belongs in a different question. :) ",
