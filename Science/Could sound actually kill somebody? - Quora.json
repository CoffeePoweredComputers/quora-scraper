            "answer_text": "In theory more than anything but yes. If you have prior unrestricted access to what ever the target happens to be to could determine its resonate frequency and then if you ignore environmental conditions it does not take a lot effort to excite it to the point of damage. But that is only way because the timing, amplitude, frequency all have to be perfect to the point of being impossible to predict this effect has only been seen in the real world by unpredictable \u201cperfect\u201d accidents (i.e. the Golden Gate bride undulating during an the \u201cbig one\u201d). As the other posters have mentioned because sound is a pressure force traveling through a medium (in this case our atmosphere) it will be altered from the state we sent it. The conditions are such precise that there is no room for error to achieve the desired result. But yes sound has the potential if all conditions can be met. Interestingly the human body is quite capable of handling high decibels with out permanent damage and it is actually distortion of the sound both acoustically and electrically that does permanent damage to our hearing and can quite quickly and with out need for extreme decibel. What happens with extremely high decibel levels of distortion free sound, such that is produced by the LORAD, is more of extreme disorientation and comfort which is what makes it extremely effective at non-destructively removing someone from a place you wish them not to be.

            "answer_text": "Can sound kill somebody is a better phasing. The answer is yes, as the other two respondents have indicated. It is not possible at present to generate a steady-state sound of adequate intensity, but shock waves can be generated by some weapons and by nature of sufficient intensity to do so. That\u2019s for an instantaneous kill. High noise levels can also cause hypertension and other disorders that can contribute to poor health and death. Further, there is vibroacoustic disease caused by prolonged exposure to vibration and noise that can contribute to ill health and weakened immune systems. Most recently, those exposed to blade-passage noise from windmills are reporting all sorts of health consequences and the exposure effects are worse indoors than out of doors. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, yes. Let\u2019s focus on decibels, the measure of sound of its frequency. If it were 166 dB, it could make your breathing weird and kill you. Going too high, such as 240 decibels, could actually explode your head. There\u2019s actually a piece of technology that can make sound noticeable even from 2 km (around 2 miles). It is called LRAD, and it can go up to 162 dB, potentially messing up hearing and actually make you feel pain. It is possible. If you could boost it up some more, it could most likely blast you due to the vibrations it gives off. Yes, you can kill or damage people with sound. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. At the highest decibel possible, 194 decibels, sound actually starts creating vacuums in the rarefaction portion of the sound wave.  At significantly lower decibel levels such as 85 for 8 hours a day, hearing loss can be suffered. 140 dB can permanently damage hearing in a sudden shock. 194 dB will likely cause significant breathing problems, lead to organ failure, and overall would probably be fatal.
