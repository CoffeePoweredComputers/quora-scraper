            "answer_text": "In most cases, magic, whether good or ill intentioned, doesn\u2019t \u201cwear off\u201d. Whether or not it expires is based on a number of factors, including the specific spell used, the intention of the caster, the strength of the magic, whether and how quickly it does what it\u2019s supposed to do, etc. Let\u2019s say someone cast a spell to break up your current relationship. In that case, the day you two broke up would mark the end of the spell. The magic wouldn\u2019t continue to follow you since the work would\u2019ve been done. However, if someone cast a spell to break up all your relationships, and leave you forever alone, it would continue to come after you time and again, because the work was unfinished. The results of the magic are also affected by the strength of the caster\u2019s feelings. Let\u2019s say your ex cast this spell. If he or she is angry but ambivalent, or new to magic, the spell would probably die before it got far enough to accomplish anything. However, if your ex was full of carefully honed and focused hatred, and had the experience to create a powerful curse, it could yield lifelong results. Instead of waiting for black magic to give up, I suggest meeting it directly. There are many people who can break spells. There are also protective spells and other resources, like amulets, that can mediate and offer protection from the dark magic. The best remedy, of course, is to make peace with the one who cursed you. Change their heart and they\u2019ll no longer have the concentration or emotion to sustain the magic they\u2019ve put into place. ",

            "answer_text": "Once again, MAGICK HAS NO COLOR. It\u2019s a tool. Use it for ill or good, but it is COLORLESS. Turn off the computer games and come out of the basement. Crack open a book and LEARN about it. As for \u201c\u2026how long it takes to wear off\u2026\u201d NOTHING IS PERMANENT. EVER. Not the ground under your feet. (The tectonic plates are in constant motion) Not the Earth you\u2019re on. (It\u2019s spinning) Not the planet you\u2019re inhabiting. (It\u2019s in orbit) Not the solar system you\u2019re in. (It\u2019s expanding) Anyone who tells you otherwise is a delusional grifter. The magick ends when the effect is obtained. \u201cI want him to love me!\u201d He stops by for a chat and you can then see if you two are a good fit. BANG! Spell is done. It really is that simple. And, NO there are no compound rituals. \u201cI want you to lose your job and always be alone \u201d Nope. Not only would the universe stop something like that, for your own good, but even if such a thing existed then you\u2019d burn out like a match. Why? Because there is a power exchange. Magick isn\u2019t free. That\u2019s why actual practitioners are very careful when and how they use it and why many have physical ailments in some form. Movement of any kind, including change requires energy. THERE IS A COST. (BTW, there\u2019s also no such thing as a \u201ccaster.\u201d Mage, witch, or priest/ess since we are talking about either 1. a religion or 2. an area of study.) Magick requires actual logic and thought. Otherwise it\u2019s \u201cwishcraft\u201d at best. One who uses magick is NOT a god. Beware the Unwashed masses who will give you that suggestion, or the terrified who will believe it. ",
