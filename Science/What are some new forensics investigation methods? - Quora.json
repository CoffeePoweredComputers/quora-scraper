It is the systematic process of identifying, collecting, preserving and evaluating information for purpose of bringing a criminal , Crime Trends and Criminal Justice offender to justice. In the present age, the hi-tech crimes are committed by the offenders. Every offender or law breaker is aware of various aspects of investigation through internet, newspapers, news channels and TV programs on crimes and tries to disguise his identity New techniques of committing crimes are used by the criminals to accomplish criminal designs. hence, to deal with such crimes, the law enforcement should adapt advanced investigation techniques, Scientific aid is an important tool to assist the Criminal justice delivery system. Scientific aids to investigation provide general as well as specific technical information on different aids to detection and investigation of crime, some of the recent advancements are; Narco-Analysis Test; Narco-Analysis is a process whereby a subject is put to sleep or put into semi-somnolent state by means of chemical injection and was then interrogated while in this dream like state, or the process of injecting a \u2018truth serum \u2018drug into a patient /suspect to induce semi consciousness, and then interrogating the patient /suspect .This process has been utilized to enhance the memory of a witness.Polygraph or Lie Detector Test; The principle behind the test is that the suspect fears detection of his/her lie and creates in him/her an emotion of fear which consequently results in psychological changes which are captured by different instrument.Brain Mapping or P300 Test; This technique is also known as \u2018Brain wave finger printing\u2019. In this technique, the suspect is first interviewed and interrogated to find out whether he is concealing any important information.DNA Profiling; One of the latest growing and most reliable modes of investigation in forensic science is DNA profiling. DNA is the abbreviation of the term, \u201cDeoxyribose Nucleic Acid\u201d. It is an organic substance which is found in every living cell and which gives an individual genetic blue print. DNA can be obtained from a wide variety of sources like, blood, semen, bone, saliva etc.Brain fingerprinting; Brain Fingerprinting is yet another latest innovative computer technology to recognize the criminal accurately and scientifically by measuring brain-wave responses to crime-relevant words or pictures presented on a computer screen. Brain Fingerprinting has proven 100% accurate.Ballistic Fingerprinting; Ballistic fingerprinting is one of the important branch of Forensic Science. It is another type of evidence. In ballistic Fingerprinting the distinctive marking left on ammunition as a result of its use in a specific weaponBinocular for identifying Dangerous gases; It is a device, which is known as poly-chromatic, is developed to spot and identify gases from two miles away when attached to binoculars. The system works by identifying the holographic signature of gases using infrared light to build up a 3- dimentional pattern of the composition of the gas.Remote personal assessment; It is a convert technique of forensic Science. It uses microwaves or lasers to assess the stress on the person remotely, covertly.Psycho-linguistic profile; It is a profile of a criminal based upon his written and spoken words and texts used by the criminal. Competent Forensic Psychologist can draw a fairly accurate descriptions of the possible criminal from the written or spoken (or both) words.Criminal Profiling; It is criminal\u2019s profiling based on his action and behavior. His acts, behavior, mannerism and expressions are used to construct his profile.Psychological Stress evaluator; It uses a voice spectrograph to study changes in vibration in the subsonic sound. Waves under interrogative stress when the subject tells lie in answer to the question, to find the truthForensic Acoustics- Speaker identification; Like variation in the face, fingerprint, and other biological parameters are discernible from one person to another, the voice also differs from one person to another. Voice analysis is essentially a sound spectrograph based technique, which is used to compare the recorded voice of an unknown individual to a known recorded voice sample of a suspected kidnapper, extortionist, terrorist, and others who communicate their intent to commit violent acts. The rate at which the globe has progressed is commendable. Advance technology has given the World an effective and precise tool for the purpose of criminal investigation. Presently forensic science plays vital role in crime and criminal detection. There are various techniques relating with the important role in detection of crime. DNA Profiling, Brain fingerprinting, Brain Mapping, Narco-Analysis, Polygraph test, Forensic photography etc. are the important techniques in the field of forensic science which play pivotal role in criminal investigation to find out the crime and criminals. At today the investigating authority are employing these effective modern techniques in solving the crime problems. source: shodhganga ",
