            "answer_text": "Well, sure, you can spend several years in college doing that\u2026 More seriously, it is a bit beyond the level of what can be accomplished in a Quora answer. For one thing, there isn\u2019t really one single definitive set of rules. The most \u2018official\u2019 rules for names of chemical compounds are promulgated by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). So you will see them referred to as \u2018IUPAC names\u2019 or \u2018IUPAC nomenclature\u2019. These rules are pretty good for your more simple and basic compounds, and are the most common names you will encounter for those, mostly (at least amongst chemists). However, IUPAC names, particularly for organic compounds, rapidly become unwieldy. So they aren\u2019t really usable for anything with more than maybe about 20 carbons. What you start to get are either traditional names or mixed names where some elements of IUPAC conventions get combined with other things. Plus a lot of useful organics had traditional names long before IUPAC, and those are quite common in everyday use. In many cases IUPAC simply adopted parts of those, so \u2018benze\u2019 as a prefix refers to an aromatic hydrocarbon ring (6 carbons linked in a hexagonal ring with 3 double bonds and 3 single bonds, called benzene with no other side chains). Technically there is some long mouth-breaking IUPAC name you could create from their rules for a benzene ring, but even IUPAC won\u2019t use that\u2026 Anyway, most inorganic compounds consist of a couple of ligands, that is they are something like a salt, say NaCl, we just name it for the positive and then the negative ion. Maybe one ligand is a complex, CaCO3, where CO3 is \u2018carbonate\u2019, so Calcium Carbonate. For these complexes you just have to know what their names are, though they are usually suggestive of the elements in them (Nitrate is NO3-, Chlorate is ClO3-, etc.). IUPAC and most informal names agree here, but there are traditional names for most of these (CaCO3, calcium carbonate is lime for example). There are also traditions in naming, NaHCO3 is \u2018Sodium Bicarbonate\u2019 to most chemists, but Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate is the IUPAC name (and baking soda is the traditional name). This is just scratching the surface, but this naming is generally pretty consistent. Still, it is a system that just has to be learned because names are inherently a bit arbitrary, someone made them up at some point! Now, with organic chemistry the system is a bit more logical to start with, alkanes (straight chain fully saturated hydrocarbons) names are really just based on numbers, and then different modifiers get added based on common side groups or substitutions. Even here though there are a lot of traditional names, the IUPAC name for CH3COOH is ethanoic acid, but it is virtually always known as acetic acid (vinegar) even by most chemists. This is for historical reasons, \u2018acetic\u2019 is just latin for \u2018acidic\u2019. I think this is enough to give you an idea of what the topic is like, even professional chemists are unlikely to know exactly what \u2018chlorofloroquine\u2019 is unless they go look it up, or it happens to be relevant to their work, though they will all understand it is an organic compound with chlorine and fluorine in it. I couldn\u2019t draw it off the top of my head, but I recognize \u2018quine\u2019 as a root indicating a fairly common small organic molecule that IIRC can be extracted from plants (IE quinine). So it is training and experience over time, but do look up the IUPAC nomenclature entry in Wikipedia, because that is a very good place to start. Preferred IUPAC name - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "Naming the compounds is particular branch of chemistry \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.one can write dozen of books on the rules of nomenclature. here I am discussing some of introductory rules may help you to name simple compounds. you can name chemical compounds if you know name of the ions and cations and formula also.\u2026..(inorganic simple ionic compounds.).  you can name substances if you know the chemical formula (contributing ions in the substance). 1st write the positive ion and then negative ion. for example for table salt it is sodium chloride. similarly you can name Na2SO4 as sodium sulfate or sodium sulfate. If there are more than one ions you can name like this (you can use prefixes before the name of that ion).. you have to know the name of ions and their combination gives you a clue about the names. for example magnesium dichloride or magnesium chloride.  an other example (sodium oxide or disodium oxide because it has two sodium)  more examples aluminium trichloride because it has three chlorine atoms.  carbon tetra chloride (tetra means four)  phosphorus penta chloride (5 chlorine atoms penta word is used.)  xenon hexafluoride (hexa means six)  similarly you can name other compounds\u2026 hope this help. I am sorry its too lengthy but I tried to help you\u2026\u2026.. and if you have further problems in naming compounds you can ask freely. Thank you. ",
