            "answer_text": "The size difference is actually MUCH, MUCH greater than you state. All elements are different, but the diameter of the nucleus (where all the protons and neutrons are located) of a typical atom is about 1/100,000 the diameter of the atom. There is no hard shell or physical boundary around an atom, but is instead merely a region where its electronic influence stops and where other atoms don\u2019t penetrate (unless a new bond is forming). Being 3 dimensional, the nucleus is really about 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 the volume of the atom! We can measure the size of the nucleus, but electrons are so small that we can not measure their size yet. So, the atom really is 99.9999999999999% empty space. Now that\u2019s not to say that things can easily penetrate that empty space, because the electrons produce an electric field that prevents outside matter from easily penetrating that space. But, yes, atoms are mostly empty space. Now you can understand why matter can compact into extremely dense neutron stars. ",

            "answer_text": "The 1% is the nucleus (neutrons and protons) and the electrons (which have virtually no mass compared to the neutrons or protons). People say atom is 99% empty because of the distance between the nucleus and the electrons. Take Hydrogen for example for its simplicity. It has 1 Proton in its nucleus/center. It also has 1 electron \u201corbiting\u201d it. Imagine this tiny proton was now the size of a basketball. The electron would now be found at any given point about 2 miles away from this basketball. That is the vastness of space between the nucleus and the electron, when thinking about it in units that we can comprehend. this is why people say an atom is 99% \u201cempty.\u201d ",
