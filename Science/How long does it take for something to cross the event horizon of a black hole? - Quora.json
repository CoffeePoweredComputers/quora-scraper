            "answer_text": "Time for me to recycle a previous answer to a different question. :) Aniko is right about two observers:  the far-away observer and the free-falling observer.  The far-away observer measures a freely-falling object's velocity to tend to zero as it approaches the horizon.  The freely-falling object doesn't notice anything strange... it will reach (and cross) the event horizon in finite time. There's another observer that's easy to discuss:  a \"stationary\" observer just outside the event horizon.  Imagine there's a space station or something that's stationary above the event horizon.  (I would have liked to have said it's in orbit, but technically, there aren't any stable orbits this close to the event horizon.  So let's just say it's firing super-powerful rockets like crazy, so that it can maintain a small distance from the event horizon.) This is an even weirder reference frame than the far away observer or the free-faller.  For this observer, anything that free-falls through the event horizon does so at just under the speed of light.   Imagine standing on the floor of such a space station, and you accidentally drop a penny.  By the time it hits the ground, it's going almost the speed of light in your reference frame.  (But in its reference frame, it might only be going a meter per second.) In all this, I think the takeaway is that \"velocity\" isn't a very useful concept in general relativity. ",

            "answer_text": "The length of time depends on your relative perspective. I'd advise you not to take me too seriously, considering I haven't even finished high school, but I've read that as you view an object getting closer and closer to a black hole, there is an effective time dilation due to the incredible gravitational field that would make time appear to slow down. The gravitational time dilation would increase as the object drew nearer, so you'd have something of an asymptotic progression going on (getting infinitely close to something but never reaching it).  To an outside observer, the amount of time would approach infinity. From the object's perspective, however, it would probably be a matter of seconds depending on the mass of the object. ",
