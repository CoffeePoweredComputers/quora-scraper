            "answer_text": " The train is accelerating. That means that at t1 (time 1) it is traveling at a certain speed, and at t2 it is traveling faster. t1 is the top image The man is in the train, which is traveling at velocity-1, call it v1. According to Newton\u2019s first law, if the train was in uniform motion (not accelerating), then the front of the train would expect to have moved a certain distance, from A\u2019 to B\u2019 during a certain time, t. Under those circumstances, the man, who is also subject to Newton\u2019s first law, would expect to have moved the same distance, from A to B, as in the second image, continuing is his state of motion unless acted upon by a force. However, the train is accelerating, and instead of moving to B\u2019, it has moved to B\u2019\u2019 This means that the man will have experienced the back of the train catching up with him, as shown by the left-hand image of the man in the bottom image, where he is positioned where he expected to be under uniform motion, without any force to change his uniform motion. This means that if he is to reach the right-hand position (which he must, if he is to keep up with the train), then something must provide a force against him to accelerate him also. That force would most likely to supplied by the back of his seat. ",
