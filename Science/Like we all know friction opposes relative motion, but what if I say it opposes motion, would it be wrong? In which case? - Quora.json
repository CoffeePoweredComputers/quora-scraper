            "answer_text": "Actually friction opposes relative motion at the point of contact. It would be wrong to say friction opposes motion, say in examples like a ball rolling when . Here the direction of friction is such that it adds a force in the direction of motion of the ball (but reduced the balls rpm) It is also not true for simple case of an accelerating car or a walking human. In these cases, friction force is actually the external force that is causing the motion. We induce such an external frictional force to propel us by moving the legs or tires backwards at relative point of contact. ",
