            "answer_text": "Most carbon atoms (C) have an atomic weight of 12 (6 protons, 6 neutrons). For the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s ignore the radioactive isotope of carbon (C-14) which has two additional neutrons in its nucleus. Nitrogen atoms (N) have an atomic weight of 14 (7 protons, 7 neutrons). Oxygen atoms (O) have an atomic weight of 16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons). Carbon dioxide (CO2) has a molecular weight of 12 + 16 + 16 = 44 grams per mole. Nitrogen (N2) has a molecular weight of 14 + 14 = 28 grams per mole. Oxygen (O2) has a molecular weight of 16 + 16 = 32 grams per mole. Given the same atmospheric conditions (same temperature and same pressure), carbon dioxide is 44/32 = 1.375 times as dense as oxygen and 1.571 times as dense as nitrogen. If a mass of pure carbon dioxide is released into the air (which is about 78% N2, 21% O2, and 1% Argon), it will sink to ground-level (or below ground-level if it encounters a hole) because it is more dense than the surrounding air. The pure mass of CO2 gas will sink through the air just like a lump of coal (with a density of roughly 1.4 grams/cc) will sink to the bottom of a glass of water. Given enough time, the CO2 will eventually mix with the air due to random thermal motion of the gas molecules, but this mixing could take quite a long time if a large mass of CO2 is \u201cpoured\u201d into a deep hole with a narrow opening. (The only place any significant mixing would occur would be at/near the boundary between the CO2 mass and the air, and if the CO2 is contained inside a hole, the boundary would be quite stable.) Any unfortunate persons at the bottom of the hole would quickly suffocate unless they realized what was going on and immediately escaped the hole or had an oxygen supply handy. Suffocation by CO2 can easily be confused with sudden drowsiness and go undetected long enough to render everyone unconscious (and within just a few minutes, dead). ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn't. Well, it does, but the difference between the concentration of CO2 and oxygen only becomes noticeable at HUGE scales; think considerable-fraction-of-the-height-of-the-atmosphere huge. In your scenario about being killed by CO2 settling at the bottom of a hole, don't worry : suffocation won't kill you. How do I know? Because if the hole is deep enough for atmospheric co2 to settle out to a lethal concentration at the bottom, it's also deep enough for the increasing pressure and pressure gradient to kill you well before you ever reach the bottom, especially if you descend too quickly. So unless we're talking scale-of-the-atmosphere, don't worry about CO2 settling below O2. ",
