            "answer_text": "Ions are formed when an atom\u2019s count of negatively charged electrons is disrupted from any number other than equal with its count of positively charged protons. This disruption, resulting in either a deficiency or surplus of electrons, can be caused by intense heat, nuclear radiation, high energy photons, proximity to or bombardment by other ions, or high potential difference electrical fields. Neon signs, florescent lights, plasma globes, and plasma cutters are good examples of ionization due to high voltage and the Aurora Borealis exemplifies ionization via interaction with external high-velocity ions.

            "answer_text": "Ions are formed when a chemical element, for example sodium (Na), gains or losses electrons. If an element gains electrons it will have more negative charges than positive charges and it is called an anion. When an element losses electrons it will have more positive charges than negative charges and it is called a cation. They are formed when an element is participating in an ionic bond. ",
