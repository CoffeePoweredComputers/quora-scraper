            "answer_text": "That's molten sodium chloride(liquid phase) containing mobile Na+ & Cl- ions (charge carriers) obtained by breaking the lattice by heat & thus it is good conductor of electricity. In contrast, Solid NaCl contains closely packed lattice of alternate Na+ & Cl- each having a coordination no of 6 i.e. each cation is surrounded by 6 anions & vice versa. Thus there are no free charge carriers, hence it is non conductor of electricity. ",
