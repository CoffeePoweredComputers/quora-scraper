            "answer_text": "There are some special numbers in nuclear physics called \"magic numbers\" (like the electronic shell number 8: a valence shell with 8 electrons is more stable than other configurations, and noble gases are more stable than other elements because of that). Lead-208 is a doubly magic isotope: 82 protons and 126 neutrons. Because of this double magic number, lead is specially stable. After lead in the periodic table, the growing instability of heavier nuclei isn't offset even by this magic number qualities, and thus instability grows with few exceptions. ",
