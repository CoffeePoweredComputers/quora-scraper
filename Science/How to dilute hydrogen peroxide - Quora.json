            "answer_text": "Carefully! Actually most hydrogen peroxide that consumers have access to is not a concern. The standard stuff is typically 3 to 10 percent dilute already and the manufacturer adds a stabilizer to it to prevent it from decomposing. This includes the normal bleaching peroxide that women use to make their hair blond. The peroxide you find in first aid kits is even more dilute (3% or lower). If you have the standard low concentration stabilized H2O2 you bought from a pharmacy or supermarket, that compound is safe. It is completely miscible (able to be mixed) with water. It is better to add it to water than add water to it. After adding peroxide to water, stir it with a chop stick, glass rod, or a long plastic spoon (no metallic spoon) and that is it, it is diluted. Now take special care if you have the industrial stuff (30% strength or more). You need to add a bit of acidity to it to keep it from rapid decomposition. Also add it to water very slowly and stir often. Also rather important wear a pair of goggles to protect your eyes. That said, the strong stuff does magic with body hair. The dilute stuff takes housewives couple hours or more to lighten their hair color. I have seen the strong stuff used to completely discolor women facial hair in seconds using a Q-tip. I do not recommend it though. It is rather dangerous. ",

            "answer_text": "My 90th answer! Please do Upvote. Anyways, a dilute solution is one in which the water potential is much higher. Remember such as dilute and concentrated are always relative to something, maybe another solution, or even the external environment. PROCEDURE FOR DILUTION; Example Scenario 1: We have a solution comprise of 90ml of H2O2, and 10ml of H20. Step 1; We pour out some of the solution, say 20ml. It is important to keep a note of how much we poured out exactly. Step 2; We must maintain the original total amount of fluid. In the original solution we had 90ml of H2O2 + 10ml of H2O = 100ml of Hydrogen Peroxide solution. 100ml of same, minus 20ml ( see. Step 1 ), equals 80ml of solution. As mentioned before, the solution is diluted by adding water, thus to increase the 80ml of solution to 100ml, we add 20ml of water. Step 3; We continue this process until the desired concentration per dm^3 of solution has been achieved. NOTE :- This process can be replicated for dilution of any soluble substance, in solution. For increasing concentration, we just change the procedure slightly, and instead of adding water to maintain total amount of solution, we add the solute of the solution, thus increasing it concentration per dm^3 of solution. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Usually, the \u2018safe\u2019 percentages of concentration for H2O2 are 3%, 10% or 35% at most (depending on what you are going to use it for). There is a formula for diluting any solution. Keep in mind that I will be explaining a simple dilution rather than a successive/serial dilution. The formula is: CxV=CxV Where: C is the concentration of the original solution in mol/dm^3V is the volume of the original solution in dm^3C is the concentration of the diluted solution in mol/dm^3V is the volume of the diluted solution in dm^3All you have to do is work out the math and apply it in real life in order to dilute your solution. I will save you the effort of converting percentages into mol/dm^3 and attach a link of a concentration calculator following this paragraph. CONCENTRATION CALCULATOR ",
