            "answer_text": "The photon is a packet of vibrating energy, that is a wave. When we strike a guitar, the vibrating string transmits a wave. The string definitely remains on the guitar - no material is emitted. Similarly, when an atom of hydrogen emits a photon, what happens is the electron, which is comparable to a spring under tension, suddenly snaps, losing an amount of energy that was accumulated. Like a spring or a string of a guitar, the electron vibrates a few cycles at a frequency that corresponds to the energy it released. Similar to music instruments, the electron can only produce a few specific frequencies. When the same hydrogen atom is chemically bound to other atoms, such as the case of H2O, the electrical attraction detunes the natural frequency of the electron, so the spectral lines of H2O are quite different than hydrogen alone or oxygen alone. An atom or material that absorbs any photon (of visible light), no matter the frequency, will appear black. The materials which don\u2019t absorb any photons are white, or metallic like mirror. Finally, glass is transparent because it neither absorbs nor reflects the photons in a wide range of frequencies. An atom of hydrogen can only absorb photons that are exactly matching one of the spectral lines. All other photons go through hydrogen as if there was nothing there, just an empty vacuum. In other words, hydrogen is transparent for most photons (of visible light). For the musical instrument analogy, it is as if a sound wave emitted by a specific guitar string could only excite the same string from a guitar at some distance, which makes sense (see coupled oscillators). A difference, however, is that when a guitar string would catch the vibration, it would absorb it completely, so that another guitar a few meter away would not detect that wave. Brief, the analogy between sound wave and photon is incomplete or misleading. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, there really is no way to provide a satisfactory answer to this question if you think of photons and atoms (or electrons) as \"particles\". Indeed, this is one of the motivations behind the development in quantum field theory. In quantum field theory, specifically in quantum electrodynamics, there are two fields: the electron field and the photon field. These fields are present everywhere. Like strings in a guitar, these fields can oscillate. Unlike strings in a guitar, oscillations or excitations of the fields happen in discrete units. Every elementary excitation is a \"particle\", though it is not necessarily localized: the \"particle\" may have a precisely defined momentum but spread out over much of spacetime, or it may be highly localized but with a huge uncertainty in momentum. An interaction between two fields can cause a new excitation to be created, or an excitation can be absorbed. This we perceive as a particle being created or absorbed in an interaction with another. When a photon is absorbed by an electron, it is gone. Its energy, momentum and angular momentum are transferred to the electron. Or to be more precise, the energy, momentum and angular momentum associated with a specific excitation of the photon field vanishes, while at the same time the properties of a corresponding excitation of the electron field (which we perceive as an electron) change.

            "answer_text": "Ah, how very splendid, splendid :) As much as my intuition tells me, the first pattern is matter under illumination, and the second one is matter left \u201calone\u201d. The first pattern is what happens to a bunch of those green states when in illuminated with a different frequency, literally. You can also notice that \u201cmatter left alone\u201d has a negative frequency. It\u2019s just a presentation, not necessarily a thing I would find in nature at the moment. But I enjoy these. Analogies generated in Python, if you will.   Feel free to comment. It\u2019s just a concept. Backed by experimental observation of fitting photons to EMPs. EDIT: I\u2019ve added my comment to Fred Kuryllowicz \u2018s comment. The Dank and Sexy Kittens are born. The blue curve is (Jm)^2 or the spatial distribution of the end result of the computation between the green and the red curves, disregard the red on the left for now please. The green-right and red-right undergo mulitplication with AB*exp(phase)*sin(disturbance frequency). A is the number of photon counts in the cavity (n*Jm) in general, and B is the photon counts of the incoming radiation. The incoming photons disperse exponentially when hitting matter, thus effectively yielding the blue curve. We disregarded time and shown a perfect interaction between perfect optical states in a matrix that is laid out on the Riemann Zeta function (notice the strange heights of the red-right - I only found such patterns in Riemann\u2019s Zeta or X-Ray analisys, but I may be wrong as hell). The red-left curve is the FFT of the red right curve. It\u2019s a time representation of the interaction but I visualize it rather as a cross section with the wavefront. So having the curves explained and looking at the two patterns, you can notice one has negative frequency which would mean no light is shining on the particles, thus it\u2019s a nicely shaped Schrodinger\u2019s cat. Just a dank cat. It\u2019s a Dank Cat. And that Dank Cat can be applied a laser pointer - which makes it run in circles, literally  Thus a positive frequency in the upper curve, meaning that the Dank Cat is illuminated by a Sexy Cat, which has nice shapes. Sort of like so.  So in fact, there are two cats, and not one. There is the Dank Cat and the Sexy Cat. I would call the Dank Cat Schrodie, and the Sexy Cat Pretty I would very much appreciate your input on cats! :) ",

            "answer_text": "When I was in university and took a course in antenna theory, it made me wonder: how does an antenna absorb energy from an electromagnetic wave? I was especially inerested in the idea of a crystal radio, where you used the power from a distant transmitter to drive the little earphone and hear the music. How did the thin little piece of wire intercept enough energy from the radio wave to put energy into the speaker? And if you optimized everything, how much energy could you theoretically draw out from the wave? You ask how an atom absorbs \u201cphotons\u201d. Do you know how a crystal radio absorbs \u201cphotons\u201d? It seems to me that is the place you should start. And if you do, then you will realize that it\u2019s not helpful in the slightest to talk about \u201cphotons\u201d. You have to analyze it in terms of electromagnetic waves. Right now I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking: the crystal radio has nothing to do with how atoms absorb photons, so it\u2019s a waste of time to think in classical terms of waves and antennas. And I\u2019m quite sure that none of the people who have answered this question so far have ever really analyzed the question of the crystal radio. But I have. And I know exactly how that little wire removes energy from the incident wave. I can tell you that the atom works exactly the same way as the crystal radio. It is a purely classical field interaction, and it is not helpful in the slightest to think about it in terms of \u201cphotons\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Typically, the photon interacts with an electron, pushing it into a higher-energy energy state within (\"orbit\" \"around\") the overall system of the atom.  The photon's energy is now the electron's energy; the photon's angular momentum is now added to the electron's angular momentum. Roughly speaking, there are no other properties of the \"photon itself\" that are required to stick around by the laws of physics as we know them.  The number of photons in the universe can change with time: in fact, the behavior of electromagnetism depends on them constantly popping into and out of existence. How does this happen?  Well, we have equations for the evolution of quantum mechanical states, but I'm not sure it's possible to have more of a \"how\" than to say what the rules of the universe are that we've observed. ",
