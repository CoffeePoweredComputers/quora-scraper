            "answer_text": "With eustatic sea level changes (rise and fall) the depositional environments for sedimentary rocks also change. The geology of Florida is a perfect example of this. Florida is essentially an exposed carbonate shelf. In order for limestone to form you need an environment in which the zooplankton (foraminifera, who\u2019s shells comprise massive pelagic limestone) can thrive. This would be a shallow, warm water environment with little clastic sedimentary influence from rivers. Foraminifera thrive in waters such as these. As they die their shells collect on the sea floor and over time forms limestone. If sea level drops that depositional environment would move further offshore. Now the area that previously supported the foraminifera is a depositional environment that is characterized by estuaries, rivers and creeks. With this comes more clastic sediments and the formation of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. Should sea level rise again the shallow, warm waters that support the foraminifera would be prevalent and limestone would be deposited on top of the sandstone, siltstone and mudstone that the estuaries, rivers and creeks deposited. Within the geological time frame eustatic sea level changes are a regular occurrence. So the lithology of an area like Florida would have alternating beds of limestone and sandstone. Now the part groundwater has in the formation of sinkholes is considered. Both limestone and sandstone can be excellent aquifers where tremendous amounts of water can be held within the pore space between the grains of the rock. However limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) dissolves in the presence of acid. As precipitation falls on the surface and it leaches downward it picks up constituents from the atmosphere and decaying plant matter that make it a week carbonic acid. So over time the limestone will dissolve and create subterranean caverns and caves. The clastic sedimentary rocks like sandstone do not weather in this way and typically stay intact. So it\u2019s easy to see how a \u201cbridge\u201d of sandstone could very easily be over the top of one of these subterranean voids. Over time the sandstone becomes weak and will collapse in on these voids. This is exacerbated by the human development of buildings and streets which adds weight and vibration to these sandstone \u201cbridges\u201d. When it gives way, you get a sinkhole.    ",

            "answer_text": "Naturally forming Sink holes are normally found in lime stone areas. Water traveling under ground dissolves the limestone and forms an ever expanding done. There may be no sign of the underground hole on the surface. Eventually the void expands up until the ceiling is too weak to support it self and it falls into the void in a catistrophic failure. Sink holes in cities are also found in areas where there are leaks in water and sewer system pipes. Because of the leak soil is removed around the leak creating a growing dome like void and the dome continues to form until the surface collapses into the hole. There is normally little if any warning and suddenly the hole presents itself. ",
