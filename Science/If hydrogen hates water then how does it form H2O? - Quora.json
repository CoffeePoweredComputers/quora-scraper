            "answer_text": "What do you mean by hydrogen hates water. Hydrogen doesn't react with water that is all. To express in your language, hydrogen is in great love with oxygen and whenever it gets a chance it enters in strong wedlock with it to form water. You know electrolysis of water is a cheap and quick method to break their wedlock but comparatively it is modern. Otherwise to separate them in old days! Very difficult and costly procedure. Both of them obey perfectly their marriage oath. Separate them and see. As soon as they get a chance they embrace. When they come together and give birth to water none of those gases react with water. Hydrogen and oxygen neither hate water nor they love water. Both of them are happy with each other.

            "answer_text": "I think what you are trying to ask is: \u201cIf the solubility of hydrogen gas in water is so low, how can it form water?\u201d. The other answerers describe how elemental hydrogen bonds with elemental oxygen chemically to form water, but that has almost nothing to do with molecular hydrogen's or molecular oxygen's ability to dissolve in (not react with) water. This ability is small for these gases because they are non-polar, while water is polar, meaning it has a clearly defined positive and negative charge distribution. ",
