            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 that\u2019s it, you see. It cannot. It\u2019s a bit more subtle than that. Let me try to explain how it works. Though it is inspired by experiment (in particular, by observations that cannot be explained by classical physics alone) the basic process is mathematical. We take the equations that describe a classical particle (which always has a well-defined position, velocity, etc.) We do a little bit of algebra to these equations, messing them up if you wish. The resulting equations are still classical physics\u2026 however, they also have additional solutions that make absolutely no freaking sense in classical physics. We then make a leap of faith and declare that these solutions, too, describe the particle\u2019s reality. Did I say that these solutions make no freaking sense classically? I meant it. Which means, among other things, that most of the time, the particle has no classical properties. It has no classical position. No classical velocity. And so on. So no, it is not in different places simultaneously. Rather, it has no location at all in the classical sense. What it does have is a state. (This is that mathematical solution that I mentioned above.) And that state, together with a configuration of a measurement apparatus, tells you the probability of finding the particle at a given location, or traveling at a given velocity. When you actually make the measurement, you interact with the particle, and this will be one of those rare, fleeting moments when the particle actually has a position. When it has a position, it is always a single position; it is never in two places at once. But most of the time, the particle has no classical position at all, just a state that yields varying probabilities for the particle to be found at various places. This state can be represented as a superposition of all those possible locations, but it doesn\u2019t really mean that the particle is at all those places; what it means is that the particle may be found at any of those places once a measurement is being made.

            "answer_text": "Quite a variety of answers here, and some from very knowledgeable people. I\u2019m guessing that the person who asked the question was looking for an intuitive explanation which provides a physical picture: which can become difficult when operating at the boundaries of our our knowledge. Some answers simply say \u201cbecause the math says so\u201d: as per the reference to \u201cwave functions\u201d and \u201chigher dimensional vectors\u201d to describe the \u201cstate\u201d. At least the word \u201cstate\u201d has some sense of physical existence about it, but is still rather non-specific. Although technically correct, this approach does not provide a conceptual explanation but is merely an operational explanation: i.e., a description of an activity (highly skilled though that activity might be). It\u2019s akin to telling someone that computers work by pressing the keys in the correct sequence. Others say, that because of \u201ccomplimentarity\u201d each particle is also a wave: which is really just parroting a mantra and not providing an explanation. Some skeptics even dismiss quantum theory as a fraud - while typing on a computer whose working bits are constructed on the basis of the \u201cquantum rules\u201d. Such empty mud-slinging doesn\u2019t stick. Perhaps the most \u201cphysical\u201d approach, is to consider that reality consists of a superposition of fields (as per Prof. Brooks), which can have wavelike disturbances in them: which can \u201cyes\u201d have smeared-out locations. And when enough waves add together so that they cancel out at all but one location, the result is very short wavelet - that we now call a particle because it has the property of being localized: i.e. has minuscule dimensions compared to those of our instruments. But what exactly is a \u201cfield\u201d? Have we simply moved the goal posts? We might even say that the variety of answers and disputations, in regard to a very reasonable question, is evidence that Feynman was correct when he claimed that no one truly understands quantum mechanics. Like many here, I have lain awake at night with my mind spinning on this same question - and rightly or wrongly have come to a conclusion that, although still rather metaphysical, lets me sleep at night. :-) Be forewarned that, as far as I know, what comes next is not accepted physical theory or philosophy, but it does seem to be consistent with some widely held views. Reality Emerges from the Realm of Possibility There are rules of logic that exist outside space and time - and what we experience as reality is emergent from these rules. The rules define what is \u201cpossible\u201d and self-consistent, and govern what can emerge into reality. In regard to questions raised in Eugene Wigner\u2019s essay, http://links.uwaterloo.ca/amath731docs/wigner_unreasonable_effectiveness_1960.pdf, it is for this reason that mathematics is so unreasonably effective in the natural sciences. To come to the point, I think that reality emerges from the summation of possibilities. Clearly this resonates with Feynman\u2019s \u201csum over histories\u201d approach, where the likelihood of an event happening is defined by the number of ways in which it can happen. And so the interference pattern from the double slit experiment represents the summation of the two possible histories that could have placed each photon (which also had to pass through the slits on a parallel path) on the screen. I also see this as a variation of the second law of thermodynamics: but no need to go there at the moment. It can also be said that, within the realm of possibility, some things are \u201cmore possible\u201d than others, because (again) there are more ways they can occur. And, having some things \u201cmore possible\u201d than others equates to a probability distribution, or what we might call a \u201cfield of probability\u201d. And, therefore, what we call fields are zones of altered probability in space/time that some event (like a single photon becoming \u201clocalized\u201d on a screen) will occur. The mathematics we have developed to describe these fields of probability is what we call quantum field theory, which can be imagined as an operational interface between the realm of the \u201cpossible\u201d and the \u201cactual\u201d. As to why the probability distributions vary in wavelike fashion, I would guess that this allows for both smoothly varying changes along with the ability for probabilities to add up by constructive interference and cancel by destructive interference (to varying degrees). In this regard, a negative probability (although the correct terminology would be \u201cprobability amplitude\u201d) would be understood as the probability that the opposite thing happens: and when a thing and its opposite happen at the same time and place, they cancel and \u201cnothing happens.\u201d I have tried to capture the concept in the simple figure below. So, how is a particle in more places than one? Because before being measured as a particle (which by definition has a well defined location) it exists as a potentiality: a potentiality that can become a reality by interacting with the septillions of particles in our macroscopic detector.

            "answer_text": "Nooo.This confusion seems to have arised due to someone in the media having little knowledge of QM, and trying to portray QM in a way that we see everyday normal macroscopic things.The problem is that electrons aren't everyday, normal macroscopic objects.So, don't go trying to explain it with logic that you see works with macroscopic objects. This is why people call QM to be inherently counter-intuitive to understand at first. With objects at the size of the electron(even the size of the electron is a disputed thing, cause having a size means that it is a particle), all the laws of classical mechanics break down, And you must solve the Dirac equation for the electron's wave function (including both relativistic and non-relativistic cases) to get knowledge of : Probable Position of the electronProbable Momentum of the electronAlso, notice that I used the term \"electron wave function\" and \"probable\", and not just \"electron\" or \"position of electron\". This is because at the very small scale of objects, they are no more particles, but rather matter waves, and you cannot talk of the electrons as if they were some baseball with a known position and momentum. This is a consequence of de Broglie's wave-particle duality. And all the \"queer\" properties of quantum objects are a consequence of this wave-particle duality.Now coming to the question at hand, ask yourself this: Can a wave be at two places at the same time?  The resounding answer is: YES IT CAN.(In the above picture, for example, the wave is spread out along the string)You could have a wave pulse like this  Where if you were to use classical logic, you'd end up with the electron in not two, but 5 parts with equal probability of being at any of the 5 positions.The probability that an object will be at a particular position [math]x[/math] is [math]\\left | \\psi (x) \\right |^{2}[/math] , where [math]\\psi (x)[/math] is the wave function in position space ",

            "answer_text": "No! But a \u201cparticular\u201d essence will travel along all possible paths to get from one place to another. Let\u2019s say an electron came to be free at the tip of a lightning bolt. Then, mathematically some essence of the electron will travel to the moon and reflect off a mirror left by an astronaut, and return in time\u2026 The essence of that electron will boonsqwaggle hither and sway before emanating at it\u2019s next location. \u2026 It will travel to the kitchen, traverse your dog\u2019s skull, brain and eyeball and \u2026. It will rebound off the edge of the universe and return to it\u2019s next location in time. What is the electron\u2019s next location? Say it is the tip of your cat\u2019s tail. (The cat became positively charged because you rubbed it with a balloon.) So an electron that travels from the tip of a lightning bolt, spans the entire universe to get to the cat-tail at just the right time. How does it do that? It does this in accordance with Quantum Mechanics. The electron (a particle) is a disturbance in a field. The disturbance is a wave that propagates (like a water wave would from a pond when stuck by a pebble) in all directions in spacetime. The wave bounces and rebounds off all aspects of the entire universe and coalesces, as waves do, by superposing themselves\u2026 on the cat-tail. It is NOT fair to say that the electron (particle) exists in the universe between it\u2019s creation by the lightning bolt and it\u2019s moment of capture by the balloon. Instead what \u201cexists\u201d is an abstract wave. This abstract wave in the abstract field of electronness is a mathematical expression. The actual particle \u2014- the ELECTRON \u2014- exists ONLY in two spots: The tip of the lightning bolt and the tip of the cat tail. DO NOT discriminate between particles. There are many particles in the universe and they all behave like this. When you get from your bed to work, you too take all possible paths in the universe. Same goes for a photon, a proton, an internet message, a careening baseball over the grass-strands.. or a frog leap spanning the pond. But if the particle is iddy biddy, it will be more wavelike in it\u2019s travels so we can surmise that it is subject to the laws of Quantum Mechanics. Still, rest assured everything is Quantum Mechanical but massive things like geese \u201caverage out\u201d to behaving like classical entities.. They squawk and flock \u00e0 la Newtonian dynamics in the sky So the answer to your question: \u201ccan a particle exist simultaneously in different places at the same time?\u201d is NO! A particle can not be in two different places at the same time, but a wave in the field instanting its existence always spans the entire universe. (I want to add, just for completeness, that the laws of Quantum Mechanics driving the electron from the lightning bolt to the cat tail must, of course, be constrained by the symmetries of General Relativity\u2026.)

            "answer_text": "There is absolutely no observational evidence that it can, and there is more nonsense written about this than you can believe. The problem is that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a wave equation that in some ways behaves like the \u201cwave equation\u201d of Hamilton in classical physics. The wave is described by a function \u03c8, and the question then is, what does \u03c8 mean? It has a classical wave phase term, except it is complex, and what it means has bedevilled physics ever since. The Copenhagen Interpretation argues that \u03c8.\u03c8*, where \u03c8* is the complex conjugate, gives the probability of finding the particle (or whatever) at the relevant coordinates. The dynamics gives clear signs of wave-like properties (diffraction, partial reflection, tunnelling) but whenever the particle is detected, it is detected at a very small location, and unlike waves, it is possible with a laser to send a photon on a very narrow path for a very great distance. The problem with this interpretation is that it is taken further than it should, at least in my opinion. Prior to observation, there may be various probabilities that occur in different places. Thus suppose you send one particle through the 2-slit experiment. It will have various probabilities of being in the various diffraction wings, but it only turns up at one place. So, what happens to the other probabilities? The problem is, for some reason it is believed that the particle was spread out over the whole wave pattern, then it collapses, but there is absolutely no evidence for that. There are claims that entanglement operates over huge distances, and this is true, but they are still two entangled particles. One of the problems is that some people seem to have a strange belief that all output son mathematics must occur. This is plainly untrue. Suppose I give you the kinetic energy of a train of known mass going along a line and ask you to calculate the velocity. Taking the square root gives two answers, but you do not expect to have one train going in two directions, or for that matter, two trains. One of the answers just does not happen.I believe the same happens with probabilities in quantum mechanics. When you make your observation, you get one answer. Prior to that, that is a matter of opinion, but there is no real evidence to support several \u201coptions\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "How can a particle exist simultaneously in different places at the same time? It is the core concept from wave particle duality, that a particle's position will spread out in time under the influence of a wave equation. When a particle diffracts, say after passing through a slit or hole, it spreads along a wavefront. Passing through multiple holes or slits (as in the double-slit experiment ) produces the same diffractive behaviour, and the single particle will pass through all the slits - i.e. be in many places at the same time, both at the slits and beyond. This is what a wave is, in wave particle duality, it is the particle simultaneously existing in different places. But when you measure where the particle is, you only find it at one point and there afterwards the other positions is might have been at are irrelevant (this is known as wave function collapse ). There are different ways of interpreting this. My preferred option is due to Hugh Everett. When you measure or observe the particle's position you get \"spread out\" as well, splitting into different time lines, in each of which you observe the particle in a different position. This is known as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. ",

            "answer_text": "Before addressing whether or not an electron (or other elementary particle) can be in two places at once, we should first ask whether it can even be in one place, i.e., what it really means to say a particle has a position. According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the position of a particle can never be determined with absolute precision because there is an inherent indeterminacy in its position. Thus, when a particle's position is measured, it does not have a single, definite position at all, but rather its position is described as a superposition of various positions (perhaps very localized, but nonetheless still a distribution). It is not that the particle has a definite position but we simply don't know it. Rather, its state is a simultaneous superposition of various position states. Thus, a particle never is in exactly one place. Insofar as it nevertheless still exists, we are thus forced to say that it is in some sense in several places at once. For example, the double slit experiment has been performed with individual particles, and has demonstrated that each particle goes through both slits simultaneously, and the superposed states (corresponding to the two slits) interfere with each other. The particle certainly existed in some sense as it passed through the double slit apparatus; yet because of the observed interference we can not say that it passed through just one slit or the other. Thus, it somehow passed through both slits simultaneously, i.e., was in two places at once. The superposed states, however, don't represent states of being in the common sense meaning of the term. As Heisenberg describes it, the quantum state is \"something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.\" The implication is that we can not accurately apply our usual concepts to the description of physical reality at the quantum level. Only the mathematics provides a precise and accurate description. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Like any other object in the universe, electrons can NOT be in two places at the same time. For a quantity, being in a superposition does not mean 1) having multiple values, 2) having one of the superposed values but we don't know which one. These two are common misconceptions about the concept of superposition. A superposition state contains the information about the occurrence probabilities of possible outcomes after a measurement. Say, in a many-slit experiment, the position state of an electron is a superposition of passing several slits. Using this information we can calculate with which probability it'll hit a certain location on the screen. The difference between regular probability theory and quantum superposition is that, in the classical probability an electron will pass through a certain slit but we don't know which one, hence we will assign probabilities to passing different slits. And to calculate the probability of it hitting the position x on the screen, p(x), we should add all the probabilities corresponding to possible paths, p(x) = p(x|A)*p(A)+p(x|B)*p(B)+... where the terms mean \"probability of hitting x after passing through the slit A\" times \"passing through the slit A in the first place\". In classical probability all these terms, all possible paths that'll reach the point x, will have a positive contribution in the total sum of the probability. Whereas the superposition allows negative contributions, which is counter intuitive. This means, if I open a new slit somewhere, it might decrease the possibility of hitting the point x on the screen! So, in no case the electron is split or cloned into two, or many copies. That would violate conservation of energy. ",

That\u2019s why Quantum Field Theory is the answer, and why I wrote my book to explain QFT to a lay audience without math (see quantum-field-theory.net). Here\u2019s a quote from my book: \u201cIn QFT there are no particles (stop me if you\u2019ve heard this before) and hence no position \u2013 certain or uncertain. Instead there are blobs of field that spread out over space. Instead of a particle that is either here or here or possibly there, we have a field that is here and here and there. Spreading out is something that only a field can do; a particle can\u2019t do it. Now there is a property of fields called Fourier\u2019s theorem that relates the spatial spread of a field to the spread of its wavelengths, and in QFT the wavelength of a quantum is related to its momentum. I still remember my moment of insight in graduate school when I realized that Heisenberg's relation between the uncertainties of position and momentum is nothing more than Fourier\u2019s theorem.\u201d Come on, everyone, it\u2019s time to WAKE UP AND SMELL THE FIELDS.

            "answer_text": "My original idea was to take quotes from each answer to show how disparate were the answers in themselves, there seems to be no consensus as to what is actually happening, but it might be considered as too intrusive. An intriguing aspect of all these answers is that NO a particle cannot be in two places at once is quoted side by side with YES, experimental results seem to inexplicably point to a particle being in two places at one and the same time. My apologies but this is not science or anywhere near science no matter how perfect the mathematics behind the probabilities might be. let's see what Dr. Richard Feynman has to say on the subject of light: \u201cFeynman explains that in QED light sources produce not physical particles or waves, but wavelike \u201cprobability amplitudes\u201d that propagate at c in space (not superluminally). The amplitudes spread in all directions and superpose (interfere) just as real light waves do according to the Huygens-Fresnel principle: by spherical wavelets from every portion of the wavefront. Feynman restates this principle as light \u201chas a nearly equal chance of going on any path\u201d. As they propagate in space, the probability amplitudes shrink according to the inverse square law and rotate in space according to their frequency (\u201cshrinks and turns\u201d). Adding up all the resultant arrows for all the possible paths light may travel to the receiver renders a final amplitude arrow. Squaring this arrow yields the probability that a detectable light-matter interaction will be observed. Where the probability amplitudes superpose constructively is where events (e.g. photomultiplier counts) are more likely to occur; where they superpose destructively is where events are less likely to occur. Feynman admits that the wave theory of light can account for all the phenomena modelled by QED when the light is intense; but insists that \u201cwave theory cannot explain how the (photomultiplier) detector makes equally loud clicks as the light gets dimmer.\u201d On this basis alone he rejects wave theory and concludes that \u201clight is made of particles.\u201d Fine Feynman's answer is exactly the same as all of the other answers given for this question at this forum so far. The point is you are missing the wood for the trees. Look at what Feynman says: The amplitudes spread in all directions and superpose (interfere) just as real light waves do according to the Huygens-Fresnel principle: by spherical wavelets from every portion of the wavefront. Feynman restates this principle as light \u201chas a nearly equal chance of going on any path\u201d. The point is that light actually behaves like this, it has a physical presence that follows the Huygens-Fresnel principle of spherical wavelets from every portion of the wave-front, isn't it possible to see that the quantum mechanics version of this description of wave propagation as a probability function takes the subject out of the realm of the real and into one of conjecture and one that is extremely badly phrased and imperfect conjecture at that. Feynman goes onto say: Feynman admits that the wave theory of light can account for all the phenomena modelled by QED when the light is intense; but insists that \u201cwave theory cannot explain how the (photomultiplier) detector makes equally loud clicks as the light gets dimmer.\u201d\\ To be Frank I do not see how a probability wave can ever be the same as the propagation of 'real' waves since it is largely fictional. Let me raise an even more serious objection to this theory of the wave function is described as follows: The wavefunction is not a material object. It is not a wavey process in 3 dimensional space. (as is seen as soon as you consider the wavefunction of two or more particles in the many body problem). It is a mathematical object in 3n dimensional configuration space where n is the number of interacting particles. It essentially contains all the statistical information about a system that it is possible to have- kind of like a giant list. If you make a measurement you effectively add a condition that the system obeys so reducing the possibilities and so you are now considering a subset of the original list. This is what the collapse of the wavefunction is. This is why a measurement can collapse the wavefunction everywhere instantaneously rather than propagating out from the measurement location at the speed of light as it would if the wavefunction were some sort of material thing. If you did not get that or have selective amnesia, let me tell you that the above passage states that the wave function does not even travel in 3 dimensional space. So how many dimensions does it travel in, it travels in 3n dimensions, that is for every particle (imagine the number of photons in a ray of light) there are 3 new dimensions. Knock yourself out, enjoy the mathematical beauty and intricacy of such a theory. MAY I advance a simpler theory ? Thank you , here goes:With the coming of Quantum Mechanics the Double Slit experiment was refined to allow for individual photons to pass through the slits, an amazing phenomenon was seen. When both slits were open even though the \u2019single\u2019 photon would have to pass through one of the slits, over time an interference pattern was built up. When only one slit was open a diffraction pattern was built up over time. This seemed to imply that (a) either the photon knew that the other slit was open OR (b) the photon itself split up and followed multiple paths in order to pass through both slits at once, both ideas support the wave like property of particles. The experiment was repeated using electrons, neutrons and alpha particles always with the same results, an interference pattern when both slits were open and a diffraction pattern when only one slit was open!  The question is, How did the photon in the first experiment know that the second slit was not open? Think about it. If both slits are open, there are always alternating bands of illuminated and dark areas. This means that there are always areas where the photons never go (otherwise there would not be any dark areas). If one of the slits is closed, there is no interference and the dark bands disappear; the whole wall becomes illuminated, including those areas which previously were dark when both slits were open. When we fired our photon and it went through the first slit, how did it \"know\" that it could go to an area that must be dark if the other slit were open? In other words, how did the photon know that the other slit was closed? \"The central mystery of quantum theory,\" wrote Henry Stapp, is 'How does information get around so quick How does the particle know that there are two slits? How does the information about what is happening everywhere else get collected to determine what is likely to happen here?\u201d There is no definitive answer to this question. Some physicists, like E. H. Walker, speculate that photons may be conscious! The experiment was repeated using successively more massive particles from electrons to protons to neutrons and even molecules always with the same result. Obviously to the proponents of Quantum Mechanics the Double Slit Experiment when conducted with sub-atomic particles was, apart from possessing other esoteric properties such as prescience and the ability to be in two places at once, the ultimate proof of wave particle duality. BUT hold on for detractors of Quantum Mechanics this experiment was the ultimate proof of something else. Look at the Diagram below:  In this version of the experiment it is assumed that an undetectable aether exists, undetectable to the human sense but very apparent to micro particles. Since the aether exists everywhere, and since according to neo-classical theory, it follows logically that when both slits are open that the aether will travel through both slits and manifest as an interference pattern. If single particles are now released they will follow as illustrated in the diagram above the path of the interference pattern created by the aether. When only one slit is open the aether will make a diffraction pattern and this is what the micro particles will show. Thus the Double Slit Experiment can be taken as the ultimate proof of the existence of an aether and should, considering the wild theories of QM be considered as such ! N.B. This is exactly the same aether that exists every time you turn on a light or switch on an electrical appliance. ",

From a quantum state of a particle you can extract the probability of locating it at various positions. When you locate the particle, it's position becomes certain. But it is not, that the particle is somewhere we don't know before measurement, because that would imply local hidden variables. \"What happens when the \u201cwavefunction collapses\u201d? It is tempting to suppose that this event is not a physical one but merely an updating of our knowledge of the system: that the system was already in the state |I\u27e9 before the measurement, but we only became aware of this fact when the measurement was made. It turns out that this interpretation is untenable, and that wavefunction collapse is associated with a real physical disturbance of the system.\" The Physics of Quantum Mechanics -James Binney and David Skinner The principle of superposition comes from the concept of waves, where different waves can pass through each other and continue undisturbed, but in quantum physics things are a bit different. A particle doesn't have a definite position until measured. You could say it is and entity spreadout to all those superpositions of locations, and when it is detected, a full quantum of the particle is detected at a particular location. Quantum mechanics gives a definite position after measurement but in reality you can never get an absolute position because the measurement apparatus can only be made of other particles. ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer this question for one last time: Quantum Mechanics is the most elaborate form of deception ever created in the \u201chard sciences\u201d. When Albert Einstein in the 1920s uncovered the obvious logical errors on the new developments of QM Erwin Schrodinger, in a successful act of desperation, found the solution: to mix physics with the irrebatible philosophy of David Hume and published a little book Science Theory and Man by Erwin Schroedinger, Schrodinger on Kuenzig Books that, studied carefully by physicists, set the stage for a comedy which last to these days. You will hear in this \u201cnew\u201d physics, assertions, such as \u201clittle clump of waves\u201d, which put you to work hard stirring BS concepts which sound meaningful but only lead to to work hard stirring BS concepts which sound meaningful and so on\u2026 See below for a typical example: The physical basis of Schrodinger's theory was this: Ordinarily, one can think of a particle as a dot; but one should really visualize it as a little clump of waves, a ''standing wave'' in today's parlance. Don't bother thinking of electrons as particles, Schrodinger said, and forget about this quantum-leap business. Just apply rules of wave interactions. Beyond constructing a mechanism for particle interactions, Schrodinger linked the quantum world of the microscopic to the classical world of macroscopic objects. Waves now existed, figuratively speaking, in atoms as well as in oceans. Physicists could understand waves, which they had endlessly studied. Schrodinger's wave mechanics saved quantum theory and at the same time threatened its underpinnings. It utilized continuous phenomena, waves, to explain the discontinuous quantum world of the atom.

            "answer_text": "It cannot. This phenomenon was hypothesized when it was discovered that particles in certain conditions, usually the very very small associated with quantum theory. This theory puts forth the idea that energy cannot have a continuous energy field. The double slit experiment with its interference patterns of light can only be explained by waves and thus a photon has to be in both slits to produce an interference pattern. Water waves show the same interference patterns. This idea has been used to explain why particles display interference patterns because the behave as waves as well as particles. Current quantum field theory states that fields are discontinuous. That means when a particle interacts with another atom it can only gain energy in quantum packets. This idea can be used to explain the interference patterns produced in molecular patterns interactions. The idea that a particle needs to be a wave and be in both places at the same to interfere is not accurate. The wave equation of a particle is simply a mathematical construct which calculates probabilities of particles. It does not mean the particle is a wave. Quantum fields explains how and why particles produce a wave phenomena. Particles cannot be in 2 places at the same time. ",

            "answer_text": "This is my theory First we look at these result of \u201cDouble Slit Experiment\":   If you look at the distribution of light, the middle are brighter than the rest, going more dim when it goes further left and right. Now look at my writings here:  Explanation: Light moves like a wave, a wave with lighspeed. When wave of one photon goes through two slits, in that lightspeed moment it doesn't choose which one to pass, instead it tries to pass both of the slits. The photon particle actually passes one of the slits, but it's vector are still doing both so when it goes up, the vector also goes down, when it goes right, the vector also goes left. Resulting in a bit curved path. The more left/up the photon goes, the more right/down the vector goes. But the distribution is not random (or all over the screen), the wave-like pathway of photon help makes the track divided regionally. My writings show 5 region of possible ending (A B C D E), and 6 possibilities of how the photon passes those two slits (a b c d e f). After some calculation it shows that the possibilities of photon landing on point C is higher than landing to point B and D (B and D have the same possibilities). And photon landing on point B and D should be more often than to point A and E. Point C is the brightess, B and D in the middle brightness, A and E are the lowest. The calculation matched with the result of the experiment shown above. So my conclusion is, the particle is NOT in two place at the same time, but somehow the particle goes different way than its \u201cmovement vector\u201d (I don't know what the right term for \u201cmovement vector\"), resulting in curvature pathway.

That is because at any moment you are observing a particular point on that disk there is a very high probability that.a solid blade is there the moment you are looking. If you poke your finger into the disk at any point at anytime you are going to pokea solid fan blade. If you poke two fingers at the same time two different places you are going to poke a solid fan blade. Because the probability of there not being a blade there when you poke your finger in and out is extremely low. It is as if the fan blades have spead themselves out through the entire disk. This is an anology for finding an electron. It has a very high probability of being anywhere within the shell of its energy level and you have no way of knowing where it is until you \"poke\" it. Then just like the fan blade where you poke it is where you find it. The big difference is that unlike the fan blade the electron isn't moving. It's just there. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem here, is using imprecise notions of measurement. Let's use an analagous example: a bat using echo location. A bat community decides to study this. A bat will send out a \u201clocator particle\" from its mouth, and detect it with its ears. It's known that the particles travel at a constant speed, and bounces off solid objects. The time it takes to emit the particle and detect it gives a good indication of what's ahead. It will even detect flying insects. That's what you learn happens in bat grade school, and will get you through life. In bat graduate school, you find out that it's not a \u201cparticle\" at all, but a high frequency sound wave, with a length of about 4mm. There is no such thing as knowing the \u201cposition\u201d of this sound with any greater precision. Or knowing \u201cwhen\u201d it was formed, to greater precision than it's frequency (about 80kHz). But to make it fit the \u201cparticle\" concept, we say that the locator particle has different probabilities of being found within the confines of this sound wave length and duration . Next semester, bat grad students find out that it's not quite a pure tone, but more a chirp, compromising of many pure tones superimposed. That's how a \u201clocator particle\u201d appears to be in many places at once: higher frequencies bounce off the flying moth two feet away, and lower ones bypass it and bounce off the tree three feet away. There is even a fundamental uncertainty principle: the lower the frequency, the less certain you are about a location. Higher frequencies take more energy, and are harder to produce. Then bats learn about gases: a community of bats all producing locator particles. They can\u2019t all create identical ones-- each needs it's own states. Else bats can't tell theirs from their neighbors. Now if you were a bat and never told about \u201cparticles\" then this is so much easier to grasp. But if you were never told about particles you'd have to learn wave mechanics and Fourier transforms, just to grab a moth. \u201cParticles\u201d works for the overwhelming vast majority of cases you'd need to know about electrons and protons. There are of course many differences between fermions/ bosons, and sound waves. But at an intuitive level, the analogy is accurate enough. ",

            "answer_text": "The Multiverse interpretation of Quantum Mechanics may explain particle/wave superposition. \u201cSuperposition\u201d means the photon is simultaneously a particle and a wave. It goes like this. There are parallel universes, meaning universes in which a given photon in our universe has identical counterparts. \u201cParallel\u201d photons may interfere with one another. The classical Double Slit Experiment demonstrates a wave-like Interference Pattern called a \u201cQuantum Interference Pattern\u201d. A \u201cquantum\u201d is an indivisible particle. A photon is an example of a quantum particle. Now, the Quantum Interference Pattern implies that a single photon is able to pass through both slits in the barrier at the same (being in two places simultaneously) and interfere with itself just like a wave does. A wave, being a spread out thing can pass through both holes simultaneously, then split into two waves, then these two waves interfere with one another. In some places the two waves meet up peak-to-peak and trough-trough giving a wave twice as tall and in other places peak-to-trough and cancel out each other completely, producing a Wave Interference Pattern (wave-no wave-wave-no wave-wave-no wave. . . and so on). A photon in this same Double Slit Experiment also produces a similar interference pattern, but it is called \u201cQuantum Interference\u201d because the photon is a quantum particle. This is a paradox. How can a particle that is impossible to divide pass through both holes at the same time and then interfere with itself? This is absurd but this is what is observed. How to explain this absurdity? Here comes the \u201cMany World's\" Multiverse interpretation to the rescue. It explains the Quantum Interference of an indivisible photon by postulating the photon in our universe does not travel alone. It travels with its counterparts in parallel universes. However, these \u201cShadow Photons\" from the other parallel universes are undetectable by us. It is these undetectable Shadow Photons passing through one of the two slits that interfere with \u201cour photon\u201d passing through ONE slit, the other of the two slits. So, these undetectable Shadow Photons pass through one of the slits, interfering with Our Photon that passed through the other slit. And Taddah!! I give you the \u201cImpossible\u201d Quantum Interference! Thank you! Thank you very much (?) . . . Well there really is no evidence for The Multiverse and Parallel Universes, but there you have it, an \u201cexplanation\u201d based on The Many World's Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. Not many physicists subscribe to \u201cMany World's\" but it's out there, derived from our most successful physical theory in the history of science. ",

Lets see what wiki has to say on Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty principle: \u201c In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle, also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, such as position x and momentum p, can be known. Introduced first in 1927, by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.\u201d So, basically we can never determine our exact positions. The Schrodinger wave eqns can give us an insight about the probability of a particle wave being being present in a particular point, buts that\u2019s about it. The funny thing about probability is that unless its a sure event, you can never be assured of a specific outcome of an event, unless the event has occurred . So, if I say I am in India, the only thing you can say is yeah, there\u2019s a very very high probability of that. If I say I am on the moon, that would be outrageous, but mathematically, the probability would not be zero (~0, but not 0), so I could be on the moon as well, with a very low probability. Only way to find out where I am is wait till the event has occurred, meaning, to check me when I am firmly settled. But hey, Heisenberg has blocked all your ways from doing it. When you look at the world at a microscopic level, these probabilities do have significant values. So, while particles may not be actually reside at two points at the same time, probability that a particle is where you see it exactly is never 1. That\u2019s my two cents. Physics guys, if you find this hilarious, please don\u2019t bash me in the comments :(. Just downvote it. ",

The analogy I prefer for this probability field comes from biology: An amoeba which can grow and shrink and divide and \u201ceat\u201d things as it moves and the environment around it changes. The amoeba is just a region of space where the particle is \u201cmost likely\u201d to be found\u201d. And the environment is of course just a whole lot of other other amoebas. Some amoebas are of different species (an analogy for the types of force they can interact with.) For example a free electron is a point like amoeba in free space, that can expand and \u201cswallow\u201d a proton as it approaches it to form a hydrogen atom - at which point the amoeba looks like a 1s orbital with a full stomach! Or it can eat a photon and bloat out to a 2s orbital and so on. Or it can divide itself into two or more parts that move apart to exist in an entangled state at different locations. (The analogy breaks a bit here because you do not actually have two daughter amoebas, but one very confused one not quite sure where it is!) Not a perfect analogy of course, but in my opinion much better than the wave/particle duality nonsense. ",

An object with mass cannot multiply its mass. So clearly there cannot be multiple copies of the same particle. On the other hand an object with mass has a gravitational field that extends far and wide. Light-dragging effects From wikipedia \u201c.. gravitational field can be considered as an extension of the object, and carries inertia and momentum\u2026\u201d The gravitational field and probsbly any field, is not something separate from the particle. This observation is important. It essentially means that any object with mass or charge, including sub atomic particles, has a presence that extends beyond the radius of the object proper. All objects with motion affect nearby objects and themselves are affected by nearby objects. They don\u2019t need to touch. The effect might be incredibly small but significant for subatomic particles. Thus giving rise to physicsl phenomena like the wave function, coupling, bonding, etc. So in a very real sense, a particle can \u201cbe\u201d in multiple places at the same time, not as duplicates of the particle, it is just one particle.

The fact of the matter is that a particle may not and does not exist in multiple points of space simultaneously. This misconception we cannot blame on quantum physicists directly but statistics and mathematicians. This is concerning the probable path of a particle through open space. Though, physically a particle only has one finite path through the universe, where the multiple paths comes into play is in our uncertainty of that exact path. Objectivity (philosophy) - Wikipedia Philosophical realism - Wikipedia Philosophical realism is a mandatory concept to learn for anyone if they plan on conceptualizing astrophysical concepts. Founded by Plato, it is the best interpretation infrastructure i have ever seen. \u201cPhilosophers who profess realism often claim that truth consists in a correspondence between cognitive representations and reality.\u201d \u201cKant's rationalism attempted to reconcile the failures he perceived in philosophical realism. Strong versions of this claim hold that there is only one correct description of this reality.\u201d That last part i cannot agree with more, though i also believe Plato made that point clear using much older concepts. I currently have a theory of astrophysics that asserts Plato\u2019s view of reality into a single consistent and objectively based relativity model that does not change based on where you observe it. This is the quint essence of the concept of an absolute measurement. Implying the existence of a true location, true velocity, true distance and true amplitude independent of perceptions through observation which are relative. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t the particle does not have a position at all. I has a state. the stat determines the outcome of measurements. But in every measurement, there is a probability involved. In a state, there may be some probability to find the particle at A or at B. But when you found the particle at A, you do never find it also at B. The measurement also influences the state, so that if you found the particle at A and repeat the measurement, you will find it again at A, never at B. This is called the collapse of the wave function. Roger Penrose calls it the R process. Just forget about all of the classical pictures and learn quantum mechanics. ",

When a Electromagnetic wave front is observered, the wave collapses into the matter of an Electron.  To be more clear, traveling at the speed of light, a wave formation carries all the information about a particule that would form instantaneously when that wave front collapses. So, in that sense, the electron is everywhere n observer might look. ",
