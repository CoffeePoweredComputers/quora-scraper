            "answer_text": "The United States is the only country in the world that still officially stockpiles hundreds of tons of military poisons. For example, Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky holds about 500 tons of various nerve agents. They are slated for destruction, but, for now, they are still there. Nobody needs \u201ca meaningful supply\u201d of Novichok to kill a single person. Allegedly, a single drop can be used to kill a platoon, as long as they get into contact with it. That amount of Novichok can be relatively easily produced in a lab. Novichok hasn\u2019t been \u201csuper-secret\u201d since the 1990s. Its secrets were provided to the West, and the Western labs had more than enough time to study it and even enhance it, if necessary. If I remember correctly, at one point, even a lab in Iran synthesized a tiny amount of Novichok to try the available formula. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. UK and USA have EZ. Russia Novchoch. It's unlikely Russia have used Novoshoch which is very deadly. Scrotal and daughter show more symptoms if EZ and its unlikely Putin would poison an x spy just before he was the favourite to win the election. Also, the sample sent to Switzerland and Austria shoved no Novoshoch. It's rather someone who doesn't want Putin to win who poisoned them. Navalny iis not an important opposition figure un Russia. He doesn't threaten Putin. So if Putin did it, why leave a visiting card. Navalny has many other enemies of state and private oligarchs threatened by his corruption search. If this was Novoshoch he would be dead, and if it was Putin the hospital would not have saved him. And Russia would not let him be transported to Berlin. If Putin wanted him dead he would be dead. Russian doctors saved his life with Atropine. When he was stable for transport here flew to Berlin where they continued with the same treatment, Atropine. Here again, looks more like EZ. Who gains on this. The one who gains most ia USA who wants to stop North Face 2 which seems likely now. OPCW which manipulated the gas attack in Douma won't answer on these accusations and the scripal case. OPCW is controlled by USA where trump has fired inconvenient employees. ",
