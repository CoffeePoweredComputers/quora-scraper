            "answer_text": "700 ml of a mixture contains water and milk in the ratio 2:8 Amount of water in the mixture = (2/(2+8)) x 700 = 140 mL Amount of milk in the mixture = (8/(2+8)) x 700 = 560 mL Let the amount of water added = a In the new mixture, total amount = 700 + a Fraction of water in the new mixture = (140+a)/(700+a) Fraction of milk in the new mixture = 560/(700+a) The ratio becomes 3:8 Therefore, [(140+a)/(700+a)]/[ 560/(700+a)] = 3/8 a =70 mL Ans: 70 mL of water must be added to the mixture Upvote if you like!
