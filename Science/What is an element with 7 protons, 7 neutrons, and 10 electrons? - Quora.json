            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t need to know the number of neutrons and electrons of an atom when identifying what element it is ! Because every element is specialized by the number of protons. Every element can be similar to each other at some features but the number of protons can\u2019t; for example, all Nitrogen atoms have 7 protons in theirs nuclei and contrarily, any atom having 7 protons is Nitrogen ! So, in one day, if that Nitrogen atom has less or more protons, it won\u2019t be Nitrogen anymore ! :D Also, that\u2019s the way to form Periodic Table ! (see more: Periodic table - Wikipedia) Hope you understand ! ;) ",
