            "answer_text": "Iif you mean the opacity to light it will be largely a result of scattering of the light waves by primarily the atomic electron and or the nucleus. There are eleastic and inelastic scattering processes as well as the absorption of energy by electrons resulting in increasing their orbital energy. Look up these processes scattering, light, Rayleigh, Raman, Brillouin, elastic, inelastic ",
