            "answer_text": "Of course it\u2019s real AI. I\u2019m not sure, actually, what \u201cfake AI\u201d is even supposed to be, but I\u2019d certainly not label anything that makes up such a large portion of the academic research \u201cfake AI.\u201d Be careful not to fall victim to the AI effect. Here\u2019s the bottom line: deep learning approaches enable machines to learn to make predictions/decisions from data and/or experience for many problems that we otherwise have failed to directly program equivalently good solutions to ourselves. In some cases, deep learning approaches can learn solutions that not only exceed the performance of the best hand-coded solutions, but also exceed the best human performance. That seems like it more than passes the threshold for being \u201creal AI.\u201d Perhaps, though, what you really mean to ask is: if we just keep throwing more data and more compute power at existing deep learning algorithms, will they be able to become as generally capable as humans for all the same cognitive tasks we carry out? No, that seems unlikely. Replicating human capability for all of the set of tasks we carry out will require answering a lot of additional questions that existing approaches do not have an answer to. Deep learning techniques may very well be part of whatever solution ultimately can do that, but there are additional questions that we have to answer first. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. In nature there are two kinds of intelligence - animal and human. Animal intelligence - An_Int has its purposes set by instincts, and it cannot transcend them in any way. It also, due to the first limitation, cannot deal with abstract concepts - no need, its purposes are all within the category of finding food, shelter, water, mating partners, protect/rise cubs, stop. Human intelligence - Hum_Int - is in fact a combination of An_Int, working as a survival interface driver between human mind and the body, and the human mind. Hum_Int is therefore very hard to define because is entagled with An_Int. An_Int is already decoded (ethology) and recoded (cybernetics) and extensively used in IT. The difference between DeepSomething and An-Int is just the way their purposes are set - An_Int by nature and DeepSmthng by programmers. Both are unable to transcend their capacities. On the other hand, Hum_Int is quite different, or even totally different from such. Hum_Int is personal - (An_Int is too, but actually any animal behave quite similarly in similar situations, therefore their individualization is irrelevant for the purpose of our discussion). Compared with An_Int or Mach_Int (let us call DeepSmthng and its peers Machine Intelligence), Hum_Int is personal, therefore the setting of purposes varies enormously from entity to entity (person to person) so much, that it clears the fact of the human capacity of setting purposes, and that makes Hum_Int a transcendent Int, completely different from An_&Mach_Ints. This capacity, known from a very long time as free will, coupled with the capacity of processing abstractions (capacity lacking in both An_&Mach_Ints) are the main factors conferring Hum_Int its very distinctivness. There is a way to make the essential distinction between An_Int and Hum_Int within the brain. It is done in Yoga. There are mainly 8 stages of Yoga, but we are interested only in two. Pratyahara means withdrawal of senses. It precedes Dharana - concentration, and Dhyana, contemplation/meditaton. This last stage is pure Hum_Int. Meaning that Pratyahara shut down sensorial inputs, allowint human mind to work untangled with animal mind (the OS/driver/interface for external world). Contemplation/meditation is the process through which human mind build metamodels, meaning the models of models, not mere models/patterns as animals do. That is why each human has his/her own inner universe, while animals are lacking such. We may simulate certain aspects of Hum_Int, but without a thorough knowledge of its quintessensials, we do as a researcher of the Sun before the nuclear theory. He would have been able to put together some emitters of UV, IR and light and think he is simulating Sun, but without the knowledge of the way Sun\u2019s core workings, it was just a mere illusion. We may consider Mach_Int as a necessary precursor of real, AGI - on par with Hum_Int. But in reality Mach_Int=Pseudo/Synthetic Intelligence. Synthetic means when taking certain natural parts and putting together to get another natural-like product, but it may look similar with the natural one, without really being one. The analogy is the synthetic diamonds. We take substances and process them into diamonds, we do not manufacture atoms from void energy - we do not produce quarks and putting them together into atoms of carbon and hydrogen that afterwards we process them into diamonds. Such diamonds will qualify as real artificial - meaning man-made from the very quantum scratch. Sorry for the long story\u2026. ",
