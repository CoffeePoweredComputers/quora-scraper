            "answer_text": "I currently work in a clinical lab at a University and in the past have worked in industry at a contract research organization doing work in biology (histology). I would say that the work-life balance is very good. Most bosses I have come across are flexible if you want to come in early and leave late every every now and then. There is generally the assumption that, if you need to stay late then you will stay late. This has occurred to me only about one day out of every few months in my experience. I can't speak for everyone but I have a lot of interests outside of science (the outdoors, literature, music, running, other stuff) and I have plenty of time to do these things to my satisfaction.  I could see it being hard be a good scientist if you are interested in going out an partying every night but other than that a good work/life balance seems totally with-in reason. Edit: While I've never come across it myself there was a Prof. at my school who had just come out of his post-doc in a very intense lab at a prestigious east coast school. He mentioned on one occasion that at that particular lab it was looked down upon not to be in the lab on a saturday, and that if one researcher did not show up on weekends the other researchers talked badly behind their back. As far as I know this is the exception rather than the rule, though burdens of time and effort on lab managers or post-docs sound like they can be quite a bit higher then on technicians or lower scientists. It should also be noted (as Inna points out above) there can be a minor trade off between freedom and pay. For example I make about 3/4 working at the school than I did in industry but there are more resources and flexibility at the school than when I was in industry, for what it's worth. ",

            "answer_text": "I generally found my own work-life balance to be good.  A key part of that was, my work contributed a lot to my happiness.  That is, time at work limited the time I spent on some things (and with some people) that made me happy.  But I never felt that time at work was taking me away from happiness. Here's a question you should ask yourself and your supervisors before starting a project:  How hard am I going to have to work on this project in order to continue working in this field after I finish this project? That is, how competitive is your field;  how many people are working on the same or very similar projects; how many job openings (or grants) are there for people doing this kind of work;  and, of course, how quickly can I do this work?  If there are 10 professors, each graduating one new PhD a year in your field, and there are only two new post doc positions a year and only one faculty position every two years, you're probably going to work 100 hours a week.  This happens, especially to PhD students.  Pick your projects wisely. Something similar also happens in industry.  If you are working on a new product, you may be trying to get everything finished in time for a scheduled demonstration or show.  Or you may know that a competing company is working on a similar product.  Or (I've lived through this) the competitor has already launched a good product and you are still a few months away from your own product's lunch.  Time demands can get crazy.  Time for other things can shrink. There are lots of happy stories and also some sad stories.  Good luck with your story. ",
