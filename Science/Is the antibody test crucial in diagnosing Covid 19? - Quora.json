            "answer_text": "Serological tests detect antibodies present in the blood when the body is responding to a specific infection, like COVID-19. They detect the body\u2019s immune response to the infection caused by the virus rather than detecting the virus itself. Experience with other viruses suggests that individuals whose blood contains antibodies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection\u2014provided they are recovered and not currently infected with the virus\u2014may be able to resume work and other daily activities in society. They may also be eligible to serve as potential donors of convalescent plasma. In the early days of an infection, when the body\u2019s immune response is still building, antibodies may not be present in detectable levels. This limits the test\u2019s effectiveness for diagnosing COVID-19 and is why it should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose COVID-19. Currently authorized serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 measure IgM and/or IgG antibodies. Since IgM antibodies may not develop early, or at all, in infected patients, this type of antibody test is not used to rule out SARS-CoV-2 in an individual. Since IgG antibodies generally do not develop until later, this type of antibody test, even though it is more specific to SARS-CoV-2, is not used to rule-out SARS-CoV-2 infection in an individual. We also do not know how long IgM or IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 will remain present in the body after the infection has been cleared. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically \u2014 like many other issues surrounding this deadly virus \u2014 we cannot say, with any certainty. Because, it is a new virus. It is so new \u2014 in fact \u2014 That, we are still not certain if it is possible to become infected twice. In fact, the World Health Organization stated that they have many scientists studying this issue, but (gulp) nobody knows. It is a new virus. A very new virus. The first science on this began less than five months ago. And, most of that science has tended to be focused on things like \u201ctreatment\u201d or \u201cfind a vaccine!\u201d or \u201chow does it really spread?\u201d Those scientists trying to study your question have been slowed, because a few tests were introduced which appear to be less than 100% valid. That tends to slow down those scientists studying this issue. In fact, this occurred mostly in the United States, where a few states began using some tests to show whether one had the antibodies within their system, which were showing way too many \u201cfalse positives\u201d and way too many \u201cfalse negatives.\u201d That can kind of slow things down\u2026 Arrrrgh! Right now, the tests to show whether you have the virus at this very moment now are much more accurate. But, if you take the test to try to show if you had it, in the past \u2014 it can even depend upon where you live\u2026 The test may or may not be very trustworthy. A couple of Governors are still using tests that scientists have decreed are a bit bogus. Remember \u2014 this is less than 5 months old. As far as we can say. Five months. Remember \u2014 this is new. Even the symptoms were revised, only two weeks ago. We are learning every day. In many cases, we are learning, every hour. Remember \u2014 this is new. 'No Evidence' Yet That Recovered COVID-19 Patients Are Immune, WHO Says It MAY be that you can only catch this disease once. But, it MAY NOT be that you can only catch this disease once. Remember \u2014 this is new. ",
