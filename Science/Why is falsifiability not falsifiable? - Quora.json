            "answer_text": "A nonsense question! Falsifiability refers to a theory (and its sentences: laws); \u201cfalsifiability\u201d is not a name of a theory like a principle is not a law; one cannot use the principle of induction to prove a law of induction because such law does not exist; principles are used (as axioms-in formal science). We use them to prove laws and other principles. One does not prove a non-contradiction principle;one uses a non-contradiction principle to prove laws and sentences (of science) ",

            "answer_text": "Some formulations are and have been. If you formulate falsifiability as a definition, then it\u2019s not falsifiable because definitions are not falsifiable. If you formulate it as the essential ingredient for doing science, that was falsified during Popper\u2019s lifetime. ",
