            "answer_text": "Yes, they\u2019re real. What do they do? That depends on what\u2019s around them. In empty space, a black hole will just sit there spinning, warping space-time around them. If there\u2019s matter nearby it will be drawn towards the thing just as though it was a really big star, and if that stuff isn\u2019t moving fast enough to establish a stable orbit it winds up getting drawn in. If there\u2019s so much matter that it can\u2019t physically enter the whole without basically lining up it can create an \u2018accretion disk\u2019 which is sort of like a whirlpool. That will generally lead to \u2018jets\u2019 of matter and energy being ejected from the magnetic poles of the black hole. This is common during the early life of the supermassive black holes at the centers of most if not all galaxies. Those jets were called \u2018quasars\u2019 when first detected. They looked like stars but they were very, very far away. ",
