            "answer_text": "The bottom line here is that demons are not of a scientific realm. They do not adhere to the confines, limitations, or restrictions of the physical world. Science exists in the physical world. The only thing I can say that would give any link between a demon and science is the fact that they are comprised of energy. If you encounter a negative entity (demon) that does not inhabit a physical body, there are ways to see it. It's very subtle and tricky but possible. If you know what energy looks like you can identify it. It is somewhat fuzzy and kind if blurry when you see it at first. I actual see them in a humaoid shape and form. As pure energy if they are somehow coming through to this world(which means you've unknowingly let them get in through your actions or interest) then your intuition will let you know you're not alone usually. But your vision will tell you as well. The best time to begin is dusk or most often dawn. The lighting seems to expose them better. Imagine a blurry person you can see through but you still see through them. Nearly invisible, but not invisible. If you can meditate and slow your mind and body down and just observe the environment very gently you will see them. They prefer to be out of sight, they can actually sense you looking at them and will freeze. So just remain calm, they cannot hurt you unless you think they can. Only through fear can they harm you. Therefore not being afraid is your defense. This has occurred several times in my life. I've had many many run ins with what I perceive to be a mischievous spirit that desires only to inflict a state of negative emotion and confusion in me and my close ones. They love to drive you crazy, using your own logic and sense making against you. And they are damn good at it and quite Wiley. But remember we are superior we are both energy and matter. They have no renewable source of energy meaning they are feeding off of your energy. Most of which comes from attention and curiosity. Forget he's there and you ultimately win. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there is. It\u2019s just not reliable or adequate evidence. The evidence of people\u2019s individual testimonies, video recordings, etc. is evidence. It could well be explained by a myriad of other things, from fakes to insanity. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If you were saying that a species of bird that had never been reported in the county you live in but had been one county over did visit your county, some eyewitnesses and a couple of video recordings of the bird would be quite good scientific evidence. Nobody would be amazed that the bird flew an extra few miles. The most plausible answer for your having that evidence is that the bird really visited your county. On the other hand, demons and demonic possession go in the face of all the established scientific wisdom. They would have massive implications. To make such a huge shift in thinking, far, far more than a couple of phone camera videos and some witnesses would be required. Any possibility of you generating that video by trickery would have to be eliminated. In these days of home computer CGI produced videos of incredible quality, video evidence wouldn\u2019t be accepted. (See Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning - Wikipedia if you don\u2019t believe me.) You would need to have such clear and abundant hard and examinable physical evidence that there could be no conclusion but that demons were real. Capturing a \u201clive\u201d demon might do. I\u2019m not trying to say that there are no demons. I personally do believe in them. ",
