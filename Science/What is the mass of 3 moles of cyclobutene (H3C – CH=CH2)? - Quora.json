            "answer_text": "The formula shown has only three carbons (it\u2019s propene). To get the molar mass of a hydrocarbon, multiply the totTo fial number of carbons by 12 and the total number of hydrogens by 1. Add the masses contributed by the C\u2019s and the H\u2019s. To find the mass of three moles of compound, multiply the molar mass by three. ",
