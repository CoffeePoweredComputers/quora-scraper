            "answer_text": "While at senior school I worked as a chemistry technician for the lunch breaks and after school for a couple of hours. Told to make up a 1 M solution of Sulphuric Acid. Filled a sink up with cold water and put the winchester in the water. Added the cold distilled water to the winchester. Measured out the concentrated Sulphuric Acid. Added this slowly to the water. Therefore acid to water. That way you only have a small amount of acid in a large volume of water. Keep adding the acid to the water , at a slow rate until it has all been added. Of course you will be wearing gloves and eye protection. The solution will become hot , even after being immersed in cold water. Just place the top on the bottle and don\u2019t screw it in. Leave it overnight with a Warning Sign and in the morning ,Acid solution should be room temperature and ready to screw the top in. Take the winchester out of the water and add a Label plus health & safety skin corrosion label. ",

            "answer_text": "you have plenty of excellent answers here, but the simple answer is because you are told to do it that way. old men learned the hard way and passed it down to you. believe it. I grew up in Boston and we were told \u201cYah ahdd acid to da wahtah, cause dat\u2019s da way yah oughtah\u201d. I can give you an example of what happens if you don\u2019t. on a large job once, i was pumping drums of concentrated sulfuric acid into a tanker. I checked every single drum before pumping it because I knew if one drum of the wrong stuff got in there, it would be a catastrophe. I also knew that even the same acid of slightly different concentrations were mixed, it would generate some heat. I would occasionally put my hand on the side of the tank to check the temp. it did get a little warm, but not enough to be of concern. On the other side of the plant, another \u201cchemist\u201d was performing exactly the same process. he noticed that the tank was heating up and he panicked, went and got a fire hose and pointed it into the top of the tank, thinking he would cool it down. of course, it had exactly the opposite effect. the result: he melted the teflon liner out of the stainless steel tanker trailer, causing $250,000 in damage. My load was without incident. ",
