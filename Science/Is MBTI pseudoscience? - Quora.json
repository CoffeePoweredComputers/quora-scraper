            "answer_text": "Yes and no. MBTI is a tool, and more specifically, it\u2019s a mislabeled tool that most people misuse by trying to use it for what it says it is, rather than for what it actually is. The first thing you need to understand before anything else\u2026 is that MBTI is NOT a personality test! If you try to use it as one, it will basically wind up being useless and giving a ton of erroneous data back to you. Before we get started, an analogy to get an idea of what we\u2019ll be covering: MBTI is a screwdriver with the word HAMMER written in large letters on the side, and it\u2019s not a bad screwdriver, but it sucks as a hammer. You can use it as one, but you\u2019re missing the point if you do. It\u2019s not the best screwdriver the world has ever seen, and could use some improvements in that category, but it doesn\u2019t do a bad job as a screwdriver. You kind of need to know it\u2019s a screwdriver though to know to swap out the correct bits depending upon the screw you\u2019re trying to screw in, though. Aaand\u2026 to be blunt, it\u2019s an old screwdriver and missing a few of the bits you might need. So\u2026 if it\u2019s not a personality test (or a hammer), what is it? To put it in simple terms, MBTI just checks off which methods you prefer to solve problems with. Note that it specifically doesn\u2019t even try to test to see if you\u2019re even any good at using those methods, and depending upon how truthfully you answer the questions in any test, it may only note which ones you would like to use, whether you actually use them or not. With this in mind, however, there are some things you can take away from it which are useful to know. The first of these is that there are multiple ways of looking at the world, and that everyone uses a combination of methods to solve different problems in different situations and with different context. The second is that, even though every individual is different, there are going to be trends which do begin to build up over time: people who prefer to use a particular method for solving problems will tend to do so because they have certain things they value and certain behavioural patterns will typically emerge, but not always. So long as you keep these things in mind, MBTI can be a moderately effective tool for understanding yourself a bit better and for understanding the people around you as well. The key is to look at it as simply a measurement of what ways people look at the world when it comes to solving problems. Do they rely on their gut instinct? Perhaps they put a disproportionately large amount of value upon logical reasoning? Do they prefer to gather as much data as possible before doing anything at all, or would they rather begin with quick, broad strokes which get refined over time as more information is acquired? Once you understand what the MBTI is actually describing, you can actually use it as a tool to help you out in life. I delved into it when I was trying to decide what to do with my life, what to do for college, what kinds of things I wanted to learn and so on. What I discovered through this, was a framework to describe how I operate in a fairly rough manner: I like solving problems, but once the problems are all solved, I get bored and would rather delegate the implementation of the solution to someone else. This is almost universal among those who are labeled ENTP such as myself, because the methods of problem solving tend to be closely associated with that pattern of behaviour due to innately shared value structures. The reason why you would prefer the Ne and Ti functions most often, are largely the same reasons why you would prefer to solve problems and then move onto the next problem to solve. This isn\u2019t guaranteed, as there are multiple reasons for why you may have this preference, but it\u2019s common enough that you can get a fairly good guesstimate of why someone behaves a certain way. Further study of the individual (such as just asking them =P ) can give better details, though they themselves may not understand why they do the things they do on a conscious level. This part isn\u2019t quite scientific currently as it stands, though it easily could be studied to a greater degree than it actually has been. Trying to use MBTI as a personality test by enforcing that \u201call people of X type behave in manner Y\u201d is absolute garbage and useless, so don\u2019t even try. If anything, it actively reduces your capacity to understand people better by trying to force them into categories which aren\u2019t reasonable, and it really just doesn\u2019t work that way. What MBTI tests is only one portion of what leads to a comprehensive understanding of a person\u2019s behaviour, and by itself, it can be very misleading without further information and context. As such, for those who try to use it as a personality test\u2026 yeah, it\u2019s basically pseudoscience and more or less worthless. Using MBTI as a tool to try to understand how people go about trying to interact with the world and how they deal with problems they encounter, however, it\u2019s actually not too bad at that. I think it has a limited scope of problem solving methods it tests, however, and it doesn\u2019t really put much emphasis on the thing it\u2019s actually doing, instead claiming to be something it\u2019s not, buuuut if you use it for what it\u2019s actually good at doing, it\u2019s alright. It\u2019d be better if it were refined further, and someone seriously has to fix the mislabeling issue so that people stop trying to use the screwdriver as a hammer, but it\u2019s pretty reasonable for what it does. It\u2019d also be nice if we could get an updated set of bits for the tip so it would cover more of the various problem solving methods, and it\u2019d be even better still if they labeled them properly. So yeah, not the best tool for the job at the moment, but it\u2019s not useless, it\u2019s just missing a few parts and people try to use it the wrong way is all. ",

            "answer_text": "That probably depends what people use it for. If people say \u201cit\u2019s a personality test; it\u2019s fun to find out what result you get and whether we get the same or not\u201d, then that\u2019s not pseudoscience. But people seem to read far more into it than just a bit of fun. They do all the same stuff with it that other people do with horoscopes, and with scarcely greater justification. Ah, you\u2019re a Sagitarius/INTJ, of course you enjoyed reading books on philosophy! So I would call it more or less pseudoscience, because people do take it a bit seriously and it was ultimately just plucked more or less out of the air. It wasn\u2019t put together using cluster analysis or factor analysis or whatever; there is no great body of literature on correlations with real-life outcomes to my knowledge, except that produced by self-declared advocates of the utility of it (which does not seem to be objectively justifiable). It deserves all the criticism that the concept of IQ gets and does not deserve. To be clear, it\u2019s not pseudoscience if it doesn\u2019t purport to be science. I could write a book arguing that Europe may decline for the same reasons that Rome declined, and that would not be pseudoscience \u2014 because no-one would be claiming that it\u2019s science. If anyone claims that there is something scientific about MBTI, then I think it is pseudoscience, because it doesn\u2019t seem to have any scientific basis.  Apparently this is controversial. Look, for something to be \u201cscience\u201d, it has to fit certain criteria. It has to be able to make concrete verifiable predictions that other competing theories cannot make. These predictions must be correct. If it doesn\u2019t do this, then it might be \u201cgreat\u201d and it might be helpful, but it\u2019s not science. If people claim that it\u2019s science, that then would make it pseudoscience. If they don\u2019t claim that it\u2019s science, it\u2019s not pseudoscience. The works of Shakespeare, the Bible, and the works of Plato, contain many great insights into human nature and many profound observations. Yet these works are not science. For all I know, MBTI may be of much use to people and may contain many insights within it. I still do not see how it is science. What predictions does it make that other theories do not make, and that are actually right? One thing it does seem to do, is to claim that human personality may be evaluated along four dimensions. This poses as a scientific claim. Yet the four dimensions of MBTI appear to be the wrong dimensions; MBTI uses four dimensions that are substantially correlated, rather than being maximally independent. The Big Five personality trait system used factor analysis to derive five maximally independent traits, and therefore has a scientific basis that MBTI lacks. MBTI essentially uses just a ragbag of questions of no especial value. The works of Carl Jung are not science, and MBTI being based upon those doesn\u2019t help. What MBTI does is no better than if I myself sat down right now, invented some personality traits, invented questions to assess them, and claimed my work was actually important. Would I come up with correlated traits? Would I miss vital facets of human nature? Yes, I would, and that is what MBTI has done. Is my assertion hurtful to people? Perhaps it is. But when we say that homeopathy does not work, or that vitamin supplements are as often harmful as helpful and usually useless, or that much of the Bible is not literally true, we hurt people\u2019s feelings. There are people who have built their lives around these things. Even so, we must answer questions honestly to the best of our ability. We cannot let the truth become a casualty to sensitivity. Each of us, in my view, has a duty to speak the truth as they see it. What is ironic, is that some of the people who love MBTI, are scathing about the Bible or homeopathy. Yet the moment they were offered something that seemed slightly more appealing to their sensibilities \u2014 slightly more scientifically plausible \u2014 they eagerly leapt upon it, and they now defend it from attack. All that a dubious idea had to do in order to gain favour with them, was to cloak itself in something that looked a bit like science. They considered themselves sceptical, but in truth they merely demanded something that posed as science. Am I wrong? Show me the studies that indicates MBTI is better than any old set of \u201cpersonality traits\u201d that I might just make up off the top of my head. Show me how is it better than ordinary common assumptions (which are often wrong and are sometimes right). It seems to me that where MBTI is right, it has simply reiterated bits of common knowledge. Sure enough, some people like spending time alone more than others, but that\u2019s not a great insight. Where it deviates from common knowledge, it is wrong, or cannot be proven right or useful. Therefore, it is not science; at best it is in the same category as a good work of fiction that people feel sheds light on human nature. I\u2019m not telling anyone to toss out MBTI. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not science, that\u2019s all. I also don\u2019t advocate throwing out the Bible or Shakespeare or the works of Plato. I don\u2019t consider MBTI to be in the same league as these others, but it\u2019s a modern classic for sure. By all means enjoy it. Just don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s science, unless you have the studies to prove it. If you yourself find MBTI useful or interesting or whatever, well, people feel the same about the Bible and homeopathy, or the works of the Stoics; that doesn\u2019t make any of them science. Finally, here\u2019s Wikipedia. There\u2019s a lot of nonsense on Wikipedia, but in this case I really think it hits the nail on the head. Myers\u2013Briggs Type Indicator - Wikipedia Though the MBTI resembles some psychological theories, it is commonly classified as pseudoscience, especially as it pertains to its supposed predictive abilities. The test exhibits significant scientific (psychometric) deficiencies, notably including poor validity (i.e. not measuring what it purports to measure, not having predictive power or not having items that can be generalized), poor reliability (giving different results for the same person on different occasions), measuring categories that are not independent (some dichotomous traits have been noted to correlate with each other), and not being comprehensive (due to missing neuroticism).
