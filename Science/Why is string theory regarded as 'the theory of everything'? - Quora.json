            "answer_text": "String Theory is NOT regarded as a valid theory and certainly not as a \u201cTheory of Everything\u201d!! A theory of everything is a theory that is the simplest possible and that can predict everything or explain everything. String Theory is not a theory and cannot predict anything. It has too many degrees of freedom (a.k.a. parameters). You cannot use more than 5 parameters to describe 5 particles for instance. For example, imagine that I am creating a great theory that uses 10 parameters to describe the masses of 5 particles. That theory could be easily replaced with another that just uses the particle masses as parameters. There is not benefit on making an overly complex theory because an overly complex theory is NOT FUNDAMENTAL. It is overfitting or a overfitting theory:  My theory explains the whole Universe and every particle with just 7 or 8 parameters. That is how it is done. ",

            "answer_text": "Its not even a theory. It's a concept at best and it's been that way for almost 30 years now. I think string theorists are more interested in putting out a theory thats mathematically \u201celegant\u201d than putting one out that even remotely works. By comparison, the Ultraviolet Catastrophe, barely makes a blip on the radar with regards to failed theories. It just plain doesn't model or correctly predict anything we observe in the physical world with the occasional exception being an idealized blackholle with no spin or no charge. They basically patted themselves on the back for awhile there cause they created a theory that accurately models something that will never be found in the universe. It's insanity. ",
