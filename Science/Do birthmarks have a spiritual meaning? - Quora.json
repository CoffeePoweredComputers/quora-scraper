            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Lyndsay Tobin ! There's a lot of superstition regarding birthmarks, historically and presently. In fact, they've been called both \u201cAngel Kisses\u201d and \u201cThe Devil's Mark.\u201d Throughout history, birthmarks were feared by superstitious, paranoid, and religious fanatics. But in the present day, many believe birthmarks are indeed lucky omens with special meanings indicating reincarnation, life purpose, or destiny. Some people believe that birthmarks are clues to the cause of injury or death from the previous lifetime. In this case the location of a birthmark on the body could indicate a wound. In addition, the shape of the birthmark could be even more telling. For example, a sword or dagger could indicate a stabbing. A flame or torch shape could mean a prior death by fire. A circular marking could indicate a bullet hole. One man was told by a psychic that his birthmark that resembles a hangman gallows meant he had been hung\u2014and in his case, unjustly so! Some people believe that anyone who does not have any birthmarks died of natural causes in their past life. [\u2026] It has been speculated that certain birthmark shapes might indicate a specific trade or ethnic group from a former incarnation. Some believe that birthmarks imprint upon the soul a memory, or a reminder of a lesson learned in a previous incarnation, so as to avoid a similar path or conflict in present day. Animal shaped birthmarks can indicate a special connection with the animal kingdom, and specific to the spirit animal teachings. [\u2026] Favorable birthmarks are those that resemble protective symbols such as a rabbit's foot, a four-leaf clover, horseshoe, angel wings, etc. Rather than carrying good luck amulets in your pocket you already have a built in shield. You have been blessed by spirit or the angels. Birthmarks have also been thought to be forms of identification, helping twin flames or soul mates to reunite. Heart-shaped birthmarks are especially beloved\u2014a symbol of universal love. [\u2026] Crescent moon, shooting stars, and sunbursts are favored birthmarks. Some people with such birthmarks often will feel a strong connection to the cosmos, looking to the skies during introspective periods. Others have reported birthmark shapes that align with their zodiac signs, such as an archer, scorpion, or libra scales. Superstitions and Spiritual Meanings of Birthmarks Although experts do not really understand what causes birthmarks, the medical community has categorized them and explained their appearance. Some cultures have legends and folklore that lend spiritual meaning to these identifying marks. [\u2026] Some birth marks are hereditary, and others are not. Not all birthmarks appear exactly at birth, but sometimes can appear much later. Depending on the type of birthmark, it may darken, fade, shrink, grow or disappear as the child grows older. Occasionally, birthmarks can signal greater underlying medical issues like nerve and skin disorders or cancer. Most birthmarks do not cause any physical harm, but some can lead to emotional or psychological distress if the blemish is viewed as unsightly or disfiguring. It is not understood why some babies have birthmarks, and others do not. While the medical community can explain birthmarks as either vascular or pigmented in their origins, there is no clear explanation as to why they occur. There is no known way to prevent birthmarks, but there are treatment and removal options for certain types. [\u2026] Many cultures and religions around the world have folklore related to the significance of birthmarks. These beliefs often promote stigma and superstition around the meaning of birthmarks. Many of these stories have references to past lives and injuries or traumas that may have occurred in another life. Some of them even explain birthmarks as symbols of a stressor to the mother during the pregnancy, or of her unfulfilled wishes. Many of these spiritual explanations even focus on the location of the birthmark, to foretell distinguishing characteristics of the child. A scientific study by Dr. Ian Stevenson found links between birthmarks, and recollections from children of past lives. He concluded that in many cases, children provided evidence that coincided with their memories of experiences in a past life. In many circumstances, the children exhibited birthmarks that correlated with wounds, injuries, torture, and even the cause of their death in past lives. Stevenson provided verifiable information related to these cases. These birthmarks are often labeled as psychic birthmarks. The Secret Meanings Behind Birthmarks Almost nothing is known about why pigmented birthmarks (moles or nevi) occur in particular locations of the skin. The causes of most birth defects are also unknown. About 35% of children who claim to remember previous lives have birthmarks and/or birth defects that they (or adult informants) attribute to wounds on a person whose life the child remembers. The cases of 210 such children have been investigated. The birthmarks were usually areas of hairless, puckered skin; some were areas of little or no pigmentation (hypopigmented macules); others were areas of increased pigmentation (hyperpigmented nevi). The birth defects were nearly always of rare types. In cases in which a deceased person was identified the details of whose life unmistakably matched the child's statements, a close correspondence was nearly always found between the birthmarks and/or birth defects on the child and the wounds on the deceased person. In 43 of 49 cases in which a medical document (usually a postmortem report) was obtained, it confirmed the correspondence between wounds and birthmarks (or birth defects). There is little evidence that parents and other informants imposed a false identity on the child in order to explain the child's birthmark or birth defect. Some paranormal process seems required to account for at least some of the details of these cases, including the birthmarks and birth defects. Dr. Ian Stevenson's Reincarnation Research Personally, I maintain a healthy scepticism regarding spiritual explanations for natural phenomena, due to the fact that most such spiritual explanations have been thoroughly debunked by science. This isn't the case with regards to birthmarks yet, of course, so I'm still on the fence. I myself have a birthmark, roughly in the shape of an entry-wound, on my temple. Various gypsies and psychics (I have both Irish gypsy and Romany gypsy heritage) have offered different explanations, all of which contradict each other and have had no effect on my life. But again\u2026 That's just my personal experience. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a wealth of scientific data on birthmarks and their spiritual origin, specifically the scientific studies done by Dr. Ian Stevenson and Dr. Jim Tucker on reincarnation at the University of Virginia. The birthmarks that are slightly bloody at birth are of most interest. They have been shown to correspond to fatal and near fatal injury in the past life of the reincarnated soul. The injury to the spiritual body and the negative energy from it, are imprinted on the infant\u2019s body when the spirit enters its new life. These birth marks are more than just a mark, they are a sign of the unhealed, spiritual injury. A very close friend of mine was born with a birthmark in the middle of her chest and suffered for years from spinal pain. She was always deathly afraid of hand guns, not rifles, just pistols. School medicine never was able to find the source her back pain and it took a spiritual healer to recognize that the birthmark represented the entry wound and back pain was in the the place where the bullet lodged in her spine. Healing the spiritual body, eliminated the physical pain. This story reveals a spiritual law - physical injury can damage the spirit and an injured spirit can damage the body. But the spirit can also heal the body. ",

Do birthmark have meaning? Or, do birthmarks have a meaning in addition to being a birthmark? Yes, they have the additional meaning we assign to them. Different people assign different meanings. The additional meanings they assign are meaningful to them. Sometimes those meaning also resonate with others. So called \u201cspiritual\u201d meanings tend to be valued by those who value invisible, metaphysical, supernatural ideas over visible, physical, natural phenomena.

In a sense they could be called \u201cattachments\u201d, because they indicate a non-resolved karmic issue, but they are certainly not \u201cspiritual\u201d, unless you want to use the adjective as a reference to a \u201cspirit\u201d as in \u201cghostly body\u201d.
