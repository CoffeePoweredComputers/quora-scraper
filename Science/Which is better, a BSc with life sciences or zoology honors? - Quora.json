            "answer_text": "I can understand agony of a guy to decide which is best. I am also in this indecision in my time. Frankly speaking I chose life science because of my keen interest in all three core subject[ZOOLOGY,BOTANY ,CHEMISTRY]. Life science is not a specialisation course, whereas it provide view to all chapter of zoology botany and chemistry. Most PROS point is that after graduation you can go for your masters in all allied course of biology like microbiology,biotechnology,biochemistry , Zoology, botany, genetics etc. And if you are planning for JAM ,then it will be quite helping in entrance because you have read chemistry and have a good knowledge so you\u201dll not have to put an extra effort. And if you go for a job after your Graduation then: There is a wide scope for students with BSc life science in India as well as foreign countries. Sea food and fish products are in demand and this sector provides opportunities for life science students. They can pursue research in life science which helps them to identify the wide range of products and techniques in the respective field. Biotechnology and fish genetics are two important areas where the life science students have a lot to explore and research. More details about the scope for http://B.F.Sc students after their course are given below. Job Types Agronomist Biochemist Biomedical Engineer Biophysicist Epidemiologist Food Scientist Horticulturist Immunologist Nutritionist Palaeontologist Pathologist Researcher Science Teacher Employment Areas Agriculture Animal Care Bio-Informatics Biotechnology Beverage Industry Environmental Protection Agencies Farm Houses Food Processing Industry Health Clubs Laboratories Chemical Industries Disease Control Ecological Modelling Molecular Biology Medicine and Pharmaceutical Industries Parks Pollution Control So it will completely depends on you and your future planning . Best of luck!! Be free to correspond me, I\u2019m also a life science graduate\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "I was in same dilemma at my time. It was very difficult for me to decide, Zoology or life science. Finally, I went for life science because Bsc Life Science includes Zoology, Botany and Chemistry as core subjects. And has wider scope as compared to Zoology honours as you can go in any field in future. Go for Zoology honours if you want to study about animals basically and Go for life science if you're not sure for your masters or whatever after graduation. ",
