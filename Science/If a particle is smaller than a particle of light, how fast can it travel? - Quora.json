            "answer_text": "If a particle is smaller than a particle of light, how fast can it travel? Well.. the first problem you hit is that it\u2019s difficult to define \u201csmaller\u201d when the thing you\u2019re comparing it to has zero mass, and your particle *does* have mass. And at those scales, \u201csize\u201d is a problematic measure as well, because things start behaving more like chunks of fog than nice well-behaved spheres. If it doesn\u2019t have mass, it has to travel at the speed of light. Period. If it has mass, it has to travel under the speed of light in a vacuum. Period. It can go faster than light *in a given material* - for example, light moves at about 67% of its vacuum speed in water, and a particle can go at 80% of light\u2019s vacuum speed in water. The result is that it radiates away energy in something called Cherenkov radiation - that\u2019s the blue glow you see at the bottom of storage tanks at a nuclear reactor. We know that the yet-undetected massless graviton would move at the speed of light in a vacuum. I admit not knowing what current theory says about its behavior while passing through an object with mass - whether it stays the same speed or if it obeys a rule similar to the index of refraction for photons.

            "answer_text": "Well that is not hard. A particle of light is a called a photon. A photon does not need to be visible light. The size of a photon is the wavelength. And there are radio waves with much longer wavelengths than me. So I am smaller than a particle of \u201clight\u201d. Yet, I have the same velocity restrictions as something larger than the something larger than that same particle of \u201clight\u201d. So size truly does not matter, in terms of velocity. Well almost. If I were smaller than ALL particles of light, that would implied I was on the order of the size of a planck unit in size. That would mean my kenetic energy was much much greater than my rest mass. So I would have to be travelling at almost exactly the speed of light in the reference frame where I was measured to be so small. ",
