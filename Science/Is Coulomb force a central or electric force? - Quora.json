            "answer_text": "Um, electric? Coulomb force is another name for electrostatic force; they\u2019re the same thing. I\u2019m not sure what you mean by central force, but if it means what I think it means then yes, it is also a central force. It was designed to work with point charges. To be fair, using calculus, you can also use it for continuous charge distributions (charge stuff\u2026 gooey charge\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to describe it; painted charge\u2026 I hope you get it), while it was theoretically formed considering discrete charge distributions (point charges). For continuous charge distributions, you don\u2019t really think about \u201ccenters\u201d of the charge unless using very special shapes; it\u2019s better practice to think about the big picture: all of the charge together, rather than individual charges in distinct locations, or points. Hope this helps. ",
