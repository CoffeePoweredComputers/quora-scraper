            "answer_text": "Homeopathy isn\u2019t even a science. Brief (if not 100% accurate) summary: The scientific method is based on testing the validity of hypotheses: by rigorously testing them in such a way that they can be disproved or proved, whilst ensuring all other confounding factors are excluded, and using large enough data sets that any random variations become insignificant. This evidence basis is what modern medicine is mostly based on. The homeopathic method is based on the following principles: That like cures like - a substance causing effects \u201csimilar\u201d to one\u2019s symptoms should cure it.That dilution of said curative agent will increase the potency of its effects - that water has a \u201cmemory\u201d.This belief in water having a memory extends to water \u201cremembering\u201d things such as exposure to Xrays or sunlight, prior to dilution. Sometimes even the dreams of the homeopath preparing the dilution!Selection from a formulary based on the person\u2019s life history, balance of humours, even star signs.That disease is caused by miasma.Do any of those look like application of the scientific method, or even the theories established through scientific method? That should be your answer straight away.  But let\u2019s see if we can apply scientific method to see if the treatments have any merit? homeopathy The Cochrane foundation review all studies pertaining to a certain question, evaluate the strength of said studies, and utilises the highest quality evidence to come to a conclusion. And unfortunately, these studies find that the only evidence in support of homeopathy is of poor quality, meaning that the effects of homeopathy can\u2019t truly be proven to be distinguishable from uncontrolled variables, or placebo.  So I would suggest if you want to prove or disprove it, construct some high quality randomised controlled trials into the effects of homeopathy versus placebo, and see whether they disprove the hypothesis that homeopathy is no different to placebo.

            "answer_text": "Q. Is Homeopathy a Pseudoscience?  (1) Short answer: Yes, because it does not meet the rigor of the Scientific method, and Falsifiability.Its effect is often equated to the \u2018Placebo Effect\u2019.That said, it can bring real comfort to patients.Questions on the standing of homeopathy, just like questions on economics and Psychoanalysis, are not best answered by reaching for a single criteria to demarcate science and pseudoscience.(2) What is homeopathy? Homeopathic medicines are created, for the most part, by taking small quantities of plants and minerals, which are then repeatedly diluted in water, shaken vigorously, diluted again, before being added to sugar pills. The substances are selected using the hypothesis \u2018like cures like\u2019. If a substance would harm you in high concentration, the same substance in an exceptionally weak dosage will fight those very symptoms. Smallpox was initially controlled by deliberately placing infectious material from smallpox pustules into a scratch in a healthy person\u2019s skin, as inoculation. So, the \u2018like cures like\u2019 principle is not so obviously absurd. But, homeopathic treatments are diluted and re-diluted so many times that we should often expect there to be no molecules of the supposedly therapeutic substance present. Is it a mere sugar pill backed by an interesting back-story? (3) Testing, but against what? Forget homeopathy for now. Let\u2019s discuss the testing basis for mainstream pharmaceuticals. There is an existing ailment. The existing established medicine is X. A new, supposedly improved, medicine Y, is to be tested. The standard pharma industry regime is to test a new medicine against a placebo.When X originally came on, it was tested against a placebo.X became \u2018standard treatment\u2019.Y came on new.Per pharma process, Y tested against a placebo.But, should Y be tested against X instead? Y is supposed to be better than X.If both X and Y are available in the pharma market, a doctor has to decide which to prescribe to a patient. How will the doctor know this if Y was never tested against X?Trials of new medicines (Y) compared against \u2018standard treatment\u2019 (X), is more expensive to conduct than placebo-controlled trials. The number of test participants need to be higher, in order to get a more meaningful statistical result.It\u2019s also much easier to produce a new drug (Y) that is better over the placebo, than a \u2018standard treatment\u2019 (X).Self-evidently, pharma companies favor trials against placebo.(4) Testing basis for Complementary and Alternative medicine We\u2019re talking about homeopathy, acupuncture, aromatherapy, herbalism, etc. (4a) Issue #1: No placebo-equivalent test For homeopathy, there could be a placebo-controlled test. But, what about massage therapy for a neck ailment? What is the placebo equivalent test? A pressureless massage? Do we dismiss a treatment because we can\u2019t design a suitable test-placebo? Are we missing out on anything? (4b) Issue #2: How to test holistic treatment? In mainstream medicine, we\u2019re familiar that depression is treated with Prozac (Fluoxetine). High cholesterol, Lipitor (Atorvastatin). But, what if a doctor doesn\u2019t assign a type of medicine to a type of disease condition. But instead, attempts to evaluate the overall situation of the patient. Suppose the doctor claims that symptoms, biography, lifestyle all interact in complex ways, and offers the patient a customized blend of medicines, exercise, diet, etc on the conviction that these act in a synergistic, integrated way on the patient as a whole. How do we setup a clinical trial for this, that involve idiosyncrasies of individual patients? Do we dismiss a treatment because we can\u2019t design a suitable trial? Are we missing out on anything? In homeopathy, treatment is usually tailored to the individual. A homeopathic prescription is based not only on the symptoms of the disease, but also on a host of other factors particular to the patient such as lifestyle, emotional health, personality, eating habits, medical history. Homeopathic practitioners are exercising their judgment in concentrating on the needs of the patients as individuals, rather than adopting a the \u2018cookbook\u2019 approach. (5) Placebo Effect The process of trialling new treatments against a placebo can encourage us to write-off the placebo effect as insignificant. But, the placebo effect is not negligible, nor is it uniform. Taking a sugar pill can make someone feel better.Taking 4 can make them feel better still.The intensity of the placebo delivery correlates with its efficacy. An injection of a placebo saline solution, being invasive, gives an even stronger effect than swallowing 4 pills.Large pills seem to have greater effect than small pills.Capsules more effective than tablets.Many patients trust their doctors instinctively. They \u2018leave it to the doctor\u2019 to treat them, mildly interested in the medical processes.The very processes of conversation, consultation with a doctor also seem to be effective in relieving ill-health. The more elaborate and formalized the processes, the stronger the beneficial outcomes. ",

            "answer_text": "Homeopathy is a pseudo-science because it is necessary for conventional medicine to present it as such. Yet in order to be able to present it as a pseudo-science several important observable facts have to be strenuously avoided by those who support the pharmaceutical drugs industry. First. Homeopathy has been treating patients successfully for over 220 years, almost entirely without the financial support of governments. Homeopathic patients have this annoying habit of getting better, and so they return to homeopathy when they become sick again. Mention this and medical science cries in alarm - \u201cAnecdotal\u201d - \u201cUnscientific\u201d - \u201cPlacebo\u201d - et al. They do not want too many people to notice. Second. To support the idea that homeopathy is a pseudo-science, a therapy for which there is no scientific evidence, medical fundamentalists have to ignore a sizeable and growing number of scientific studies that have found homeopathy to be more effective than placebo, and/or pharmaceutical drugs. They don\u2019t meet some of the (usually spurious) scientific criteria imposed on research into homeopathy, criteria that (for some reason) don\u2019t apply to the testing of conventional medical treatment (which is known to be spurious, often dishonest, and sometimes outright corrupt). Scientific Evidence supporting the Effectiveness of Homeopathy as a Medical Therapy Conventional medicine is failing because its drugs and vaccines are proving to be both harmful and ineffective. This makes the supporters and beneficiaries of the pharmaceutical industry even more determined to undermine homeopathy. Their fervour increases the more they realise that fewer people are willing to submit themselves to their drugs, and instead are turning to homeopathy, and other natural therapies, for their health care. So homeopathy is indeed a pseudo-science - for anyone who does not have the wit or willingness to look critically, and compare the medical outcomes obtained by the two main medical therapies used throughout the world.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A.  Good question! Homeopathy could be the poster child for pseudoscience. Wikipedia lists the following as characteristics of Pseudoscience:  \"a claim, belief or practice presented as scientific, but which does not adhere to the scientific method... a use of vague, contradictory, exaggerated or unprovable claims; an over-reliance on confirmation rather than rigorous attempts at refutation; a lack of openness to evaluation by other experts in the field; and a general absence of systematic practices when rationally developing theories.\"  We can all agree that homeopathy presents itself as a science. That it does not adhere to the scientific method is for the below points to show. Homeopathy makes vague claims, with arguments that we don't know how it works, just that it does. Exaggerated claims have been made about homeopathy curing conditions that are generally considered incurable, chronic, etc. Excuses are made that render it unprovable one way or another - in homeopathy's case, the claim is often that they can't do RCTs as homeopathy is individualised. Over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation; a former homeopath who used the traditional method of refutation rather than confirmation  (Edzard Ernst) is now hounded by alt-med advocates  for actually doing science. The horror!Lack of openness to evaluation by others: governmental studies, systematic reviews, Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses is conducted by scientists are rejected again and again by homeopaths. Why?The unwillingness to apply conventional best-practice systematic approaches to homeopathy, as mentioned above - it just works and it is \"individualised medicine\" are used as excuses, and then RCTs and meta-analysis which do use systematic practices - but don't show homeopathy working - are, for some reason, ignored. This article lists further characteristics of pseudoscience:  It's dogmatic. Homeopathy starts with the principle that it works and research in the field tends to be seeking proof, rather than, as mentioned above, refutation. When dogma is challenged, as mentioned re Ernst, they are personally attacked, rather than embraced as testing the theory. The idea is aimed directly at the publicPharmaceutical medicine has to be tested and shown to work, passing a very high bar set by regulators and then pharma companies have to persuade doctors to prescribe most medicines by again proving they are better than the alternative. Homeopathy is aimed at the public, can be purchased unlicensed over the counter and has not had to pass this high bar. Ideas that are non-testable - see RCTs aboveVerbose language and prose / Conceptual hijackingThe use of verbose scientific-sounding language in a poorly-defined context, or hijacking of unrelated field. For example, \"energy\" and \"quantum\".Confirmation-bias (selective evidence) - see meta-analysis etc, above. Metaphorical/analogy driven thinkingSee \"quantum\", above. Also various analogies about vaccinations. But scientific arguments should be based on evidence, of course. Anecdotes as evidence\"It worked for my mum/my patient/etc.\" Then why doesn't it seem to work when tested? Anecdote isn't evidence. Lack of explicit mechanismsHow does homeopathy work again? I've never read any clear or explicit mechanism by which water could retain memory of a molecule it no longer contains, never mind how it could act in the body. Special pleading (elusive evidence) - see RCTs above, again. Conspiracy theorySee: claims that big pharma is somehow suppressing homeopathy.",

Is it a science that's not discovered yet. Science has already discovered many things like Presence of Oxygen. Do you think oxygen didn't exist before discovering.. Why are you talking like a baby? Actually Homeo mechanism hasn't been explained clearly by those doctors who popularized it. Those people( except doctors) who considered homeo medicine as water like substance they don't know about any other medicine except paracetamol , Zantac etc and even don't know their mechanism properly I think. So please use your unused brain. Every garbage question everyone is asking about Homeo just because they are seeing a BHMS doctor who don't have a proper BHMS degree..its because homeo medicine works on the basis of concentration effect those unauthorised BHMS doctors by reading just Materia medica uses those medicines to patients. Now tell me isn't it a very respectable job or very good source of Income? Be a doctor by reading just one or two books. Hopefully you'll understand BAMS (use of ancient and natural medicines and technology) and BHMS (use of natural and chemical medicines and technology) and MBBS (Advance medicine and technology) all are doctors. They are trained to treat patients and to cure diseases. I know many things in medical and medical realted stream need improvement. So Think wisely. ",

            "answer_text": "Homeopathy is not pseudoscience. It's quackery,pure and simple. Many people in this world take homeopathic remedies and claim that it has cured them. I once ate a guava and next day my fever went away,so that means guava made the fever go away\u2026\u2026NO. This is not how association and causation are established in medical science. The gold standard of today's medicine is evidence based medicine. There are certain criterias given by the great surgeon general of USA sir Bradford Hill that must be fulfilled to establish causation. 1)TEMPORAL ASSOCIATION Does the suspected cause precede the observed effect?A causal association requires that exposure to a putative cause must precede temporarily the onset of a disease which it is purported to produce to allow for any necessary period of induction and latency. For example-smoking and lung cancer. 2) STRENGTH OF ASSOCIATION Is there a dose-respone , duration-response relationship? As with the above example- number of cigarettes and relative risk of developing lung cancer. 3) SPECIFICITY OF ASSOCIATION One to one relationship between cause and effect. Various diseases are multi factorial in origin so this criteria may not always be satisfied. 4) CONSISTENCY OF ASSOCIATION Results are replicated in different settings and by different methods. 5) BIOLOGICAL PLAUSIBILITY Association agrees with current understanding of the response of cells , tissues,organs,and systems of stimuli. 6) COHERENCE OF ASSOCIATION Coherence with known facts that are relevant. The best way to establish whether a certain drug or organism or stimulus causes disease or treats it is to conduct a double blind randomised controlled trial. If you look carefully, homeopathic remedies turn the second criteria upside down.The more diluted the solution,the more will be it's effect and potency. It's highly illogical and unscientific. No RCT or peer reviewed journal has ever reported an effect of homeopathic remedies. It's a big big lie . ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s considered to be a pseudoscience by some traditional medical practitioners and scientists because there isn\u2019t enough data to support its benefits. But when you look at why there\u2019s not enough data, you can see where the fault in the theory lies. Just because there\u2019s no scientific data doesn\u2019t mean something doesn\u2019t work. There haven\u2019t been enough long-term studies with a sufficient number of people to support it\u2019s claims, which would lead to verification. And the reason for that is funding. There\u2019s not enough money available for those studies. And why is that? Because there is MUCH LESS money to be made by finding out that there are alternative and natural cures. Pharmaceutical companies sure don\u2019t benefit from competitive solutions and many doctors don\u2019t want to have to consider other options that will mean you don\u2019t need their diagnoses and drugs. Homeopathy also isn\u2019t a quick fix. It requires more thought and attention to the problem rather than treating a symptom, which many drugs do. I\u2019m not saying traditional medicine isn\u2019t valid - in fact it\u2019s crucial, but that same community should consider homeopathy as a highly supportive and preventative measure and pursue methods to find out the truth instead of running away from it and chasing the almighty dollar.

            "answer_text": "Homeopathy is never a pseudo-science. It can be proved before any authority with real experiments. It is based on the philosophical base. The present conclusion by most of the opponents lacks any real experience in Homeopathy too. The success of a medical administration depends on five factors, patient, doctor, medicine, and family members who are responsible for the administration of medicine, time. I have real experience in the homeo from my birth itself. On account of Homeopathy, my medical expenses are merely an immaterial thing in my life. Finding an accurate homeopathic medicine is very difficult. The points to be noted are follows. a) Due to lack of awareness, the patient may not tell all critical information about the personalities to the doctor. On account of the experience, the doctor can sense many things. If you provide a note about your personalities, motion, digestive fire, eyes, mental attitude, philosophical inclination, the tendency to hasty speech etc, there is the least chance to fail. You have to provide detailed information and ready to spend time with the homeopathic doctor for diagnosing the illness. b)There are more than hundred medicines for a particular type of illness. Finding exact and leading symptoms from many symptoms is the real task of the homeopathic doctor. c) It is effective in almost the majority of illness and 100% effective for deafness, problems related to eyes, digestive disorder, tonsillitis, intermittent fever, jaundice, malaria, viral fever, constipation, piles, thyroid, all types of skin diseases even if it is over forty years of existence. d) The illness may be acute or chronic. Chronic illness cannot be cured at all. It can only subside. Acute illness can be cured. e) Only home medicines from reputed companies have quality and there are many company products and some never have an impact on the body f) Now one can use SBL Company medicine and based on my use, all are excellent. Earlier Economic Homeo pharmacy products were top and not available All the articles opposing homeopathy is full of baseless articles. If anybody ready to challenge the validity of homeopathy, give a reference of ten cases and you find is incurable through allopathy. I will provide information and after administering the medicines, marked improvement can be seen. If you have itching for more than 10 years, a single dose of homeopathy can clear the illness. There are some preventive medicines in homeopathy on administering preventive medicine, within three months times, your hand will show a secondary lifeline. If your heart line is in chained position, that shows severe heart illness. On administering the medicines, that chained line will be tuned to a fine line. I could cure many cases which are noted as incurable and you can interview with the person to know the fact too. Read Kent philosophy at first, Samuel Hahnemann, Nash, Allen etc and administer in your body or you can administer for your pets and see the real results. It is equally effective for cows, goats, rabbit, cat, dogs etc. Homeopathy is the simplest possible medical administration in the world. Try to read the History of Homeopathy in Kerala, Calcutta, and in India too. Entire negative arguments in these sites are baseless. It is a fact that during fever, it cannot subside immediately. But through homeopathy, intermittent fever can be cured forever. This is 100% sure. If anybody failed to see the result, there may be six reasons, May have trouble in Kidney, 2) May have impurities in Blood, 3) May use inimical foods during the administration of the medicines, 4) incorrect finding of remedy, and 5) illness in an advanced stage which is beyond the capacity of medicine to cure, 6) poor quality of medicines manufactured without observing quality standards. Inform me the cases of deafness without surgical intervention, the solution can be provided. ",

It would be perfect, if the coppers raid your stash and test the goods all they will see is water yet it gets you high. Obviously this has not happened. Homeopathy is a very dangerous load of crap.

The same sort of rules that prevent clairvoyants from using their \u201cgift\u201d for self enrichment (except when there are fees involved). There is probably some \u201crule\u201d whereby the molecules, while gleefully ignoring Avogadro, KNOW that making Oxy is simply wrong.

Professor Paul Glasziou of Bond University recently headed a team of experts from the National Health and Medical Research Council who examined all the independent scientific trials of homeopathy. Their results were conclusive A total of 57 systematic reviews, containing the 176 individual studies, focused on 68 different health conditions - and found there to be no evidence homeopathy was more effective than placebo on any. 176 individual studies were conducted and not a single one of them found any evidence that homeopathy was effective in any way. That\u2019s as damning as scientific examination gets. That\u2019s game over, goodnight nurse, pack up and go home. The verdict is in. It\u2019s psuedoscience. But of course it will continue because people are getting rich of it. Something really needs to be done. If someone wants to pay money to a psychic who tells them that their dead relatives love them then I think they\u2019re wasting their cash but it\u2019s their own business and their right. But people shouldn\u2019t be able to falsely advertise a product as having medicinal properties when science has proven time and time again that they\u2019re not telling the truth.

Quantitive medicine can only suppress the disease but the Homeopathic remedies can offer complete cure by removing the cause of the disease. Single remedy system of Homeopathy can correct the madness of people who know nothing about it but take the first available opportunity to criticise the system. It can correct the madness and set the mind alright. It would like to advice to remain limited to the comment. The remedies are powerful enough to offer cure. The remedies offer cure only if used correctly, the misuse will harm beyond imagination and over use will kill. Homoeopathy maintains that treating disease by directly opposing their symptoms, as is done in conventional system of medicine, is ineffective.This is because all diseases can generally be traced to some latent, deep seated, underlying chronic or inherited tendency. The underlying miasmas remain in the body, even after conventional treatment and the deep seated elements can be corrected only by deeper disturbance or correction of  the vital force. Homoeopathy attracts controversy because there is no medicine present in the Homoeopathic preparation after a certain succession. The science requires at least one molecule of a medicine to be called a medicine. No medicine in the  medicine is not a medicine. But more importantly experiments have have already demonstrated that remedies have biological effects and do differ from water or spirit. Long live the name of Dr. Hahnemann, the discoverer.

In the quality assurance world we talk of this as \u2018triangulation\u2019. In the first place we have a long track-record of documented effectiveness in clinical practice over 200+ years. Hardly any pharmaceutical medicines have this. But in addition, there is a large and growing body of studies in the peer-reviewed literature, covering: basic researchrandomized controlled clinical trials.The evidence base has been well summarised here: Research - The Faculty of HomeopathyThe database of basic research maintained by the Carstens Foundation here: HomBRex databaseAIH Guide to Homeopathic Research - includes a bibliographic paper on the scientific framework for homeopath with 5,000 references: https://homeopathyusa.org/uploads/Research/lmhi2015.pdfI challenge anyone to name a pseudo-science that has a comparable body of scientific literature behind it. Anyone who makes a pronouncement on this topic before impartially reviewing the research is clearly guilty of prejudice (definition: making up your mind beforehand). Declaring homeopathy a pseudo-science is what the philosophers would call a category error. Putting homeopathy in the same category as creationism or astrology cannot be justified in the light of the body of scientific work listed above. ",

            "answer_text": "Homeopathy a pseudoscience , what does this actually means, do you intend to know that science itself falls on criteria of Falsifiability ie it is not complete and required continuous addition, evolution far from complete, same is with lots of scientific dictums ,take concept of 3D reality where by space time is taken as pivots ,the fourth relative ie time has no physical true meaning and do not exist as actual relative since it do not exist in quantum reality,clock just measure temporal sequence of events in quantum space, In improvised general relativity & special relativity,ie advanced relativity , the fourth constant is not time but rate of velocity changes or the movement of motion in 3 D quantum vacuum, time may be only temporal summation of change of motion or elementary particles in superfluid quantum vacuum, this speaks of lots leak holes in Relativity Einstein view which is far from physical real existence ,concept of advanced relativity is trying to keep the mass energy equivalence principle close to actual real experience , thus AR which has opened new realms of understanding physics has taken into cognisance of observers consciousness also into making of standard model in physics to explain true space time matter concept ,thus consciousness which is true intelligence of observation takes into perspective of physical object. Physical space ,inner mind, physical space thus now somewhere nearing to nature we have stumbled on human experience ,consciousness and space time reality as major event which has made us to understand lots of happening in universe which could not be explained. Such as mass energy annihilation, evolution of life, much considered God particle has been proven as pseudoscience, Higher goals on science has arrived where by universal consciousness ,individual consciousness all are not different but extension of one and whole,n dimensional Hilbert space as explained by A Sorli 2016 human brain perceives through biophotons of lower dimensions in Hilbert space ,where by n dimension of Hilbert space Is consciousness ,lower dimension further takes forms of matter of lower vibration,Biophoton is considered as Hilbert space of lower vibration and are in brain microtubules and whole living organism homeostasis comes from it,will be very soon established reality,but yes not from present scientific models which intend to shrink and fit everything in its fix module ,it do not involve human perception ,experience as any criteria as for now,many phenomenon are not explained by this model now any more ,\u2018Experiental model\u2019 of scientific doctrine will soon be the reality where by experience by observer need be important part to reproduce reality , many of scientific models will be obsolete as enumerate din above answers by my so many friends . Presence human consciousness,super consciousness, annihilation and formation of antiparticle and particles in reduced state of quantum vacuum of variable energy density. When we talk of waves of infinite frequency and zero wave length, we talk of consciousness, thus we may speak further it is possible to connect intuitively to physical reality of another human mind and may be very explained by progressive science of near future, ultradilution or dynamisation in homeopathy will be smaller reality of AR as a guidance, when we talk of wave, we don\u2019t talk of weight which appears by variable energy density of space,so negative weight or negative energy are false physically, particle and wave exist in true 3D quantum vacuum as irrevocable reality, So diluting substance beyond Avogadro number reality and negative or nihilistic concentration as one today\u2019s v/v science will be myth. As of now so called scientific gentry may use whatever comes to their today\u2019s understanding of scientific principles which validates or not ,but with which we have done our primary to secondary and tertiary education, but still keep mind open to accept reality even today\u2019s model may find incompetent to hold its truth, let\u2019s work earnestly to open up new avenues to understand how in experience homeopathy exist ,but science requires some advancement to hold it in arms.,till then topic is wide open for so called sceptic and alternative science proponents . Science propagates through refutation of false claims and not by scientific dogmas, no system is far from its shortcomings whether it is principles or application. ",

I would tell you that Homeopathy isn't a pseudo-science at all.Homeopathy is the second most used system of medicine in the world and yet it is not understood by science. You have to be aware that Homeopathy is a different approach from the \"modern\"system of medicine. Homeopathy is mostly preventive and requires a certain lifestyle to be able to trigger responses from your immune system. I would advice you to read more about the origins of Homeopathy to make up your mind. here is an example: http://blogsnorestop.com/2015/04/09/a-quick-introduction-to-homeopathy/  Some People will tell you that there is no molecule of the original product left in the final formula and therefore it proves that homeopathy can not work.I think that science doesn't answer all of our questions yet and there is still a lot to discover.  Good luck in your researches. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. Science is just careful observation of how the nature works. If we know or does not know how a phenomenon works, it does not mean that it is not there or it does not work. Homeopathy is also a careful observation of the diseased state of the person. Now I will quote an example from a homeopathic case that I cured. Homeopathic medicine Lycopodium has a symptom that disease is aggravated between 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM. I cured a case where fever will come between 4 PM stay until 8:00 PM and the patient was fine for the rest of the 20 hours of the day. Fever didn\u2019t yield to modern medicine. Now, science may or may not be able to understand this phenomenon why disease is aggravated or ameliorated between particular hours and how does Lycopodium eradicates such disease from the root; but this remains a fact. Disease may be any, it may be pain, fever, angina or anything, it does not matter. Who is going to pay for scientific experiments such as double blind studies in homeopathy. Moreover, for the same disease, homeopathic medicine will be different for different patients. Then how will you conclude the study? It is the talk of the town that Homeopathy does not have a single molecule of the original medical substance and is just water or alcohol, but how about lower potencies of medicines that have molecules? Only people who do not have any first hand experience with homeopathy say it is pseudoscience. ",

A field, practice, or body of knowledge can reasonably be called pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the norms of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms. Homeopathy is considered a pseudoscience because it\u2019s all that. It\u2019s based on notions which make no sense, proposes no credible method of action and has never been shown to do anything more than act as a placebo. Specifically, though, it\u2019s a pseudoscience because its proponents and practitioners claim it\u2019s science. It\u2019s not science. ",
