Of this I am sure, losing doesn\u2019t make a person a loser, and winning doesn\u2019t make a person a winner. The only difference between a winner and a loser is attitude. ATTITUDE: A predisposition or a tendency to respond positively or negatively towards a certain idea, object, person, or situation. Attitude influences an individual's choice of action, and responses to challenges, incentives, and rewards. Four major components of attitude are: Affective: emotions or feelings.Cognitive: belief or opinions held consciously.Conative: inclination for action.Evaluative: positive or negative response to stimuli.",
