            "answer_text": "Briefly, in order,\u2026No yes yes yes. But you could gave looked it up in a solubility table like I did. Obviously you are asking Quora to answer your Chem homework for you! It is a worthwhile rule to remember that \u201cbasically\u201d all metal oxides are alkali. This is because their oxide ion readily reacts with protons\u2026 H+. In fact MgO is alkali, as it will dissolve in acid if not neutral water. A more interesting answer is to note that both metals are group 2 in periodic table that one oxide is quite insoluble (MgO) in water compared to that one period heavier (CaO). Ask why? This has to do with bond stability or strength. Or that all the soluble chemicals in this list are less soluble in hot than cold water! Why? This has more to do with the effect of entropy and free energy. That discussion may be best described in University chemistry course, but fascinating either way. ",

            "answer_text": "One by one: MgO is insoluble in water, Mg(OH)\u2082 and Ca(OH)\u2082 dissolve very little (the latter slightly more than the former), and CaO dissolves because it actually reacts with water to form an aqueous solution of Ca(OH)\u2082: CaO(s) + H\u2082O(l) \u2192 Ca(OH)\u2082(aq) According to these ideas, only Ca(OH)\u2082 is an alkali because it is the only base that is soluble in water (to a certain extent). P.S. The reaction above is actually an equilibrium. ",
