            "answer_text": "This is a single displacement reaction\u2026 Based in the Reactivity Series: Potassium Sodium Aluminum Calcium Magnesium Aluminum Zinc Iron Tin Lead Hydrogen Copper Silver Gold Platinum Zinc is more reactive than copper and so it will displace the copper from the copper nitrate and become zinc nitrate and leave copper on it\u2019s own. This will give a blue solution with a reddish-brown precipitate which is the displaced copper particles. Equation: Zn + Cu(NO3)2 \u2192 Cu + Zn(NO3)2  ",
