            "answer_text": "Considering a charge positive or negative is a convention. Maybe, the person who discovered charge for the first time, named it as positive. And the opposite charge is then named negative. Atomic nucleus is positively charged is proved by Rutherford in his gold foil experiment. Alpha particles(helium nuclei) which is highly positively charged are made to pass through gold foil. These alpha rays only deflect when they will found like charge or +ve charge. This resulted in discovery of nucleus as a small positively charged sphere in centre of atom . ",

            "answer_text": "Great Question! for a long time all people knew was there was a positive charge somewhere in the nucleus, mixed in with the negative charges like fruit cake or plum pudding  anyways Rutherford wanted to test the idea there was a core to atoms so what he did was he put some radioactive material in a lead box with a little hole so that a stream of positive alpha particles came out in a line then put some gold foil in front of the stream, and waited to see if anything got deflected  most of the positively charged alpha particles just went straight through with maybe a slight deviation, but one in every 8000 bounced straight back. based on this Rutherford was able to calculate the approximate size of the nucleus based on how many went in and how many bounced back ",
