            "answer_text": "1) Well, obviously, RQM brings the concepts of relativity into the game. Indeed, (non-relativistic)QM, and so Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is not embedded into a 4D space-time. But this is important to account for phenomenom at large speed (v/c). The Schr\u00f6dinger equation actually respects all standard Galilean transformation when changing the reference frame of the observer, and so do not respect Lorentzian transformation. (Historically, I think Schr\u00f6dinger started looking for a relativistic wave equation, but ended up with its more simple \"newtonian\" one. Even experimentally, people quickly noticed the importance to move to a relativistic version of the theory, in particular due to the high speed relativistic effects of electrons in atoms,etc. Famous wave equations that respect 4d spacetime are: Maxwell's equations (useful for vectorial=spin 1 field); Dirac's equations (useful for spinorial = spin 1/2 fields); and Klein-Gordon's equations (useful for scalar = spin 0 fields). You may also have a look at \"Yang-Mills\" fields fur further considerations ...) 2) But apart from the (v/c) relativistic speed effect that needed to be taken into account correctly, another big game changer came from the famous E=mc\u00b2 relation, together with the quantum relation [math]E=h {c \\over{\\lambda}}[/math]. People realized that, to look at things at smaller and smaller scales [math]\\lambda[/math], they had to go for larger and larger energy scale [math]E[/math]. But, at a certain point, when your light beam gets close to the mass-energy scale of the electron (for example), instead of looking at small things, you actually start creating disturbing electrons from your light beam. And indeed, this is what happens, but this phenomenon was not explained in standard QM. (What happens is that for high energy photons, you have a high quantum probability that this photon turns into a pair of electron-positron). So relativity implies a non-conserved number of particles, which is not the case for QM. And it also does imply the creation of particles for energy close to their mass-energy scale. This phenomenon is very important because it actually states that interactions at a fundamental level are understood as particles transforming into one another, which is much more subtle concept than the \"action-reaction forces\" from Newtonian view (still used in classical relativity and QM). This is all well defined in the formalism of QFT (quantum field theory). 3) The other very important thing that come with relativity is the loss of simultaneity of events for different observers. This is a very well known results from classical relativity and its spacetime structure: For 2 events A and B that are \"space-like\", we know that one observer can see A happening before B, and reciprocally for some other observer, B can be seen happening before A. It actually predicts the need of having anti-particle in the theory to ensure its coherence. Let's consider the famous radioactive decay of a neutron into a proton, together with an electron and its partnering neutrino. We have the following: [math]n^0 \\to p^+ + e^- + \\nu[/math] We know that this decay happens thanks to the weak nuclear force, through the exchange (or transformation) of a particle called the \"[math]W[/math]\". But as an observer, we have two equivalent ways to look at this decay. Observer 1:  This first observer see the neutron transforming into a proton and [math]W^-[/math], and then see the [math]W^-[/math] transforming into the electron and its neutrino. So for Obs.1, you start with the Neutron, then, event A = proton appears (Neutron disappears), then event B = Electron and Neutrino appears. Actually, you never measure anything about the W. You know what you start with, you know what you end with, but you don't see what's in between. You just need it for calculus. Observer 2:  But we can consider this second observer, from a space-like distance, actually seeing first a spontaneous creation of a pair of Electron and Neutrino together with a [math]W^+[/math], and only then, seeing the [math]W^+[/math] combining with the Neutron to form a Proton. So for Obs.2, you start with Neutron as well, then event B = Electron and Neutrino appears, then event A = Proton appears (Neutron disappears). Similar to Obs.1, you never have a look at the W in between. This is important because, both observer started with just a Neutron, and ended up with the same particle content: proton + electron + neutrino. But for observer 1, due to charge conservation, it used a [math]W^-[/math] to describe the process, while the other one had to used a [math]W^+[/math]. And because both events are the same, the W particle used in the description of the phenomenon have to be the same one, same mass, same characteristics, expect for its charge that is opposite. This way, we can understand why relativity, when applied to quantum interactions with particles creations and transformations does imply the existence of anti-particles. It allows to respect all observers' point of view. 4) Last thing, but much more subtle and complex, so I will not go into details, is the prediction of the \"spin statistic theorem\". Basically, when you have to deal with \"spins\" in QM, you need to add a principle to the theory that is the \"Pauli exclusion principle\". When going to RQM (more precisely, to Quantum Field Theory), the Pauli principle is no more an ad-hoc principle, but a consequence of the formalism, very link to imposing a causal theory on quantum fields. That's it for the main changes IMO. ",

            "answer_text": "That's really a nice question to think about, in order to appreciate the notion of a (relativistic) quantum field (theory) and to motivate its necessity for constructing a relativistic generalization of quantum theory. So, of course, the fundamental difference between RQM (relativistic quantum mechanics) and NRQM (non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the ordinary Schrodinger-style quantum mechanics) is the consequence of the \"relativistic\" nature of the mechanics of the former over the latter. Now, what are the implications? From Einstein's Theory of Relativity we learn that in a relativistic setting, mass and energy are equivalent (Yes! You got it... that [math]E=mc^2[/math] thingy!). Therefore, (in relativistics limits, that we're here concerned with) the idea of a 'fixed number of particles' or a 'single particle' no longer holds, since matter and energy are interconvertible into each other (in such limits). Once you realize this, it immediately follows that there could be no trivial relativistic extension of the (non-relativistic, one-particle) Schrodinger equation. Such a theory will not be self-consistent, simply because at such relativistic speeds (or equivalently, high energies) a single particle with sufficiently high energy could convert into many particles or vice-versa. So, in principle, such possibilities exist and consequently we fail to construct a consistent RQM. What we need is a broader and a more robust framework than NRQM/RQM which allows us to have the possibility of having any number of particles. This is the basic difference between the quantum theory and its relativistic generalization. This naturally leads us to (relativistic) quantum field theory (QFT). ",
