            "answer_text": "Consider your abilities compared to that of a computer algebra system. In terms of raw computational  abilities, the very best first year calculus students rarely exceed the abilities even of MAXSYMA (the first one), widely available as the open-source program maxima.  But that is \"raw computation\", a problem already specified in abstract symbols. \"Understanding maths\" as you put is figuring out the connection between real-life problems presented in words and these raw computations. So for instance, most high-school students can solve two linear equations in 2 variables. But if a word problem is presented that in the end requires solving the same equations, that may be a much harder proposition, because the meaning of the equations is not known either by MACSYMA or a students with only weak understanding. To my mind as an experienced educator, if you can at least determine that a certain volume problem in second-semester calculus requires a certain difficult integral, then you have achieved most of what we can expect of you.   You can then feed that integral into various symbolic engines (equivalent  to a four-place calculator for simple arithmetic) to get a \"real\" answer.  Of course we expect you to be able to solve simple integrals, but unlike differentiation, there is not always an answer even to quite simple questions, at least in terms of the functions you have been taught so far. So the answer to your question is meaning. Create a parallel track between words and meaning in analyzing all situations. Simple example:  Alice is four years older than Jane ==> A = J + 4 The beauty of algebra and calculus (and more advanced  techniques) you can state your facts in simple symbols right off  the page, and wait until later to combine them to extract inferences. So in calculus classes, we teach students a wide variety of fairly simple techniques to find the derivatives of functions.  But to students derivative is a strange term without prior meaning.  However, calculus classes are supposed to be taught in conjunction to physics classes where  the connection between position and velocity, and between velocity and acceleration (in each case the second is the derivative of the first) should be explained, but usually isn't quite made clear because calculus is not a  requisite of first-year or high-school physics. In short, look into the real-world interpretations of real-world things. Apart from physics, economics also provides an example of mathematical reasoning. Human memory is tied to words and meaning.  Strings of symbols in a calculus textbook will rarely capture your imagination but applications to real things might. ",

            "answer_text": "Find a mentor, or several math people you can check in with, who can answer your questions and tell you what subjects might either help you understand better, or might fire your curiosity.Read math books. Read good math books. If you don\u2019t understand things, that\u2019s fine. Very few of us understand everything we read. Expose yourself to the core ideas in these books, and if a book doesn\u2019t explain its subject in a way you understand, find another book that explains it better to you. Read Wikipedia articles and nLab articles and Mathworld articles. Read math books from 50\u2013100 years ago and see how they understood the ideas you are studying (if they existed back then, which most of them did, at least in some form).Play with the concepts you are learning. Your goal is to make these concepts yours, and they won\u2019t be yours until you have played with them. Give yourself problems to solve. Ask questions and try to answer them. Take ideas you think you already know and test yourself to see if you fully understand them.Find out what the physicists think of the ideas you are studying. Try to find some of the math you are learning in physics books and see how it is presented in that context.Learn something about the history of math. Read Euclid, Cardano, Descartes, Newton, and others. See how the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Arabs and Renaissance Europeans thought about mathematics.Learn linear algebra. Every math subject there is uses linear algebra, and there\u2019s always more linear algebra to learn.Do not shy away from learning differential equations, both ODEs and PDEs. People who refuse to learn differential equations at least on a basic level (and there\u2019s a lot of them in pure mathematics) never really understand mathematics on a global, conceptual level.At some point, make your peace with category theory, and strive to understand what universal means. The sooner you learn what a universal mapping property is, and what a universal cover is, the more concepts are opened up to you.",
