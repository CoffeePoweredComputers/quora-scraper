            "answer_text": "If someone from 1918 could use a time machine and jump forward to 2018, the world would be completely unrecognisable. Sunlife has released a super interesting infographic which covers some of the ways life has changed in the last 100 years. In the early 1900s, the only real way people could communicate was via letter. If you were sending a letter within the country, this could be received within a day. But if you were sending a letter to the other side of the world, you could expect it to take up to 10 weeks. By 1910, telegrams were all the rage, and messages could be sent within 4 minutes. This connected the world in a way it had never been connected before. But 1915 saw the invention of the telephone, which had to be connected via operators (and could take up to 23 minutes to connect). Next in line was the mobile phone and fax. Email was invented in the 1960s, but didn\u2019t gain popularity until the 1970s.By 2010, instant messaging and WhatsApp changed the world. They\u2019ve completely revolutionised the way we communicate- even with people on the other side of the world. Of course, it\u2019s not just communication that has undergone a massive evolution. Simply talking to your grandmother about how dating was done \u201cin her day\u201d will make it obvious that dating is a completely different ballgame in 2018. Back in the 1900s, parents had the biggest say in who you were going to date. They would approve of a man based on his calling card and status. They\u2019d then chaperone any meetings. Parents had to give permission for dates, and couples had to appear in public places. By the 1920s, dinner dates were happening, and women could go on these without a chaperone. By the 1960s, couples could spend much longer alone together. Public displays of affection were popular, and couples would \u201chang out.\u201d By 1990s, online dating became a popular way to meet people. Of course, now, dating apps rule the dating world. While this is convenient, it\u2019s also much easier to swipe left based on small \u201cflaws\u201d without getting to know someone. Even photography has changed, with Kodak selling the first widely affordable camera in the early 1900s. By 1910, the 35mm film was invented, and is still used today. 100 years later, Instagram was born. This app has more than 500 million users each month, making it easy for us to share everything from selfies to travel snaps- all taken from our smartphones. ",

Civilizations started forming around 8000 years ago as per present research.
