            "answer_text": "I\u2019m just editing a grad level text on this question. The 3 proposed valence quarks in a proton account for 1% of the mass-energy and anywhere from 2\u201320% of the spin. This extends to all baryons. The other 99% of the mass of the proton, whose mass is known with 99.99999% certainty, accuracy, and precision, is proposedly via the Uncertainty Principle, from which particle-antiparticle pairs, the Strong Force, and so on arise, according to the Standard Model, confined within a 1 femtometer diameter region. this is inexplicable and simply referred to as the \u2018bag model,\u2019 of quark confinement. The universe has a critical density that must be 1 out to about 60 decimal places, or the universe would already have expanded away to heat death or re-collapsed by now. The measured value is less than 1% of that. Since we cannot account for more than 99% of the mass-energy of the universe, because we only have hyopotheses where the mass of the nucleon comes from, 99% of the mass-energy of the proton, we exist in violation of that 19th century hypothesis from a subatomic out to cosmological scales. We therefore come up with more \u2018hypotheses\u2019 which are neither provable or disprovable to account for that, in order to preserve a 19th century edict. none occur in observable dimensionalities. Susskind added the -1 law of thermodynamics, \u2018information cannot be destroyed.\u2019 This is in response to the \u2018information paradox.\u2019 The paradox is that information has yet to be defined, and falling into a black hole is impossible, since time dilation makes such asymptotic. LIGO detection of graviry waves proves that frame of reference does not apply to general relativity. Wheeler wrote in Gravitation, the text, that p873, the astronauts never reach the black hole in their own frame of reference, there is no preferential frame of reference in GR. he cites hawking, and dismisses him. there is nothing even in Quantum Theory as stated by the founders of Quantum Theory that hasn\u2019t been turned upside down, with only 3 exceptions 1) Pythagorean\u2019s Theorem, 2) only time dilation of Special Relativity, 3) General Relativity is a bit shaky at this time, but that is because people do not understand what \u2018the geometry of space-time\u2019 means, nor for that matter, what either space or time is. Every other thing has been tossed, or in most cases ignored. there are literally one billion pages of hypotheses in quantum theory, and nothing has evolved since the transistor, 1947. ",

            "answer_text": "In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle (also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, such as energy E and time t, can be known. See Uncertainty principle and  \u201cQuantum mechanics [therefore] states that, on a very, very tiny scale and for very, very, very short lengths of time, energy can be spontaneously \u2026 created and destroyed. Kind of like boiling water, where bubbles spontaneously appear and burst, energy - in the form of [particle pairs] - can spontaneously appear from the {non empty vacuum} of spacetime, exist for a tremendously short amount of time, and disappear again. On normal time and length scales, this all averages out to what thermodynamics says should be true (that no energy is created or destroyed within the closed system of the universe). But this does mean that, if there was such a tiny fluctuation at the beginning of time, it could have made the total energy of the universe at creation slightly more than zero, and thus the universe will always contain that total amount of energy\u201d See in Ask a Physicist Answers (The total energy of the universe has been calculated to be near zero. See Norman Simenson's answer to Our universe has tremendous gravitational potential energy. Since an input of energy is required to produce a state of potential energy, what would induce a quantum fluctuation of that much energy, especially if the universe is infinite? ) (The Heisenberg uncertainty relation states: delta E x delta t >= h/4pi i.e., that the uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is greater than or equal to Planck\u2019s constant divided by four times pi. Interpreted correctly, this means that it is possible to violate conservation of energy given you do it for a very short time. In other words, it is possible \u201cto borrow\" energy E from \"nowhere\", given that you return it in a time period t, where t is given by t ~ h/E ) This spontaneous creation of energy at the quantum level for the briefest of times is nominally unmeasurable (it is postulated that any variation that changes the action by an amount less than h/4pi cannot be observable )\u2014 so is deemed \u2018virtual\u2019\u2014 NOT \u2018real\u2019. But, it does affect events at the quantum level, so is NOT imaginary! However, since everything averages out in the end, the law of conservation of energy is not violated.
