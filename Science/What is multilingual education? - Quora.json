            "answer_text": "Multilingual Education typically refers to \"first-language-first\" education, that is, schooling which begins in the mother tongue and transitions to additional languages. Typically MLE programs are situated in developing countries where speakers of minority languages, i.e. non-dominant languages, tend to be disadvantaged in the mainstream education system. There are increasing calls to provide first-language-first education to immigrant children from immigrant parents who have moved to the developed world.  STRONGER FOUNDATION  Children whose early education is in the language of their home tend to do better in the later years of their education STRONG BRIDGE \u201cStrong Bridge\" - an essential difference between MLE programs and rural \"mother tongue education\" programs is the inclusion of a guided transition from learning through the mother tongue to learning through another tongue. Related to the emphasis on a child's mother tongue is the implicit validation of her cultural or ethnic identity by taking languages which were previously considered \"non-standard\" and making active use of them in the classroom. Multilingual Education in that sense underscores the importance of the child's worldview in shaping his or her learning. Hope it Helps. Dream Builder Yash Gorani Editor : GirlAskGuys .com ",

            "answer_text": "Multilingual education is still difficult to understand, as it breaks paradigmas and even the definition of language itself. However, it is important to be addressed, as it is already reality in some countries and the trend is that it will be in many countries in the near future. More and more, the classrooms are very heterogeneous, with children speaking one, two or three languages at home and learning others at school. A multilingual education is the one that values the home languages and builds on them to introduce others, instead of erasing/deleting the other(s), minoritary language(s). Luxembourg, for example, has a multilingual education. The school system focus on four languages (the three official languages of the country + English) while 49% of the children in the classrooms have a migratory background, many times speaking one or more languages at home that is/are different from those learned at school. There are specific pedagogies for using the children\u2019s home languages in the classroom to help these children make sense of the new languages being learned. The teachers also compare languages, present texts in more than one language, or ask the children to read in one language and explain in another one, for example. ",
