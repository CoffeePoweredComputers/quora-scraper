            "answer_text": "Definitely.  Our Sun orbits around the center of our Galaxy owing to our Galaxy's gravitational pull.  Our orbital speed is about 220 km/s, and we will complete one full orbit in about 250 million years. The escape velocity from our Galaxy is about 600 km/s.  This is still well faster than the fastest spaceship ever launched by humans, which is the New Horizons mission to Pluto, which after a gravity assist is now hurtling at a mere 45 km/s.   But the escape velocity isn't actually that large, it's only about 0.2% the speed of light.  In the future one could imagine using light sails or something to get to such speeds.  Of course it would still take a very, very long time to actually leave our Galaxy. ",

            "answer_text": "You say \"to escape it\" but the 'it' could be the gravitational field, or the galaxy. If a spaceship traveled 'up' from the galactic arm it need not go out to the edge of the galaxy. As soon as it was traveling at the local arm escape velocity, you could say it had escaped the galaxy. As for escaping the gravity? Nope. The Milky Way's gravity is affecting other galaxies millions of light years away. ",
