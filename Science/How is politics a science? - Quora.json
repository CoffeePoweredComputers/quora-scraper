            "answer_text": "I\u2019d like to give a different perspective from the non Anglo-American, \u201ccontinental\u201d understanding of \u201cscience\u201d in general and political science in particular. in Germany (and many other European countries), we traditionally understand the term science in a much broader sense than the Anglo-Saxon countries: a science according to this understanding is , as Kant wrote: \u201cany teaching, if it possesses a system, that is, a totality of knowledge structered according to certain principles, can be called a science.\u201d ( Kant, Metaphysische Anfangsgr\u00fcnde der Wissenschaft, preface). This definition leaves much space for both empiricist and non-empiricist viewpoints of science ( Kant was known for his stand for the existence of a priori knowledge, not related to sensual perception of \u201cfacts\u201d outside the human mind). The German word for science, Wissenschaft definitely has this broader meaning, as visible in hard-to-translate terms such as Geisteswissenschaften (\u201csciences of the mind\u201d, humanities) . One can criticize this as useless idealism, however it shaped the thought of generations of German and Central European thinkers to come. In strong contrast to this, the modern English term \u201cscience\u201d was so influenced by Anglo-Scottish empiricism and later scientific positivism, that it almost exclusively holds the meaning of natural science, or any science that uses the methods developed in and for natural science. So, as one can see, whether one classifies political science among the sciences, entirely depends on the definition of the term science. There was, at least since the times of Descartes and Thomas Hobbes, a strong tendency to shape political thought towards the scientific method and make it a science more geometrico. However, this never fully succeeded, and there is a strong non-positivist tradition on the European continent, both the ontological-normative school shaped by Heidegger and the Freiburg school, as well as the neo-Marxist Critical theory of the Frankfurt school ( Adorno, Habermas and the likes ). Both aren\u2019t opposed to mathematical and natural science methods per se, but differ from the positivists in using textual, hermeneutical, and qualitative methods as well. There even was a rather famous \u201c\"method struggle\u201d between Popper and his pupils on the one side and the Frankfurt school on the other, on whether scientific positivism fits the social sciences or not. So, to conclude, politics, or political thought, is certainly a science in the above broader sense of the term. however, if it limits itself to the methods of natural science only, it will always be looked down and frowned upon by members of the \u201charder\u201d, more exact natural sciences. Rather, it should push for a methodological pluralism, to safeguard its unique position between the natural sciences and humanities. ",

            "answer_text": "Is politics a science? No. For something to be a science you must be able to follow the scientific method to learn and correct things. The scientific method is something that should be taught in schools but it isn't, which is why there is so much ignorance about science in the world today. Here it is: Hypothesis. Propose a hypothesis. ...Experiment/Observe. Design and perform an experiment to test your hypothesis. ...Data/Analysis. Record observations and analyze what the data means. ...Conclusion. Conclude whether to accept or reject your hypothesis.So an example would be: Hypothesis - I think nothing will happen to the level of the water in this glass if I drop a stone into it.Experiment - Fill a glass with water, measure the height of the water in the glass, find a stone, carefully put it into the water, re-measure the height of the water in the glass.Data - Oh, the hight of the water went up!Conclusion - My hypothesis was wrong. When a stone is dropped in water it displaces a volume of water equal to the volume of the stone. Eureka! You've discovered displacement!You can't do that with politics because you are dealing with human beings, all acting and responding in different ways at different times. Lots of people try to make a science out of it but it never works out because what they observe today could very easily change tomorrow because of different, unpredictable circumstances. ",
