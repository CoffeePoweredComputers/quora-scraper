            "answer_text": "What are the chances that scientists bring something back to Earth from outer space that we will one day regret? Unless we are wrong in our assumptions of the Universe, that is, the human laws of physics apply everywhere else, then it is unlikely we will ever regret bringing back something evil or destructive (Alien). Of course we would have to be able to identify something that is living as we define it. If there are Sun monsters then we\u2019re doomed. Say there\u2019s an element on Bennu that is not in our list of 92. We could retrieve it and bring it back to Earth and upon exposure to oxygen would explode into a great conflagration that would cook our planet. That refers back to my first sentence. We just have to assume that our 92 elements are the only 92 elements in the entire Universe. Otherwise, we bring no samples back to Earth. It is evident that at the very least, the rest of our Solar System obeys our Earthly laws. How about the Titan lander Huygens? The fact that it landed and telemetered data back to Earth verifies that our analyses of Titan beforehand was correct and Huygens was not swallowed by some unknown force. Therefore, I\u2019m sure a sample of Titan\u2019s surface could be brought back to Earth and there would be no regret some time later. Edit: Michael Meyerstein made some interesting comments so I\u2019ve come back to expand my original answer. I really didn\u2019t answer the implication of the question which I now interpret as bringing back some life form such as a subterranean Martian bacteria or from Enceladus or any place in the Solar System that is thought to have sub-surface oceans. NASA has already thought of that to some extent. For instance, Apollo astronauts were quarantined for 3 weeks after splash down. Here\u2019s an article on that procedure. Apollo mission quarantine procedures I\u2019ll back off on my original answer and say there is a possibility of carrying bacteria back to Earth that could turn out to be dangerous. Think of the English and Spanish colonists bringing small pox to the New World where the Native Americans did not have immunity. Diseases were the greatest component of the genocide to follow. ",

            "answer_text": "Negligible! There are degrees of regret but I guess you mean something that is a threat to humanity rather than just a waste of effort. The first time we bring anything back from a new place in the solar system it will be done very carefully (but mistakes happen, eg. the Stardust canister breaking open on crash landing). Possible \u2018things\u2019 we might find somewhere in the Solar system : toxic chemicals : The limited amounts would only pose a very local threat.some strange life forms like plants or bacteria : If they escape it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019d be able to multiply on Earth. Alien bacteria would be harder to mop up, but very unlikely to infect Earth plants or life. (Unlike in The Andromeda Strain)some strange animate life forms : Also unlikely to survive on Earth, and fairly easy to mop up.an alien artifact : In the unlikely event that it\u2019s still operational it could be a sensor or a bomb. Don\u2019t bring it back to Earth until we\u2019re sure it\u2019s not a bomb.The ones we could worry about are the ones that get here by themselves :  ",
