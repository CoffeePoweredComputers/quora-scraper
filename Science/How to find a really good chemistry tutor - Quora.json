            "answer_text": "Hi Tamara, I am a chemistry tutor myself and have a tutoring company. Here are some ways to find a good chemistry tutor and make sure they are good: 1. Word of mouth. Ask your friends if anyone has had a really good chemistry tutor. This is a trustworthy source that works well most of the time. 2. Google and search online. Look at the reviews a tutor has. Feel free to contact a couple of tutoring companies and tutors and then choose among them. What questions to ask your tutor? I interview tutors often and here are the things you should be looking for in a good chemistry tutor: Experience. Ask how many years of experience a tutor has (usually 2 or more years is a good number). You can also ask for references if you want to speak to past clients (depends on your preferences, but not necessary in most cases).Educational background. I decided to tutor chemistry because I majored in chemistry in college. It\u2019s really great if the tutor majored in the subject he/she teaches or took many courses in it and did well.I would say the most important quality of a tutor is a caring and attentive nature as well as passion for tutoring. When you meet a great tutor you can tell how excited he/she is to tutor and how much care he/she puts into his work.Finally, ability to teach well. Some people are really good at excelling in classes themselves but not in being able to explain how to solve difficult problems in easy ways. I believe that with a great tutor even the most difficult concept can be made easy and fun.I hope you found this helpful. For more chemistry tips, please visit www.transformationtutoring.com ",
