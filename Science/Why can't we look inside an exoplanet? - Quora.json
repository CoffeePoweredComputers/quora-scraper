            "answer_text": "Q: Why can't we look inside an exoplanet? A: In most of the cases, the reason is that we only know that they exist because how the planet influences other things, like its host star. In some cases where we can observe the planet directly, it\u2019s because the surface is in the way. \u201cBut isn\u2019t that the case of our planets? How can we know what they look inside?\u201d I\u2019m glad you asked. That\u2019s because we don\u2019t actually look inside with our eyes. Instead, we listen and we sense. We listen to quakes, we sense the force of gravity and we even smell and taste the molecules near them. And we look at the surface. Then we take all that data and our knowledge of how the universe behaves, and try to figure out what could give the results we see. That way, we get an understanding of the inside of a planet. We can\u00a8t do that to exoplanets. If we see them at all, it is as a few pixels, not enough to get any clues from the processes inside. And they\u2019re so far away that it would take hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years using today\u2019s rocket technology to send a space probe there to look, sense, listen and taste for us.

            "answer_text": "Q: Why can't we look inside an exoplanet? Because they are far away? And technically speaking, we can\u2019t really much \u201clook inside\u201d even into our own planet. We can do measurements with instruments on the surface, and conclude a lot of things. Looking inside would only work if they\u2019d consist 100% out of transparent material\u2026 which they don\u2019t. The deepest hole ever drilled was a bit over 12 km, Earth\u2019s diameter is 12.756 km, radius = >6000 km. So we have \u201clooked into\u201d at one place 1/500\u2019s of the distance to the center.
