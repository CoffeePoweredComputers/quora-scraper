            "answer_text": "Depends who the \u201cyou\u201d is, and what form the skepticism takes. One Scientist or group of scientists expressing concerns over the claims of another scientist, with both sticking strictly to the facts, understanding that correlation is not causation, understanding the limits of statistical significance, and so on, is part of the scientific method, and part of the process of holding science to account. Anti-Vaxxers refusing to vaccinate their children on the basis of what is fortunately a statistically insignificant collection of hearsay cases, however tragic they may individually be, following the advice of a professionally discredited, dishonest, unethical, fraud like Wakefield, who was in any case financially interested in his own alternative vaccine, and never originally meant to question vaccination in general, is not the scientific method, and does not hold science to account. Sadly, in the eyes of such people, the refusal of scientists to believe their narrative rather than follow proper method indicates the failure of science rather than its success. ",

            "answer_text": "When I am skeptical of ANYTHING in the media - scientific information or anything else - my first impulse is to look up the information on several different websites to compare and contrast what each media outlet says on that topic. I evaluate the quality and trustworthiness of the media outlet providing the information. I might research the expert being quoted in the article. I might look up the subject on Wikipedia. And I might ask any friends who might have expertise in or knowledge of the topic being discussed. It is our responsiblity to question, analyze, interrogate, research, and evaluate - and to make up our OWN minds. Whether it concerns scientific topics or anything else. ",
