            "answer_text": "I have seen this \u201claw\u201d asserted again and again, but it is missing a crucial term. the law does Not, does NOT, state that \u201cenergy cannot be created/destroyed\u201d. The law cannot make such a universal claim. Science has no right to make such a widespread claim. the law states:- \u201cenergy is not NOW being created or destroyed\u201d. Energy is conserved as far as we can see NOW. science has absolutely no right to make claims about the actual creation of matter/energy. We can make claims only about what we see happening in front of us. Anything beyond that is breaking the rules of science. ",

            "answer_text": "You might not realise it, but you are relying on a result from Noether\u2019s theorem. This states that if time exhibits a continuous symmetry, then energy is conserved. This works fine while the initial conditions hold, but ceases to be applicable when they don\u2019t (such as the moment of creation, or the big bang, or whatever name you care to give it). So, Noether\u2019s theorem (and the first law of thermodynamics) cannot answer your question outside its specific range. ",
