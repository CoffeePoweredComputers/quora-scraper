            "answer_text": "Actually they become the fate of oxygen molecules forming water. The hydrogens and bonded NAD+or FAD+2 give their bonding electrons into respiratory electrons transport chain and when the electron passings through all the levels of respiratory chain for oxidative phosphorylation come to lower energy levels are gained by Oxygen molecule and the hydrogens released initially by NADH and FADH2 bond with same Oxygen to form water.

            "answer_text": "These ionic hydrogens come from the C6H12O6. When glucose breaks down creating 12 + H ions. These ions create the difference of potential to move electrons down the electron transport chain creating ATP as the electrons move down the hydrogen combines with the oxygen available to form water. The hydrogen winds up in the product. 6H2O ",
