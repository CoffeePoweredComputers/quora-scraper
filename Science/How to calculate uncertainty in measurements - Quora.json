            "answer_text": "A value, naked and alone, has no uncertainty. A stopped clock is exactly correct twice a day. Some values are defined. Such values usually arise from conversion formulas. Measured values have two kinds of uncertainty afaik. One is something intrinsic to the device, and may be annotated on it or its user guide and is a limit of \u201caccuracy\u201d. The other is more readily understood as an outcome of multiple measurements, in which the skill of the operator and other extrinsic factors lead to more than one reading, even for the same item (or the same circumstance) and has the term \u201cprecision\u201d. When a collection of values is averaged, one retrieves from the calculation, a \u201cprobably\u201d accurate result for one item, multiply measured, will be produced, with a result that is no better than the design of the instrument allowed and is often worse. More often, one is measuring members of a class of similar items that may be thought to be made by a uniform process, and typically, the technician is accomplishing an average of the multiple members, without establishing his/her bona fides with a \u201cknown\u201d example. Talk, talk, talk\u2026 an example may help.. 5c pieces, nickels, are ~3/4\u2033 diameter discs used as money. They often have the approximate mass of ~5 g. If we take a roll of nickels and weigh the first 10, we may get 4.8,4.9,5.0,4.8,4.7,4.9,4.9,4.8,4.9,4.9 for an average 4.86 g/nickel, with a sd of .08, so 68% of the readings should be between 4.78 and 4.97. The whole roll is often said to be 200 g, which equates to 5.00 g\u2019/nickel. If my estimate of sd is correct, the results of 10 nickels of normal distribution, should be 4.92\u20135.08 g, and the value of the mass of a nickel be 5.00 +/- 0.08 g If the sd is right, 95% of the measurements of nickels will be found between 5.00 +/- 0.16 g or 4.84\u20135.16 g This is how uncertainty is ascribed. If you have a roll of nickels, they will not be all new, so there will be another factor that changes the average: wear. ",

            "answer_text": "Every measurement has uncertainty associated with it. Even the best equipment has measurement uncertainty. In metrology, every measurement must be accompanied by a statement of measurement uncertainty to be complete. To attain the magnitude of the measurement uncertainty, one needs to prepare an \"uncertainty budget\", taking into account every source of uncertainty associated with that measurement. It is a little like hard tedious work. ISO/IEC 17025, the guide to the competence of testing and calibration laboratories, Cl 5.4.6.1 states: A calibration laboratory, or a testing laboratory performing its own calibrations, shall have and shall apply a procedure to estimate the uncertainty of measurement for all calibrations and types ofcalibrations.5.4.6.2 Testing laboratories shall have and shall apply procedures for estimating uncertainty of measurement. In certain cases the nature of the test method may preclude rigorous, metrologically and statisticalIy valid, calculation of uncertainty of measurement. In these cases the laboratory shall at leastattempt to identify the components of uncertainty and make a reasonable estimation, and shall ensure that the form of reporting of the result does not give a wrong impression of the uncertainty. Reasonable estimationshall be based on knowledge of the performance of the method and on the measurement scope and shall make use of, for example, previous experience and validation data. The following is a little technical, but here goes... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_uncertainty ",

            "answer_text": "It is based on the instrument used to measure. The uncertainty is what its name implies. The degree of confidence that you have read the instrument correctly. If you have a linear scale it can be read to at least the precision of the smallest division (on a rule or tape often that is 1 mm). However you will usually be able to make out whether it is in the space or on the line. Then it will be 0.5 mm. In many cases you will be confident to estimate to 1/5 of the smallest division or even 1/10. Sometimes a vernier scale is added to assist. If you have a digital scale then it is the size of the smallest number it can register. e.g. a mass balance which reads to 0.01 g has an uncertainty of 0.01 g. If you combine measurements to calculate a results there are more rules for that. ",

I remember that he followed the every bit of the processes to measure the position or the momentum. For example, in order to measure the position of an object, one can take a picture, then this imparts a certain amount of momentum of the photon to the particle inevitably. This causes the momentum uncertainty. I recommend you to follow the article. Or you just mean computational uncertainty in ordinary measurements?It will be given by the standard deviation, sigma. You can do the same experiments in multiple times. Then, you can calculate mean, standard deviation, et cetera by standard statistics. ",
