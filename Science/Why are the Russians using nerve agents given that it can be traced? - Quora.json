            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy are the Russians using nerve agents given that it can be traced?\u201d Thanks for asking. It maybe that the Russian intelligence agents had devolved to apes with strange and powerful weapons that they just have to try. From the time of Soviet build umbrella gun that shoots Ricin like in a James Bond movie. To morons that had lost the knowledge of guns and knives. Preferring tractable radiation in a tea cup and Nerve agents they found lying around from Soviet time. Or more likely someone is trying to frame them. The nerve agent was in fact Soviet and not Russian invented. So all former republics of the USSR knew how to make it. Three republics even joined NATO. So NATO knows how to make it. The formula was published in a book.  State Secrets: An Insider's Chronicle of the Russian Chemical Weapons Program. So now any one with the funding and skills can replicate it. The whole basis of British claim is that it was invented in Russia (seems the British do not know the difference between the USSR and RF) Did you know that the British assassinated the North Korean dissident and Brother of the North Korean leader? Well Kim Jong-nam was killed with VX nerve agent. VX was a British invention. So going by the British way of reasoning. The British killed him. Here are my list of suspects. Kiev Government (Ukraine ) They have the agent and know how to make it. They also have a big bone to pick with Russia. Georgia. However unlikely. They are in fact getting more economically closed to Russia. The British themselves. The agent did not have far to travel from where it may have been created. The same town hosts the UK military chemical research labs. Skripal was a spent useless asset that may still turn and inform on who his handlers were in the MI6. What more, people need something to forget the Brexit fiasco. As for Russians. They did not need him dead. If they did, he would have died in their prison and no-one will even notice he was gone Yes am speculating but so is the British government. ",

            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t know for a fact that \u201cthe Russians\u201d are using a nerve agent that can be traced, but we don\u2019t have a better explanation for what happened. Russian officials and media tried hard to come up with alternative explanations, but they could not think of anything better than to blame the UK for poisoning someone of value to the UK on the UK soil with a nerve agent that does not have any particular UK connections. I guess, Putin was too smart not to blame the Martians. In politics, many things are done for game-theoretic reasons, in other words, responding to something, trying to anticipate events, or trying to trigger a particular response. In particular, propaganda often works this way - it really does not matter how nonsensical their material may be, what matters is how people respond. In this particular case, the argument (to the West) is that Russia could not have done this because the effect is not in their favor. That\u2019s a rotten argument because Russia and the Soviet Union (whose heir Russia proudly is) made many historical mistakes. For example, Stalin stubbornly refused many independent and highly-credible warnings that the Nazi Germany would invade on June 22, 1941. Instead, he moved troops, tanks and planes, very close to the border, making them vulnerable to air raids and capture, which happened in spades (Stalin was apparently shocked for several days before he composed himself and addressed the nation). In modern times, Russia\u2019s relations with the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine are another example of massive shortsightedness. For example, Russia used to be the exclusive supplier of natural gas to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Ukraine, charging exorbitant prices and insisting on their monopoly. Now that Lithuania and Poland are operating LNG terminals, prices have dropped considerably. Ukraine reversed pipelines and is buying natgas from Norway and other countries, also forcing Russia to dramatically lower gas prices. Anyway, back to nerve agents. Given that the poisoning occurred shortly before the presidential elections, it probably served several goals. One was to warn the opposition not to upset the elections and not to question its legitimacy. The election wasn\u2019t particularly clean - Russian Observers Charge Fraud in Putin\u2019s Landslide Re-Election - so, there are many reasons to protest, just as 2011\u20132013 Russian protests after Putin\u2019s previous elections. At that time, opposition leaders were arrested quickly, but the legal proceedings were lengthy and messy. It is in Putin\u2019s best interests to prevent a repeat of those events. Given the somewhat unexpected development, where China approved 'president for life' change, Putin will now be tempted to push similar changes in the Russian Constitution. However, that would require a very strong mandate. Lo and behold, statistical analysis indicates massive fraud - Seeing 'Churov's Saw': Russian Researcher Says Putin May Have Received 10 Million Fraudulent Votes. This wouldn\u2019t be a huge change from [1205.0741] Statistical anomalies in 2011-2012 Russian elections revealed by 2D correlation analysis To summarize, the use of a traceable nerve agent can mean that Putin wanted to send a message to people like Skripal and their associates - we can kill you anywhere. That mission has been accomplished. Of course, for everyone else, Putin would like to have deniability. The British aptly called this state of things \u201cimplausible deniability\u201d. ",
