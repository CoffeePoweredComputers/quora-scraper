            "answer_text": "Will doubling velocity double kinetic energy? Answer: Kinetic Energy(KE) =  If you have a velocity say; 3 m/sec and you double it to 6 m/sec. This will happen: 3 = 9 m/s 6 = 36 m/s As you can see 9 : 36 is 1 : 4. So, doubling you velocity will increase the KE by four times. In other words Kinetic Energy is directly proportional to the square of the velocity. ",

            "answer_text": "Kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity.  Therefore, with change in velocity, Kinetic energy varies exponentially. Hence, doubling velocity would result into:     This proves, if you double the velocity, K.E becomes 4 times its initial value. ",
