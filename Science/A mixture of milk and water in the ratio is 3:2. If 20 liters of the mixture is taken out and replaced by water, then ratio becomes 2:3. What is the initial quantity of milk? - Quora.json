Total mix is 60 liters Verification: Once 20l removed then mix is 40lit . milk is 24lit and water is 16 lit When 20 lit water added then milk is 24 lit and water is 36 lit. So ratio is 2:3 . It matches . Initial quantity of milk is 36 liters ",

            "answer_text": "Let the initial Volume of milk-water mixture be=V Litres. The milk-water ratio=3:2. After removing 20 litres of the mixture and adding 20 Litres of water the ratio changes to 2:3. So (V-20) x 0.6= Vx0.4. Upon solving we get 0.6V-0.4V= 12. 0.2V=12. So V=60 Litres. So the initial quantity of milk was= 60 Litres ",
