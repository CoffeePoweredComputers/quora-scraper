            "answer_text": "Did you not get the idea of how to do this from my previous answer. There is a general principle involved. Take the heat of reaction for the reaction as written. Take the weight of the reactant in your question and see what that is in moles by dividing by the it\u2019s molecular weight. Multiply the heat of reaction per mole of that reactant and you have your answer. If the stoiChiometric coefficient of the reactant for which you have the known weight is not 1, as in this case, divide the heat of reaction by that coefficient to get the needed per mole heat of reaction of that component. This is not rocket science. You needn\u2019t ask numerous questions of the same nature as you are expected to read and understand the responses and do similar problems on your own, not pollute Quora with such stuff, which is obviously just high school homework problems, if not a malicious attempt to weaken Quora\u2019s usefulness to people with bona fide questions.
