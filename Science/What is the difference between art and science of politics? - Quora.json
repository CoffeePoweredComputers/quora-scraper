            "answer_text": "The difference between the terms \u201cart\u201d and \u201cscience\u201d when referring to politics is the distinction between guiding one\u2019s action by intuition and \u201cfeel\u201d and basing decisions to act on relevant observation and well confirmed beliefs. It is not a difference based on the quantitative/qualitative distinction as your previous respondent suggests. Science can be either quantitative or qualitative based on the nature of the phenomena being observed or \u201cmeasured\u201d. Some concepts are inherently quantitative and need to be measured accurately to yield useful observations. Other concepts are categorical or ordered only by distinctions between more and less without a meaningful way to tell by how much more or less of the concept is observable. Art, on the other hand, depends upon the emotional impact of one\u2019s beliefs and how they \u201cfit\u201d in a given situation. The notion of distinguishing between the art and science of politics refers mainly (almost exclusively) to the conduct of political actions and not the study of those actions as conducted by political scientists. Political activists may act on the basis of their feelings or on the basis of prior knowledge. In the first case they are engaging in the art of politics, in the latter they are using the science of politics to guide their actions. ",

            "answer_text": "You know science right? What comes to your mind when I ask about science? Is it quantitative? Mathematical? Formula and modeling? Countable? And yes, you are right. It is applied usually in the US who tries to quantify political phenomenon. When politics comes to art, especially in Europe, they realize that political science has different pattern with natural science. It can be qualitative, it can be subjective, it doesn't have to be countable, you don't need to have a strong mathematical basic to understand social phenomenon. I myself prefer politics as an art. It should be free, not tied to numeric model. Since political science study about social phenomenon and society keeps changing I believe that political science should be flexible too. ",
