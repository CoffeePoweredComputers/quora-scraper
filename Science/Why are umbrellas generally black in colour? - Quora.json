            "answer_text": "Thanx for the a2a...actually there is no correlation between lightning and the colour of an object.It is just an urban legend that lightning is attracted towards black. The reason for choosing black for umbrellas I based on the principle of black body radiation. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation For those not in the know,in physics 'black body' refers to an ideal black surface that absorbs all electromagnetic radiations(uv rays,infra red rays...basically the whole deal).it radiates radiations in a typical spectrum called the black body spectrum dependant on its temperature. As an approximation it is permissible to speak of a black umbrella as a black body. Since the umbrella absorbs all the radiations from the sun,rather most(speaking within the approximation),it also absorbs part of the uv spectrum too.This in turn protects the user from the harsh uvA and uv B rays of the sun. Thus,black umbrellas are found in almost all households and shops of the tropic countries especially due to the threat of uv radiation being the most acute here,despite the wide and vibrant choice of  colors available.And this has been so since ages,considering the threat isn't new.

            "answer_text": "This has a very deep scientific approach. This is actually related to Heat Transfer Whenever light or heat falls on any object, the object absorbs some part of it and reflects the rest of it.Now, this is where the color of umbrella comes into picture. Whenever you go into summer, the sun emits ton of light, heat and radiation. A light colored umbrella will let most of it pass, and you will feel heat inside the umbrella. Whereas the black umbrella will first absorb and then throwback most of the radiation and heat, and you will feel better.  Hope this helps.
