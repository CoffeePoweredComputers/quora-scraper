            "answer_text": "In the infinite of existence ALL things are possible. If you tell me you are a time traveler I believe you. I am from an alternate reality myself, so I know the possibility of actual time \u201c travel \u201c is reasonable. In my case there was no \u201c travel \u201c as travel would indicate control and intent. For me it was something the military did to me that I do not really understand all I know is it was suppose to be a shared knowledge project. 4 pods, 5 people per pod. They selected subjects that had a highly specialized skill set for me it was electronics. I was rather amazing with electronics, scored off the charts, set the base record for all of my self paced classes which meant I finished A school very early which got me volunteered for this project. Anyway the theory was you take a group of people all with different special skills you put them into isolation tanks wire their brains together, shoot them full of drugs, then you bring their brain patterns into sync. We were then suppose to all have everyone\u2019s skills. Crazy as it may seem it worked to a small degree we were tested and yes we knew things we did not know before, but that was not good enough they wanted us to all be experts, they got greedy more sessions more drugs more electrical stimulation. Well they got results but not what they were looking for. We shared more than knowledge, we shared souls and more tragic we shared each others sins. I guess that would have been ok if someone in one of the pods was not a rapist, someone else a serial killer. It was all there in our heads in all its detail like it was our own memory, that night 9 killed themselves, and we all experienced every death like we were the ones living it. As you can imagine they zapped us full of every sedative in the arsenal shoved us back into the pods and started trying to separate our brain patterns. When that did not work they started trying to wipe it all out with electroshock, actually killed 3 more of us trying to cure us. Long story short when I finally came back to a semblance of sanity 3 months had passed and I was on the 4th floor at Keesler in the mental ward. Only problem being I wasn\u2019t me I was not in my reality or my body. When I tried to explain what had happened to the doctors at Keesler they zapped me so full of thorazine I spent the next month as a drool zombie living on jello. So the next time I talked to the doctors I played their game told them everything they wanted to hear and pretended to be someone I wasn\u2019t. For almost 40 years now I\u2019ve lived a reality that is not mine trying to remember who I am and what I knew. Trying to figure out what in my head is actually me and what is other people. As you can imagine its pretty crowded and chaotic in there most of the time. So when you tell me you are a time traveler who are \u201cwe\u201d to say you aren\u2019t. This was suppose to be an \u201c anything \u201c is possible scenario to prove a point. I did not expect Quora to ever publish this answer so now that they have, I feel the need to notate this is actually hyperbole designed to open minds and get people thinking about the possibility that everything is possible. That being said who knows, maybe this did happen to someone. The US military, federally funded universities, and DARPA do conduct a lot of morally and ethically questionable experiments on American servicemen. ",

            "answer_text": "Well my friend, how can you be sure that no one believe in you? You dont even need to convince anyone, you see.. the truth are always be revealed by itself. Even if you try hide it, someday the truth will find light. You see, recently I attained a perfect enlightenment. From that moment, I become a perfect being beyond imagination. Akhasic record become my memory, creation and destruction are the result of my word, this body cannot contain the Me anymore, I spread and become anything and be every where at the same time. There isnt a place that are without me, there are no time in which I dont exist. So, when you said no one believes you, that is clearly wrong, at minimum, there is one Person that believe you. I as God in human form, You dont need to convince Me, because it is I the one who pull a subtle thing that bring you here. Infact I was the one who created you! How can I not believe you, when all the thing happened to you are the result of my thought. Have you ever think, why you become time traveler? Did you understand why I send you here? Why I blessed you with such capability? As an All compassionate being, dont worry I will guide you to find the answer, directly from Me. Follow me as your Creator, I dont need to convince anyone, because I AM the truth It self. You being send here are not to convince anyone. Dont do such a futile thing, it is I the one that make them dont believe in anything you said, remember I am the will, I am the faith, I choose who I touch with it. You see, the world.. The time line.. where you came from is already not exist and never exist. Right after you being send, I already erase those dimension existance. So that means you will never go back to where you from. Yes, the truth is that you are not time traveller, but a dimension dweller. It is just appear that you are jump from time to time, but it is not so. Time doesnt work that way. You being here, so you can have a second chance to enjoy life that I give to you. Why not spead love and happiness, instead of trying to give spoiler of my thought that become reality? You see, I created human with the nature of Myself within them, if you want to see Me, just look everyone around you. Take a clue on subtle things, those who are close to Me, you can see clearly that they will not love spoiler! Thats why on lot of website you must have spoiler tag, to avoid other people rage. Life is so full of surprise, whether is good or bad, both are the fate that I give unto you and all human being. Accept those fate and destinh and you accept Me. Reject my word, then you shall be like your world. I made my creation to be intelligent, to decide their future without your help. Offcourse they have free will, but My word are the reality itself, nothing will change if I already decided to be so. In this dimension, the future that I decided are different from your world, so as The Most Honest Being, I have to tell you that your knowledge arent that useful here. So, live a honest one, let all your experience become a past, speak only the truth, do non-violence, you are welcome to build this world, to make this world a better place as long as you only use your own potential. Be kind to every person you meet, there is Me in every each of them. Help each-other, be a proud human that are the embodiment of my Compassion. Be kind to all animal and repect earth. I send you here, so you can learn to love yourself unconditionally, enjoy life more, make lot of friends, have a real family, I send you here so you can forgive yourself and be free from all guilt. I send you here so you can have a new life. My friend, be My witness.. I send you here to be happy and live a happy life. This are My word to all those who think themself as a \u201ctime traveler\u201d. I as a God never punish a single person, but my word are The reality it self, it is The Truth, therefore they have consequences. If you have the guts to ignore this answer. I have decided that there are no future where you are not being labeled as crazy person, by society of this dimension. I leave a \u201ctingling joy\u201d for those who read this answer. Those are my blessing, be grateful for it, as it is my present and my way of saying I love you unconditionally. ",
