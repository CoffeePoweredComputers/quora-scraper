            "answer_text": "Take a look at this charming creature:  If you ask someone what this is, you might get all sorts of answers: \u201cdaddy long-legs,\u201d \u201charvestman,\u201d \u201cbee reaper,\u201d and more. What\u2019s worse, some of those answers have also been used for other organisms. There are three(!!) other broad categories of organism that get called \u201cdaddy longlegs,\u201d and which one gets this name varies between regions. But scientific names are fixed and universal. Scientific names are like a bar-coding system for Earth\u2019s life, assigning a single identifier shared with nothing else to each individual variety of living thing. So what\u2019s that animal? It\u2019s probably Leiobunum rotundum, and scientists around the entire planet can recognize that name and know what animal bears it, with no confusion or hesitation and no chance of accidentally thinking it\u2019s the Pholcus phalangioides daddy longlegs or the Nephrotoma appendiculata daddy longlegs. This lack of ambiguity is critical for science, and beneficial for tasks ranging from pest control to exploratory medicine to determining the best ways to cook seafood. Scientific names are also the bottom few layers of the classification scheme that helps scientists understand the relationships between all life on Earth, but that\u2019s a bigger answer for a bigger question.

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s an animal, in the United States, that is variously known in different areas as a mountain lion, cougar, panther, painter, puma, etc. Note that it is not a \u201clion\u201d in the same sense that the African lion, or even the extinct American lion, is a lion. Calling it Puma concolor makes it clearer which animal you are referring to: that it is one species, not half a dozen of them, but also not the same species as, say, the (extinct) cave lion. Likewise, if you want to talk about a \u201crobin,\u201d you can make clear which of two not-closely-related passerine birds you\u2019re talking about by distinguishing between Turdus migratorius (American robin) and Erithacus rubecula (European robin). When Carolus Linneaus invented the modern classification system, he faced this problem: multiple regional names in different languages for each different plant and animal species, plus some use of the same names for more than one species, and tried to solve it by giving formal Latin names (a generic and specific name) to each species. It was part of his attempt to rigorously classify everything into distinct, named groups within larger groups. However complicated the system might seem, or how awkward the names, it\u2019s less complicated and awkward than having to list each species under a few dozen different names in different dialects and countries, and it helps clarify which species are closely similar to which (e.g. the American robin is more closely related to thrushes and blackbirds than to European robins).
