            "answer_text": "Socialc \u201cSciences\u201d generally, are not at all scientific - more literary/philosophical - what people say/undisciplined and ill defined, unbounded nonsense. Applied social sciences are, as you might therefore expect, a very mixed bag - if applied by someone with intelligence and sensitivity they can be very good - if by an unimaginative oaf - disastrous. There are intelligent and sensitive souls in this world - but also, alas, a plentiful supply of oafish scum. Whether the former can clean up the mess produced by the latter is moot. Stalin applied his view of scientific wisdom. Hitler did the same. As did Mao, Pol Pot, and not so few others. Of course (?) nobody now wants to repeat those mistakes. But it is arguable that the men named did not want to to produce the results that ensued - they thought they could do something better. ",
