            "answer_text": "Not every species has a conventional name. Not even close. Scientific names are a way to standardize the naming of species, so that when a scientist uses a scientific name every other scientist will understand exactly what species they are referring to and there is no potential for confusion because a species has exactly one scientific name. It\u2019s standardized. In the tarantula keeping hobby and scorpion keeping hobby it is standard practice to use scientific names. This is often confusing and annoying to newcomers; after all they\u2019d rather learn names like \u201cwhitestriped birdeater\u201d and \u201cMexican red-knee\u201d than Acanthoscuria geniculata and Brachypelma hamorii. The common names are so much easier and cooler sounding right? Wrong, at least in the long-run. You see, most tarantulas species do not have a standardized common name. If you are told a common name for a tarantula by the person who sold it to you, nine times out of ten they made the name up on the spot. Same thing applies when you see a common name for a tarantula on a sign at the zoo. And in a hobby where tarantulas vary wildly by temperament, environmental requirements, and venom toxicity, this can be dangerous. It is imperative that you know exactly what you are getting. If you bought a \u201crust-red bird-eater\u201d and thought you were buying Lasiodora parahybana but actually received Hysterocrates gigas, you\u2019re gonna have a really bad time. Also, if you don\u2019t know the scientific name good luck finding anything of value on the internet about caring for the species.
