He is to empathy and human suffering what a camel is to motorbikes and brassieres - complete indifference. No, good and example are antipathetic here. Good and Trump are antipathetic as well. He was briefed on Ratings - Ratings - Ratings before he went to the Vet. That\u2019s the ONLY reason he wore one. Call it like it is. Even Stalin had a love of animals and kept many on a farm. Trump likes some animals - chickens for examples. Deep fried with mashed potatoes. ",

Next stop should be Miami just to reinforce to the public that it is a good idea to wear a mask. Make a surprise trip to Houston after Miami. Don\u2019t forget those MAGA hats I am sure they are in short supply. I hear they are a good substitute for the barf bags they ran out of. When you get back to the WH take a good long look in the mirror. ",

As a result of being pathologically self-absorbed, he may not have initially considered the fact that by not wearing a mask he was putting a number of his devotees at risk by setting a bad example. He loathes backing down but has apparently come to the realization that he has already been responsible for an untold number of COVID-19 deaths as the result of supporters following his lead by refusing to wear a mask.
