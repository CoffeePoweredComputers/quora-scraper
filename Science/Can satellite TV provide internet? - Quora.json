            "answer_text": "Satellite TV refers to a uni-directional data flow from the broadcaster through the satellite to anyone who selects that broadcast. Each recipient gets the broadcast at the same time. Internet connections involve a two way exchange of data to allow the user to select what sites they are accessing and when they are accessing those sites. A TV capable of receiving satellite broadcasts may also be able to handle an Internet connection, but that connection will be coming from a different satellite. This differs from cable TV, where the cable can carry broadcast uni-directional TV and can also support two directional Internet connections. The cable TV signal will go directly to the TV set, while the Internet connection will go to a router, which may have a separate connection to the TV if the TV is to show Internet based services. ",
