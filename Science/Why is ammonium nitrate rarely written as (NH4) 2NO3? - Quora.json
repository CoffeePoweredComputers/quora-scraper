            "answer_text": "Because [math](NH_{4})_{2}NO_{3}[/math] is the INCORRECT formulation of [math]\\text{ammonium nitrate}[/math]. In this scenario we would have\u2026[[math](NH_{4})_{2}NO_{3}]^{+}[/math], a CATIONIC species\u2026 [math]\\text{Ammonium nitrate}[/math] is the SALT of ammonium cation, i.e. [math]NH_{4}^{+}[/math], and nitrate anion, [math]NO_{3}^{-}[/math]. And these thus combine in a 1:1 stoichiometry to give an electrically neutral salt\u2026 And so we got [math]NH_{4}^{+}NO_{3}^{-}[/math] as the correct formulation\u2026 Note that the Lewis structure of nitrate ion is interesting in that THREE of the four atoms have formal charges\u2026of course, resonance isomers exist\u2026 [math]O=\\stackrel{+}N(-O^{-})_{2}[/math]. Is this structure consistent with the formal charge of the ion? ",
