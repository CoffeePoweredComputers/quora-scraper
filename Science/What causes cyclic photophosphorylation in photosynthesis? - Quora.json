            "answer_text": "Cyclic photophosphorylation can be defined as the synthesis of ATP coupled to electron transport activated by Photosystem I solely, and can, therefore, proceed in long-wavelength light (03BB 2265 700 nm). This process is unaffected by the specific inhibitors of Photosystem II, such as CMU, DCMU, and ortho-phenanthroline. The current interpretation of cyclic phosphorylation is that the light-activated electrons of chlorophyll aI are used to reduce an acceptor, the nature of which is still uncertain, and then a sequence of electron carriers transport the electron down the electrochemical gradient, back to the oxidizing side of photosystem I. ATP formation is coupled to this electron transport. Experimentally, cyclic phosphorylation can, therefore, be distinguished from any other kind of chloroplast photophosphorylation by two criteria: 1) the resistance to CMU, DCMU, and ortho-phenanthroline; 2) the fact that light absorbed by photosystem I at the far-red end of chlorophyll an absorption spectrum is sufficient to activate the reaction.

            "answer_text": "In cyclic-photophosphorilation, chlorphyll absorbs sunlight which causes an electron to gain energy and jump to a stage referred to as the \u201cexcited-state\u201d in terms of chemistry. The electrons moves down to the electron acceptor from where it moves through carrier-1, breaking a molecule of ATP splitting it into ADP+P, when this happens, more energy is released therefore the electron slowly loses its energy, the electron moves through carrier-2 and carrier-3 breaking more ATP bonds and releasing more energy. Once the electron has lost all the excess energy it gained previously from the sunlight, it returns to the chlorophyll so the cycle can start all over again. The cause/ the role of cyclic photophosphorilation is to release energy. ",
