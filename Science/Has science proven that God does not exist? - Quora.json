(fyi, the question I originally answered was Does science refute God?) The fact is, every \"active\" God (that I've ever heard of), who plays some role in the present life of humankind, is completely implausible as an explanation for anything, from the perspective of scientific evaluation.   When people say that science doesn't refute God, they generally mean one of two things: 1. It is conceivable that there is some organizing principle of the Universe, as yet undiscovered, but within the realm of Continue Reading",

It is really ironic that in mathematics, chemistry or physics anyhow as soon as we derive a result, scientists get onto some result via evidences, experiments etc most people just believe it without counter-questioning but in case of God, even after having thousands of evidences and scientific proofs, many people are not ready to believe it. We all believe atom exists! but not god. When you ask \"wouldn't science have proven it by now?\" What do you mean by science here.. to be exact? Science isn't any single authorized standard. On a single topic t Continue Reading",

Science proves there is no such thing as supernatural powers nor can a person or entity manipulate or change reality due to the laws of physics and general relativity. Mankind invented the idea of god at the dawn of civilization to explain the unexplained, nowadays we would call that science or scientific theories. Example: The ancient Aztecs were one of the first truly advanced human civilizations and one of the first to truly accept the idea of god. They would Continue Reading",

That\u2019s how science works: somebody observes a phenomenon and tries to explain it (we call this a hypothesis). This explanation can then be supported by evidence or refuted. It used to be that virtually all phenomena were explained by the supernatural (why is there thunder? Thor must be angry!), nowadays there\u2019s fewer and fewer room for gods as an explanation. Science will not disprove the existence of gods (as a matter of fact it doesn\u2019t ever prove that something does not exist) but it will go on to disprove claims of  Continue Reading",

            "answer_text": "You're kind of misunderstanding how science works. It is a method (called the scientific method, oddly) to test a hypothesis, which is usually formed from observations. That is not a proof, so science doesn't prove anything one way or another. Mathematics uses proofs, but that's another subject. Science can only test hypotheses that are falsifiable. That is, can you test the positive hypothesis (let's say water freezes at 0\u00ba) and the falsifiable hypothesis (water does not freeze at 0\u00ba). So, any real hypothesis has to have it's falsifiable version also testable (though it doesn't necessarily hav Continue Reading",

However, science does indicate that the book doesn\u2019t mesh with reality, indicating it is a work of fiction, mythology. One thing young earth creationists get right is their Biblical dating. The Bible includes numerous ages of people at different times in their life, and you can build a timeline from it. Even allowing for the notion that people could possibly live hundreds of years, that timeline isn\u2019t long enough, and doesn\u2019t app Continue Reading",

For instance, the town spoken about in the Bible that references the fact that it was burnt to the ground. Archeologists have found a place that cannot be explained. The fire was so hot that it reached hundreds of degrees, and nothing we know of, to date, explains why it would elevate to that extent. Another anomaly that science has shown is the location of a ship that is similar to the one Noah built. It was found in a mountain. No  Continue Reading",

To explain: As you know, a hexagon is a plane figure with six straight sides and six angles, and an octagon, a plane figure with eight straight sides and eight angles. All right, then, let me ask you a question: Has science proved that a hexagonal octagon exists? No, it has not. And another question: Has science disproved that a hexagonal octagon exists? No, it has not. Why not? Because the expression \u201chexagonal octagon\u201d is nonsense. The proposition that there is a hexagonal octagon doe Continue Reading",

However, science also affirms absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. In other words, scientific method alone cannot prove God exists, but it cannot prove He does not either. What we can decide about the existence or non-existence of God is limited to what our physical brain can conceive. If we are to be truly scientific in this approach, and evolution is the resounding theory of the day, then human intellect developed from the physical brain of the primates Continue Reading",
