They can express a view on external scientific developments, and the rest of us are free to ignore them. We are also free to ignore those bodies that engage in pseudoscientific \u2018creation science\u2019. What is intolerable is when religious authorities pronounce on the correctness of scientists\u2019 conclusions on non-scientific grounds (\u201cOur book says your findings in biology or cosmology are wrong.\u201d) or the acceptability of their day-to-day work .(\u201cGood morning, brother - we\u2019re from the Ministry of Buggering People About Religiously, and we\u2019ve come to check whether your studies of polymer chemistry are compatible with Islam.\u201d) ",
