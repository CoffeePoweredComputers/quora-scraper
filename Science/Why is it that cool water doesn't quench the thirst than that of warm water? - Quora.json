            "answer_text": "Your question is slightly confusing for me. Your question implies that cool water does not quench thirst as well as warm water. But in actual fact, it is the other way round. Cool drinks really are the most satisfying when we are thirsty because they turn off thirst stimulators - neurons - in the brain. Here is a very interesting article on the subject: Scientists Use Light to Find Thirst Center in the Brain Neurons in the same area of the brain monitors blood composition also. The neurons trigger the feeling of thirst whenever the body\u2019s water levels are imbalanced to urge us to drink. Once we start drinking water, the signals from the neurons begin to subside and they turn off completely once enough liquid has been consumed. Drinking warm water does not have the same effect. ",
