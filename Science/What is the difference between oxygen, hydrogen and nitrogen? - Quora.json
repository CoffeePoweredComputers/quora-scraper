            "answer_text": "Oxygen (oxy= acid, gen= forming) is a highly electronegative chemical element that is used to rust metals like iron and alluminium with it\u2019s acidic forming properties, hence the name, oxy-gen. Oxygen is also vital to our bodies because of it\u2019s acidifying properties. The sugars and fatty acids in our body become too much some times and oxygen breaks some of them down. There is also iron in our blood which rusts with oxygen. Hydrogen (hydro= water, gen= forming) is the first and lightest chemical element that is used to burn as fuel, like when we light a kitchen stove, and part of the fire is blue. That blue fire is hydrogen, and since it\u2019s the coolest color, it\u2019s the hottest fire. You may know hydrogen from drinking water, because that water is made up of two hydrogens Nitrogen (nitro= cold, gen= forming) is a chemical element used as fuel. If you inhale nitrogen, it will eat away on your insides, killing you immediately. Liquid nitrogen, fourtounately cannot kill you in little amounts. In fact, in liquid form, nitrogen can be used to freeeze off infections. ",

            "answer_text": "Its very simple. The basic difference is all of them are different elements. Hows that?? Because they have different no. Of proton and neutrons inside the nucleus thats why they are name differently and have unique place in the mandeliff's periodic table. They stands on 1,7,8 for hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen respectively. This no. indicates no. Of proton present inside the nucleus. Hope i have cleared your doubt.",
