            "answer_text": "What is political science? (A2A from two Quorans - thanks for asking) There are already a lot of outstanding answers, so I am not sure that I can contribute much more to the discussion than has already been put forward, but I\u2019ll give it my best shot. The first is that the simple answer is almost always wrong and the complex answer is seldom right. The simple answer is that political science studies people and the ways in which they govern themselves and that answer is pretty much wrong because you have to already know the answer for the answer to make sense. The more complex answer is that political science is a group of subdisciplines that all fall under the same umbrella of trying to describe the small-r reality of a group of people (nations, states, localities, or whatever), how they make decisions as a group and how they enforce and implement the decisions they reach. There are four generally accepted areas of study, but \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d means that political scientists pretty much agree on these and there are some/many who do not. (1) Political Theory: this subdiscipline mostly grows out of philosophy and tries to create a set of rational and internally consistent \u201crules\u201d or \u201cprinciples\u201d to explain what can be observed in the real world. You might further subdivide this into normative (what should be) and positive (what is) approaches, but I promise (pinky swear) that this is a rabbit hole that should be approached with extreme caution because there is no answer that everyone will agree is \u201cright\u201d and few that even a majority will support. (2) Comparative Politics: this subdiscipline mostly looks at how different cultures and societies produce different institutions, normative assumptions, and outcomes. For example, while the United States and the United Kingdom come from identical cultural, religious, and historical backgrounds (1607 is a reasonable but not uncontested break-point), they produced radically different political systems. An American \u201cliberal\u201d would probably be quite comfortable in the UK\u2019s Conservative Party, for example (issues related to immigration, among others, would likely be an exception), but not in the Republican Party. Why and what are its effects? (3) Methodology: once you have framed the question, what constitutes an acceptable answer? What is acceptable evidence? How should that information be gathered? Which conclusions can be drawn from it and which conclusions are suspect/arguable? Lots of math, probabilities, and statistics in here, but also a lot of room for anecdotal or qualitative data in here. I like to think of it as the difference between what is possible (qualitative) and what is probable (quantitative), but that\u2019s a major oversimplification. (4) International Relations: this kind of combines #1 and #2, but it focuses specifically on interactions between nations (whatever those might be) rather than politics within a nation. At the time that I did my undergraduate work, there were only a handful of approaches to questions in this area (realism or realpolitik being the dominant approach), but now there are dozens. All of them provide a slightly different lens through which these questions can be viewed and that difference produces a lot of different is/isn\u2019t conclusions, leading to an even larger variety of approaches. The fifth category is going to be specific to the nation/country being examined. For the United States it\u2019s conveniently labeled \u201cAmericanist\u201d (very convenient), but it looks at questions involving the actors, institutions, and outcomes in a particular country and the answers are going to vary because of that. It would be extremely unreasonable to expect similar processes to produce similar outcomes in the American Congress (House and Senate) as those from the Russian Duma or the Japanese Diet, for example. It happens, but those folks are concerned with politics in individual countries. You can toss in areas like Public Policy, Law, Judiciary, state/local and the rest. I think most would probably agree that one or more of those are separate fields, but there is also a good argument that they are combinations of the big four/five. I\u2019m not sure that I have given a really good answer to what political science is (even Bill Clinton had problems with what \u201cis\u201d is), but it\u2019s hopefully a reasonable description of what it tries to understand.

Political science focuses on the theory and practice of government and politics at the local, state, national, and international levels.

Etymologically, the term political science or politics has been derived from the Greek word\u2019Polis\u2019, which means the City- State or the State. Hence Political Science deals with the problems of City or the State in which men live. It is, therefore, defined as the study of the activities of the state. Some scholars definition : Seeley: \u201cPolitical Science investigates the Phenomena of Government as Political Economy deals with wealth. Biology with life, Algebra with numbers and Geometry with space and magnitude\u201d. Paul Janet: \u201cPolitical Science is that part of science which treats of the foundations of the State, and principles of government.\u201d Laski: \u201cThe study of politics concerns itself with the life of man in relation to organized States.\u201d David Easton: \u201cPolitical Science is concerned with the authoritative allocation of values for a society.\u201d Bryce: \u201cPolitics is the conduct of public affairs for private advantage\u201d.

Political science focuses on the theory and practice of government and politics at the local, state, national, and international levels. We are dedicated to developing understandings of institutions, practices, and relations that constitute public life and modes of inquiry that promote citizenship. Some of the major subfields are described below. Political Theory Political theory is concerned mainly with the foundations of political community and institutions. It focuses on human nature and the moral purposes of political association. To clarify these concepts, political theorists draw on enduring political writings from ancient Greece to the present and on various writings by moral philosophers. Political theory also focuses on empirical research into the way political institutions function in practice. Here political theorists subject beliefs about political life found in important political writings to re-examination in the light of ongoing human behavior. In either case, political theory seeks to ultimately deepen political thinking and to spur citizens to responsible and creative political action. POL S 201, Introduction to Political Theory, provides students with an overview of the main lines of thought in political theory. Advanced courses focus on given concepts, topics, and thought in political theorizing. Comparative Politics Comparative politics is a broad field with a variety of approaches and goals. Some scholars and researchers compare contemporary political systems in order to judge which types best provide particular values: order, equality, freedom, or economic security and well-being for their citizens. Others suggest that the main purpose of comparative politics is to provide an understanding of how and why different societies develop different kinds of political institutions. Still others use comparative politics as a way of discovering general laws and theories that will explain human political behavior and its variability. Comparative politics courses are of two basic types. One offers comparisons of a particular set of problems or institutions in a number of different countries. The second type offers in-depth analyses of the basic political institutions and processes of a single country or group of countries in a world region. Most students will want to begin their study of comparative politics with the Introduction to Comparative Politics (POL S 204), which combines the two main approaches by including comparative discussions of particular problems, issues, processes, and institutions in a wide variety of political settings as well as in-depth readings and lectures on some of the major countries in the contemporary world. International Relations The field of international relations is concerned with developing an understanding of why states and non-state international actors, like the United Nations and multinational corporations, interact as they do. International relations is a diverse field both in terms of what kinds of behavior are studied and how they are studied. International conflict, particularly war, continues to be an important focus of the field. Why do wars start? Who wins and why? How can wars be prevented? What is the role of international law and organizations? As the world has become more interdependent, scholars have become more aware of the importance of international economic activity. As a result, scholars are analyzing world trade, communications, development, foreign investment, and international finance. How states make foreign policy decisions is another important area of study. National security policy, nuclear deterrence, arms control and defense spending decisions are typical examples of foreign policy decisions. POL S 203, International Relations, introduces the student to International politics. This is the foundation for a wide variety of offerings at the 300 and 400 levels, such as American foreign policy, global environmental politics, international political economy, and international conflict. American Government and Politics Students of American government and politics seek an understanding of politics as practiced in the United States. In addition to courses on the American presidency, the U.S. Congress, and the courts, the department offers specialized courses on such topics as the political role of mass media, the politics of race and ethnicity, constitutional law, policy formation, state politics, and American political thought. Some of the broad questions that concern students in this field are: How and why did American political institutions, ideas, and practices develop as they have? How does one go about evaluating them? Are American political institutions, ideas and practices unique, or are they similar to other societies? How might American politics be improved? POL S 202, Introduction to American Politics, is recommended preparation for most other courses in American Politics. To acquire first-hand experience with the American political system, students are encouraged to participate in academic internships in Washington D.C., Olympia, or Seattle. Political Methodology The subfield of political methodology is concerned using the philosophical bases of governmental technology, personal technology, empirical analysis design and analysis, and practical area study knowledge. Courses inside governmental methodology field cover philosophical problems with respect to the likelihood of a science of politics, the similarities and differences when considering political science as well as other personal sciences, alternative modes of description, and the truth of knowledge claims. Additionally they study the formulation of experimental and non-experimental research designs to make causal inferences about political processes and behavior and explore the. usage of data, math and computers for analysis of political data generated by these types of analysis designs. Pupils are supplied a way to perform specific and team studies through seminars. The governmental methodology faculty have actually current study and training interests such diverse subjects as media, feminist principle, language politics, political economy, rational option concept, and general public plan.

            "answer_text": "Political science, also called government, is a social science which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of political activities, political thoughts and political behaviour. It deals extensively with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of power and resources. Political scientists \"see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works.\" Political science comprises numerous subfields, including comparative politics, political economy, international relations, political theory, public administration, public policy and political methodology. Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, geography, psychology, and anthropology. Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of constitutions, political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective. International relations deals with the interaction between nation-states as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. Political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers. Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in social research. Approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, behaviouralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralism. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research and model building.

Aristotle was one of the first people to give a working definition of political science. Political science, as Aristotle developed it, therefore, is the science (episteme) or knowledge of human action within a field of ends reaching from the highest (the divine reality) to the lowest existent things in the order of being.",

            "answer_text": "Hello Aspirants, Political science is that branch of the social sciences that studies the state, politics, and government. Political Science deals extensively with the analysis of political systems, the theoretical and practical applications to politics, and the examination of political behavior. The Greek thinker, Aristotle, defined political science as the study of the state. Many political scientists view themselves as being engaged in fleshing out the connections between political events and conditions, and by this understanding they hope to construct a system of general principles that posit the way the world of politics works. Political science is not a standalone field and it intersects many other branches like sociology, economics, history, anthropology, public policy among others. Political scientists are much sought after these days because of the changing landscape of politics across the world and since the society wants to understand how the political world works, they need someone to explain the nuances of the political economy. Any casual perusal of the newspapers and the television channels reveals that political scientists are at the forefront of debates and discussions for their knowledge and expertise. Scope of Political Science The scope of political science is vast and experts have divided the field of political science into five sub-disciplines that are political theory, public administration, comparative politics, international relations, and public law. It needs to be noted that these sub-disciplines cover the entire gamut of the modern political economy and provide the basis for the study and understanding of how the global political economy works. The study of the matters concerning the allocation and distribution as well as the transfer of power is one of the main preoccupations of political scientists. The success or otherwise of the governance structures is gauged by political scientists who examine the multifaceted and multilayered factors at work that contribute to good or bad governance. The scope of the political scientists has now been broadened to include the realm of the study of the democratic elections across the world. In other words, with the explosion in the political systems all over the world, political scientists, and their scope of study has been considerably enhanced.

            "answer_text": "Q. What is political science? What does it study? (1) There\u2019s alot of uncertainty, if not confusion, on what constitutes Political philosophyPolitical sciencePoliticsThis answer explains the three. It starts with Political Philosophy because that\u2019s the starting point, from ideas through practice. (2) Political Philosophy (PP) It attempts to answer these questions. How does politics contribute to the well-being or otherwise of people?What is \u2018The Good Life\u2019? How is it achieved?What principles and values should be used to shape and judge political institutions?What sort of society will best allow its citizens to flourish?What do we really mean by equality, justice and freedom?Is it ever right to go to war? (Sam Qwato's answer to What are the principles of the Just War Theory?)Is it ever right to rebel against a government?What responsibility should government have for dealing with the global issues of terroism or the environment?PP is about good government. What does it involve? How is it to be regulated? How it is brought about? It\u2019s about the principles that help people decide whether any particular government is to be judged good or bad. It requires an examination of the fundamental principles of government. Why we need government?What its goals should be?How is it to be regulated?If it goes wrong, how to repair or replace it?PP may be seen as a branch of Ethics, or Moral Philosophy. Ethics looks at all issues of right and wrong in the way people treat one another, while PP limits itself to the specific issues related to our collective or political life. The ethics of social organization, applied across society. PP is Normative - this is what people should do.As opposed to \u2018descriptive\u2019 - this is what people actually do.(3) Political Science (PS) PS is \u2018descriptive\u2019, as opposed to \u2018normative\u2019. PS describes actual political societies or institutions.It\u2019s the study of politics.It\u2019s a study of the way in which nations and empires have have developed and spread globally, the study of Political geography.It\u2019s the study of how economics (finance, trade and the markets) shape society.(4) Politics Politics itself can be a practical, mechanical business. Sorting out how best to deliver agreed benefits, and so on. If it were only that, there would be few political issues to discuss. Every form of government would be judged simply on the basis of its delivery track record. But, life is not so straightforward. Our daily news feed is full of colorful, dramatic political animations that keep us hopeful, entertained, amused, flabbergasted, shocked, disgusted in equal measures. People disagree, ad nauseam, on the principles upon which society should be run. This perpetual tension brings us full circle back to PP! (5) PP, Politics and Economics Ultimately, PP is about ends. What we seek to achieve through Politics.Once the ends are agreed on, Politics and Economics are the delivery arms.But, political and economic systems tend to generate their own ends. So, these too are scrutinized within PP. (6) Piqued? Immerse here: Sam Qwato's answer to What are the classics of political philosophy? (7) On political ideologies: Sam Qwato's answer to What is political ideology?Sam Qwato's answer to What inspires political ideology?(8) Ideas, philosophies and politics in live action: An illustration: Sam Qwato's answer to Why are some Americans so opposed to universal healthcare?

Whether the study of politics should be called a \u201cscience\u201d depends on whether one thinks that the word \u201cscience\u201d should be reserved for the physical sciences (such as physics) or can be used in relation to the \u201chuman sciences\u201d as well. Certainly the same method can NOT be used in relation to politics as it is in the study of physics and the other physical sciences. Treating human beings as if they (we) are not beings (have no free will - no agency) and are just collections of chemicals which are, in turn, collections of atoms - is a very bad way way to study politics. So the term \u201cpolitical science\u201d is fine - as long as one does not try to use the \u201cscientific method\u201d of the physical sciences - and remembers that the word \u201cscience\u201d originally meant just a body of knowledge, or area of study. By the way the use of mathematics to try and \u201cplan\u201d society goes back at least to the economist Sir William Petty in the mid 17th century, and (in some ways) goes all the way back to Plato. It is a very bad way of trying to understand human affairs - human action and conduct. ",

People with political science degrees have a wide variety of jobs they can go into besides just governments positions. Businesses will hire people with these skills to help predict and respond to changes within the laws and consumers reactions.

These are: logical positivism (empirical method), Behaviouralism (individual and group behaviour),structuralism (allocation of functions), institutionalism (organisations with specific objectives), rational choice, public choice theory (balance of power between people and state, common interest), normative principles (expected outcomes) and natural reason (impartiality). It studies how government is constituted, how government functions (structure), what are its policies and what is their impact/success. Its success can be measured by testing where it stands on meeting certain objectives. These objectives are: security and stability, justice of all kinds, development- social and economic, also cultural (mainly education). ",

            "answer_text": "Dear student, Political science is that branch of the social sciences that studies the state, politics, and government. Political Science deals extensively with the analysis of political systems, the theoretical and practical applications to politics, and the examination of political behavior. The Greek thinker, Aristotle, defined political science as the study of the state. Many political scientists view themselves as being engaged in fleshing out the connections between political events and conditions, and by this understanding they hope to construct a system of general principles that posit the way the world of politics works. Political science is not a standalone field and it intersects many other branches like sociology, economics, history, anthropology, public policy among others. Political scientists are much sought after these days because of the changing landscape of politics across the world and since the society wants to understand how the political world works, they need someone to explain the nuances of the political economy. Any casual perusal of the newspapers and the television channels reveals that political scientists are at the forefront of debates and discussions for their knowledge and expertise. Scope of Political Science The scope of political science is vast and experts have divided the field of political science into five sub-disciplines that are political theory, public administration, comparative politics, international relations, and public law. It needs to be noted that these sub-disciplines cover the entire gamut of the modern political economy and provide the basis for the study and understanding of how the global political economy works. The study of the matters concerning the allocation and distribution as well as the transfer of power is one of the main preoccupations of political scientists. The success or otherwise of the governance structures is gauged by political scientists who examine the multifaceted and multilayered factors at work that contribute to good or bad governance. The scope of the political scientists has now been broadened to include the realm of the study of the democratic elections across the world. In other words, with the explosion in the political systems all over the world, political scientists, and their scope of study has been considerably enhanced.

Whether the study of politics should be called a \u201cscience\u201d depends on whether one thinks that the word \u201cscience\u201d should be reserved for the physical sciences (such as physics) or can be used in relation to the \u201chuman sciences\u201d as well. Certainly the same method can NOT be used in relation to politics as it is in the study of physics and the other physical sciences. Treating human beings as if they (we) are not beings (have no free will - no agency) and are just collections of chemicals which are, in turn, collections of atoms - is a very bad way way to study politics. So the term \u201cpolitical science\u201d is fine - as long as one does not try to use the \u201cscientific method\u201d of the physical sciences - and remembers that the word \u201cscience\u201d originally meant just a body of knowledge, or area of study. By the way the using math to try to \u201cplan\u201d society dates back at the very least into economist Sir William Petty in the mid seventeenth century, and (in certain methods) goes all the way back to Plato.

The success of the democratic set up of a country depends upon the politically conscious people. In order to form Public Opinion , the people should have a good knowledge in Political Science.

It\u2019s not like the physical sciences, but it\u2019s an attitude that includes empiricism and rigorous thought. Political Science can be a guide for action for people outside or no longer in academia. It\u2019s better than relying on one\u2019s assumptions gut feelings. It\u2019s a move against ignorance that if practiced by everyone in politics or punditry would save us from the vitriol and wordy spin common in today\u2019s political discourse. Political Science requires from us more than passive attention. If we accept it we need to do so with our discretion sensors turned on. We need to be on guard against a writer who lets his ideology distort the empirically obvious (as has happened occasionally in the physical sciences). We need to be on guard against ideas put together by \u201ccherry-picking\u201d (biased selectivity). We need to be on guard against mere assumptions of causality. We need to understand public opinion polls as rough approximations. And what else? Weak definitions and overly simplistic labeling? It would be childishly utopian to believe that among the good work done by people in Political Science absolutely none of it is erroneous, and it would be primitive to dismiss Political Science or any other subject taught by our great universities because it is imperfect. And because of its benefits it would be nonsense to label interest in it as elitist. ",

Political Science focuses on the theory and practice of government and politics at the local, state, national and international levels. The author went to recite definitions of Political Science by some scholars, namely: Seeley, Paul Janet, Laski, David Easton , Bryce, Hillman and Bottomore. Also worth reading is the answer by Sam Qwato on August 10, 2017. He spent useful time to define : (a) Political Philosophy (b) Political Science , and (c) Politics. Superb write up ; a must read. ",
