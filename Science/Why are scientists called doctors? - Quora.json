            "answer_text": "Ironically, this question is the wrong way around. The question should be asked, why is anyone who does not have a doctoral degree called doctor. A very high proportion of medical professionals do not have the right to be called doctor. For these \u201cdoctors\u201d it is a courtesy title. I hold the degree of Master of Science, technically I have the right to be addressed as Master or, even cooler, Magister. If I tried to insist on this I would, rightly, be considered a complete dickhead. TL;DR If you have a doctoral degree you are entitled to use the title doctor; if you do not, it is a courtesy title.

            "answer_text": "Scientists aren\u2019t called doctors unless they have a post-grad degree that entitles them to be called \u201cdoctor\u201d. This must be a doctoral degree and \u201cDoctorate\u201d is represented by the letter D. Examples include EdD, PhD, DNP, DBA, DPA and many more. And, yes, MD. Not all scientists have a doctorate. Some have a Master degree. Some have an undergrad degree and are working on a post-grad degree. MDs are regarded as scientists, in the larger sense of the word, although most aren\u2019t investigative in the way research scientists are. ",
