            "answer_text": "Air is a pure substance because\u2026 well\u2026 it's air. Air is described to be composed of up to 79% nitrogen, 18% oxygen and some other random stuff like carbon dioxide and noble gases for the other 3%. Air is not pure oxygen and neither is it pure nitrogen. The reason because air has been described to have a certain composition. A good example of this is water. Pure water must not have contaminants from outside including dissolved oxygen and other ionic/microscopic impurities in them. Not even living being such as bacterias or parasites or viruses. It must not be able to conduct electricity either. So it's apparently very difficult to obtain 100% pure water. Because air is already described as a mixture of gases, generally speaking, air can be described as a pure substance. ",

            "answer_text": "Air is absolutely NOT a \u201cpure substance\u201d. It IS a mixture of several gases, found all over the world in the same percentages in anature, found all over theworld in a very widely varying ratio of percentages during inductrial processes and in healthcare. Meteorlogy, the physical properties of \u201cair\u201d vary greatly in pressure, temperature, density, humidity, velocity (etc) depnding on loocation, night/night, altitude, environment. BUT! Because \u201c air\u201d is so common, and because \u201cair\u201d is used for everything we do based on its standard ratios of nitrogen-oxygen-Argon-water vapor, it is treated as a single substance in the scientific tables and lists. \u201cAir\u201d is NOT listed as individually separate gas mixtures, because it is not practical nor efficient for everybody to have to re-calculate density, molecular weight, emissisity or viscosity or heat transfer coefficients every time.
