            "answer_text": "Yes, I have seen it! How does it feel to have it around? Amazing. I feel touched. (Literally :P) What does it look like? Like this thing that always demands space..Gosh! Color? Transparent. It's voice? Peaceful mostly. At times a rush. It's qualities? Adjusts anywhere, anytime. It's shape? Well it's like a shape-shifter. :P It takes shape of anything it gets into! What does it need? A little space to exist. Wants to be free like a bird. When did I last see it? I was playing with a transparent polythene bag and then suddenly blew Air into it and there it was! I saw it. It was struggling to come out. When I forced it tighter, the bag suddenly developed a hole because of pressure and it escaped. It's greatest skill? It finds it's own ways to enter and escape. More like, \u2018 catch me if you can!\u2019 I think that\u2019s enough for now :D Bye! ",

            "answer_text": "Why so much trust on the eyes, we have so many other senses that perform different duties and all together makes a man perfect. One can see ice but can\u2019t keep on palm long enough because the feeling doesn\u2019t allow. Water is colourless and yet we can see and drink from a glass. The same glass when is emptied out now contains air and why not we still see the colour of air. Would this not be called judgemental error of the mind? The greatest scientific inventions start by visions which are not visible in generally but after the hypothesis are converted and proved and materialized in application a layman is able to see and feel. No doubt one day a layman would be able to see when the human would have evolved beyond the mundane mind and grown intelligent species. ",
