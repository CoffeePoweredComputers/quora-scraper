            "answer_text": "They are, according to the so-called Uns\u00f6ld theorem[1]. When one delves into quantum mechanics, a first obstacle to tackle is the dual nature[2] (wave-particle) of electrons because it affords the idea of atomic orbitals, i.e. regions of space that describe the behaviour of electrons themselves in an atom. The atomic orbitals for an atom are defined by a set of numbers, the quantum numbers[3]; such numbers determine energy values, \u201cshape\u201d, and number of equivalent ways that orbitals can be oriented in space (degeneracy). From these, the familiar \u201ccontour shapes\u201d of the atomic orbitals are  Like I said, these should be taken as limit contours of space around a nucleus where there is a high probability to find an electron with a specific set of quantum numbers. An interesting fact that answers the question: as a single s orbital is spherically symmetric, the sum of the electron densities of a set of three p orbitals, five d orbitals or seven f orbitals is spherical, too. This is what the aforementioned theorem states. In other words, although it may seem as though an atom with, say, a shell of s and p orbitals would have a \u201clumpy\u201d shape (due to its electrons), the total probability distribution[4] is spherical. From here, the idea of atoms as \u201cspherical\u201d with all the subsequent assumptions - such as, for instance, the \u201chard sphere\u201d model[5] that describes collisions, interactions and energy exchanges.

            "answer_text": "Because when we solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we find we quantise the wave function where the quantum numbers are defined as n = (nr + 1/2) + ( + 1/2) where nr and \u2113 define the number of radial and angular nodes in the wave functions respectively, and the halves define radial and angular uncertainty. Therefor, unlike the orbitals you see in the average text book, those orbitals are busy rotating. SAs an example, the 1s orbital is NOT, as many seem to say, motion on a line through the nucleus. If it were it would violate the Uncertainty Principle because you would have a defined angular position, and a defined angular velocity (zero). Instead, the angular uncertainty gives you a spherical distribution. In my opinion, there are consequences for this for the chemical bond, some of which I outline in my ebook Guidance Waves. ",
