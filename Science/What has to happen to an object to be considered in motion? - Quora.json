            "answer_text": "Motion is a relative term. Objects move in a reference frame\u2014in other words, you (the observer) choose what point in space you consider to be the \u201cstatic\u201d base and then, if the object\u2019s distance changes in time relative to that point, you say that the object moves. So, as you can see, absolutely nothing has to happen to that object. If you look at Earth while standing on it (considering yourself the \u201cstatic\u201d point of reference), the Earth doesn\u2019t move (relative to you). But when you look at it from the Moon, you can see it moving. If you wanted to know what has to happen in order to make a previously static object move (in the same reference frame), then the answer is that a force must be applied. As the speed of it was 0 and now it\u2019s not, the speed had to change. Change of speed in time is called acceleration. Acceleration is caused by application of force (in Newton\u2019s classical mechanics). But you don\u2019t need force to keep an object moving (unless it is decelerated, for example by friction). That\u2019s what the 1st Newton\u2019s law says. See Newton's laws of motion - Wikipedia. ",
