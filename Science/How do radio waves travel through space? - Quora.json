            "answer_text": "Radio waves are just another form of light, and just like how you explore the world with your eyes in visible light you can explore space with radio light, and this comes with some big upshots mainly to do with the telescopes. optical telescopes are super expensive even small ones can be in the thousands, where as a radio telescope is cheap and could be as simple as a bent ish piece of metal and a radio, this also means that they can be made far larger than you be possible with a visible light telescope which allows for a greater light collecting area and so greater sensitivity allowing you to detect fainter signals, as an example of how sensitive we are talking a moderns radio telescope could detect the tiny signal produced by your phone speaker when it rings, on the moon radio telescopes are unhindered by gas and dust that is present in space which means that you can see further through the fog of stars in the galactic plane allowing you to \u2018see\u2019 all the way to the other side of the galaxy something that is simply not possible with visible light telescopes, as a note with is also possible with far infrared telescopes like the spitzer space telescope.

            "answer_text": "Radio waves are light, just with a much larger wavelengths than are visible to us humans. We only use a very tiny span of 780\u2013350 nanometers-long light, but there are smaller wavelengths, and (in the case of radio waves) kilometers long wavelengths that are just as real, but not perceptible to our senses. Snakes and bees can see infrared and and UV light, respectively. Microwave and radio waves are just longer (sometimes just stretched) versions of red, and infrared light. I can imagine a huge creature with eyes as big as skyscrapers that can see radio light. They travel through space the same way as visible and UV light travels to the Earth from the sun. Electromagnetic radiation/photons do not need a medium to travel through space like sound does through air. They can travel through vacuum, as well. As a part of the same fundamental force, the Earth's magnetic field exists around the Earth, in the vacuum of space beyond the atmosphere. It doesn't strike most of us as odd that the magnetic force is not impeded by vacuum; photons are part of that same force. ",

I\u2019m only partially joking. Here\u2019s a gif that visualizes the above description:  The part I\u2019m over simplifying is how the electrons motion actually causes the ensuing field, and why the magnetic and electric fields are tied together. Check out Maxwell\u2019s equation\u2019s for more on that. Also, the electric field and magnetic field are able to exist in a vacuum because free space has permittivity and permeability. ",

            "answer_text": "Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic waves, similar to microwaves, IR, light and UV, X-rays and gamma rays, which as Tom has aptly described are self-regenerating electric and magnetic fields, they do not need a carrier or a medium for their propagation (unlike medium-dependent waves, such as pressure or sound waves), hence they travel freely through vacuum and free space with the speed of light. This is simple as that. ",
