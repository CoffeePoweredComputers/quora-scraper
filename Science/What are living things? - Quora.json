            "answer_text": "It is a good question. It seems to be a easy question but i think it is the hardest and many even don't know it. To prove anything that is something,we should define a quality that proves it as something. So it's same to living things too,there are many qualities and defining features for living. The things things which are said to be living should show them and they are: 1.Growth from internal (that is some mountains also grow but is by deposition of materials on it where as in living things,cells increase and results in total growth of body) 2.Reproduction(it is a very important event in living things to perpetuate (to continue) life. 3.Interactions( the ability of constituents to interact and form new things that is atoms together form molecules, molecules together form cell organelles,cell organelles together form cells,cells together form tissues, tissues together form tissue systems in plant's and organs in animals, further organs form organ systems and completes total body) 4.Metabolism(all chemical reactions occurring in body) 5.Consciousness(ability to know what happening in surroundings and how to act). And self-consciousness is only present in human that is capability to understand whats happening in his own body. Etc. These qualities defines living things. Things which shows these fundamental characters are living things. I hope it helped \u263a\ufe0f. Thanks for scrolling \ud83d\udc4d ",
