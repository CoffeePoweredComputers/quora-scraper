            "answer_text": "Cellulose digestion is fiber digestion. Cellulose, is insoluble fiber in the human diet. Every plant has cell walls made from cellulose, which consists of thousands of structurally alternating glucose units which gives cellulose its strength but prevents it from interacting with human enzymes. Science Clarified. Cellulose contains just as much energy as starch because both molecules consist of glucose subunits. If that energy were physiologically available, humans could lower their food consumption and produce much less digestive waste than they currently do. Department of Chemistry - Elmhurst College/ Studies show that the human digestive system is much closer to that of herbivores rather than carnivores. Humans have the short and blunted teeth of herbivores and relatively long intestines-about ten times the length of their bodies. The human colon also demonstrates the pouched structure peculiar to herbivores. Yet, the human mouth, stomach, and liver can secrete enzymes to digest almost every type of sugar except cellulose, which is essential to a herbivore\u2019s survival. DUJS Online. ",
