            "answer_text": "\u201cPluton\u201d is a generic term for any kind of intrusion. Tabular Intrusions are generally thin and planar. Sills are parallel to the adjoining layers.Dikes cut across layers. Also used for cases where there is no enclosing structure.Laccoliths are blister-like masses where a dike or sill has pushed the overlying layers upward.Lopoliths are mega-sills, kilometers thick. They were originally thought to be so massive they bowed the crust down. Nobody is terribly sure of that now.Non-Tabular Intrusions: Stocks are irregular intrusions a few kilometers in diameter. In three dimensions they are thick lima-bean shaped bodies.Batholiths are huge intrusions and generally consist of many overlapping stocks.Diapirs are masses that push the surrounding rocks aside. They often ghave teardrop-shaped map outlines.Diatremes are small cylindrical masses emplaced explosively. Diamond pipes are diatremes.",
