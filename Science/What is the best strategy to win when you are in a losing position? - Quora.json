            "answer_text": "This is not a good question to be asking. The time to think about how to handle losing situations is before you start, not when they happen. Many people undertake risks thinking only of a winning strategy. They would be wise to have an exit strategy as well. If things go as planned, and you win, great. If they don\u2019t, you should have your actions planned as well. One common mistake is to hold on to the goal of winning too long. Poker players learn early to fold when it no longer pays to compete\u2014or they go broke fast. If you start a war hoping for a quick, cheap victory; and it bogs down; a quick withdrawal or negotiated peace is usually far superior to fighting on until you\u2019ve lost everything and must surrender unconditionally. Of course, there are situations in which you cannot afford the luxury of an exit strategy, or a fold. If you are invaded by genocidal fanatics, you have to keep trying to win until you die. If there\u2019s something you can\u2019t live without, then you have to keep competing for it, whatever the odds. But in this case it\u2019s even more important to think things through beforehand. If you know you cannot retreat, you can turn this to your advantage. Cortez is famous for burning the boats of his invasion force in Mexico, so his soldiers knew they had to win or die, there was no fleeing back to Cuba. Keeping open retreat options that you will refuse to use is bad strategy. ",
