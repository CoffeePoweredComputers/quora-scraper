            "answer_text": "Electrons ( or negative charge) flow from negative potential to positive potential ,or we can also say that positive charge flow from positive to negative potential. Electric current or Conventional current is assumed to be flow to positive charge, Hence ,the direction of Electric current ( Conventional current) is opposite to the direction of electron. But why use two conventions for the same thing. Actually the story began\u2026  In 1752 , Benjamin Franklin did a kite experiment in which he and his son flew a kite with a pointed, conductive wire attached to its apex ,It was flown near thunder clouds to collect electricity from the air. Electricity from the storm clouds transferred to the kite and electricity flowed down the string and gave him a little shock ,He called it charge or electric fluid ( basically a positive charge). Being a pioneer in that field, his theory was adopted that flow of postive charge is called Electricity ( i.e. conventional current ) . But was Benjamin Franklin really the first person to discover electricity? Maybe not, but the idea got famous from here. In 1897 ,Electron was discovered, however by 1897 , Franklin's convention had been in use for nearly 150 years, so appeared in thousands of books, tens of thousands of electrical circuit diagrams, and millions of minds by then.Although Franklin's convention is not true in the context of conducting metals, it continues to be used in textbooks and circuits . Finally , I would like to clarify that current flows in the conductor is due to flow of electrons , but since the conventional current direction which is assumed to be the flow of positive charge does not harm our main notion, this continues to be used. Direction of conventional current can be seen as opposite charge particles, move in the opposite direction ( Double negation make our original fact to be true) Sources: Kite experiment - Conventional Current Vs Electron Flow: swimming against the tide?.

            "answer_text": "First of all, everyone who says that current is the flow of electrons should go back to school. It\u2019s not; it\u2019s just NOT. Reach up and slap yourselves, right now. I\u2019ll wait\u2026. Oh, and I don\u2019t care if your teacher(s) told you it was the flow of electrons. It is not, and they should go back to school too. Okay. Pay attention: Current is the flow of charges. Charged particles if you like. Are electrons the only charged particles? No. Okay, you in the back sit down and stop calling out. Electrons are not the only particles that can move. That\u2019s wrong. Yes, I know protons don\u2019t move around, they\u2019re locked in the nucleus. But the entire nucleus can move; the entire atom can move, or rather the whole ion, because remember, the particles have to be charged. And that\u2019s exactly what happens in a glass of salt water if you put a current through it. Positively charged sodium cations move toward the cathode (negative terminal) while negatively charged chloride anions move toward the anode (positive terminal). That\u2019s where we get the names cation and anion The unit of electric charge is the coulomb (symbol=C). And charge can be positive or negative. So a coulomb (or any amount of charge) can be positive or negative. The unit of electric current is the ampere (symbol=A). An ampere is a current flow of one coulomb per second ( 1 A = 1 C/s). Obviously, if the number of coulombs is positive, the current in amperes is positive, and if the number of coulombs is negative, the current in amperes is negative. In particular, a 1 A current flow is a flow of +1 C/s, and a -1 A current flow is a flow of -1 C/s. But a current of 1 A can be a flow (each second) of a coulomb of positive charge flowing one way, a coulomb of negative charge flowing the other way, or a half coulomb of each, flowing in two different directions (which is what\u2019s going on in the salt water.) So why do soooo many people get this wrong, and say that electric current is the flow of electrons? Because it\u2019s true in metals. In metals (and also in vacuum tubes, for those of us older than dirt). Most people\u2019s experience with electricity is confined to currents in wires. And wires are made of what? Metal. Can it be that simple? I\u2019m afraid so. When people picture an electric current, they picture a current in a wire. Wires are metal, and metals are held together with (surprise!) metallic bonds, in which the nuclei of the metal atoms are surrounded by a \u201csoup\u201d of easily mobile valence electrons. That\u2019s why metals are shiny, and that\u2019s why they conduct electricity. Freely mobile electrons. So, in wires, the charged particles that are moving are electrons, and electrons have a negative charge. A coulomb of electrons has a value of -1 C. And -1 C moving one way is exactly the same as +1 C moving the other way. But don\u2019t most currents flow in wires? Isn\u2019t that the right way to think about it? No. Most current does not flow in wires. A lot does, mainly on Earth. But in lightning, which dwarfs the output of power plants, the current flows through a plasma. Ionized air. What are the charge carriers? Free electrons in one direction and positive nuclei in the other direction, simultaneously although, in terms of charge, not equally, due to the mass disparity between electrons and ions. So in metal wires, it\u2019s electrons, but in the remaining approximately 100% of the observable universe, nearly all the current flows through plasma. But I digress. The basic question is: Did Franklin get it \u201cwrong\u201d? Not really; he made an arbitrary choice about something that is completely arbitrary. He could have called the charges east and west, or hither and yon, or yin and yang, and it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. To use them in a math formula we\u2019d still have to arbitrarily assign positive to one charge and negative to the other, just as we arbitrarily assign positive to upward motion and negative to downward motion. (And not all textbooks agree on that!) This is no more difficult to understand than the idea that a ball moving eastward with a negative velocity is actually moving westward. If you want the math to work, you have no choice. Electric charges are identified as + and -. Get over it. <mic drop>  ",
