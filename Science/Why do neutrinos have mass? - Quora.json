            "answer_text": "Why do neutrinos have mass? All known neutrinos must have some (infinitesimal) mass. According to special relativity, if their rest masses were zero, they must travel at the speed of light, and when measured from our reference frame, would not have time to oscillate into different generations. However, there could be dark light neutrino-like particles that have zero negative-imaginary rest masses. For more on the known neutrino\u2019s masses, please see the questions, answers, and links that follow: Why is the mass of the neutrino so close to zero? Physicists have not yet predicted particle masses; except when they are symmetric to a particle of known mass. Neutrinos are negative relativistic mass symmetric particles to their corresponding ordinary electron, muon, and tau particles. Their masses are predicted by dividing the masses of the electron, muon, and tau particles by the neutrino\u2019s Lorentz factors, which are always greater than >10^+6. Because neutrinos all travel at (infinitesimally) faster than the speed of light, their Lorentz factors are always negative-imaginary numbers. When you divide the masses of the electron, muon, and tau particles by the neutrino\u2019s negative-imaginary Lorentz factors, you get very small, \u201cclose to zero,\u201d negative-imaginary rest masses, for the three generations of neutrino particles, i.e. the electron neutrino, muon neutrino, and tau neutrino particles. Neutrinos are always almost all energy and almost, but not quite, zero rest masses, unlike any ordinary particles. All that energy has negative gravity and is the source of dark energy. For much more on dark energy, neutrinos, and \u201crelativistic mass symmetry,\u201d please see the below link, questions, and answers that follow: What is dark energy? Why does it matter? What is dark energy? Dark energy is comprised of neutrinos and neutrino-like particles that travel at speeds (infinitesimally) greater than the speed of light. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05155...: On July 13, 2018, it was announced that the IceCube-170922A neutrino arrived about 10 days before electromagnetic signatures were received by telescopes from blazar TXS 0506+056, about 4 x 10^9 light-years distant. This is definitive proof that this neutrino traveled at infinitesimally greater than the speed of light. These particles have so much energy-momentum because their Lorentz factors are always observed to be greater than 10^6. They cannot slow down to less than the speed of light, like ordinary positive-real matter must be able to do. For more on this, please see my answers below to the following questions: Is there anything faster than a ray of light? Yes! Neutrinos travel at (infinitesimally) greater than the speed of light. Dark energy consists of neutrinos and predicted neutrino-like quantum mechanical particles, with negative properties including gravity, that constitute a dark \u201cquantum universe\u201d symmetric, via \u201crelativistic mass symmetry,\u201d to the one we are familiar with. For more on this, please see my answers below to the following questions: What are the most prevalent current hypotheses concerning dark matter and dark energy? Unfortunately, there are no prevalent good hypothesis or theories concerning dark matter or dark energy. Physicists are at a roadblock, looking for dark matter WIMPS that don\u2019t exist; and stuck on the rejected by Einstein \u201ccosmological constant\u201d that would blow up our universe in a \u201cbig rip.\u201d But there is an excellent well-researched theory, encompassing both dark matter and dark energy, a draft of which was published on May 13, 2018: Dark Energy - Dark Matter, A Treatise on their Unified Cause and Effects A brief summary follows: Dark energy is the name given to that which causes the accelerated expansion of our universe. According to Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle of general relativity, acceleration is indistinguishable from gravity. So dark energy is also indistinguishable from gravity. Gravity is associated with mass, and negative gravity would be associated with negative mass. A result of Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity is that negative mass must travel at (infinitesimally) greater than the speed of light, and would have negative-imaginary rest mass. The only particles to be measured to travel at greater than the speed of light are the neutrinos. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05155...: On July 13, 2018, it was announced that the IceCube-170922A neutrino arrived about 10 days before electromagnetic signatures were received by telescopes from blazar TXS 0506+056, about 4 x 10^9 light-years distant. If they were initiated by the same rare event, as assumed, this is definitive proof that the neutrino traveled at infinitesimally greater than the speed of light. This is confirmation my prediction, in my thesis above. Also, neutrinos have the negative mass squared, that can only come from (negative)-imaginary rest mass: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2017/listings... \u2013 Page 6: MASS SQUARED (electron based) = \u2212 0.6 \u00b1 1.9 eV^2 OUR AVERAGE \u2013 12 negative, all larger or equal to \u2212 0.6, 2 positive but with the highest probable errors. And there are many more symmetric particles that are predicted by \u201crelativistic mass symmetry\u201d that have negative mass and gravity as well. The estimated 25% dark matter effect could simply be a \u201chole\u201d or \u201cdeficiency\u201d in dark energy, not a separate particle. In this case, dark energy would only have to overcome the 5% positive matter, not the 5% + 25% = 30% overestimated positive matter. Only a fraction of the estimated 70% dark energy would be needed. Neutrinos, and predicted symmetric neutrino-like negative gravity particles, explain it all. Physics is beautiful and, once you get it right, everything fits together in perfect harmony. If relativistic mass is an outdated concept then what is the status of the concept of rest mass? The status of the concept of Lorentz invariant \u201crest mass\u201d (m) is rock solid and here to stay. In 1989 an article in \u201cPhysics Today\u201d started a movement to abolish the teaching of \u201crelativistic mass\u201d (m\u03b3). This is still controversial. The concept of, \u201crelativistic mass\u201d is not yet outdated; it is temporarily out of fashion. The two can coexist as long as (m) is reserved for rest mass and the Lorentz factor (\u03b3) is kept explicit in the equations. My discovery of \u201cRelativistic mass symmetry\u201d is revolutionary and will refocus the attention of theoretical physicists on relativistic mass and what mass fundamentally is. \u201cRelativistic mass\u201d has a deeper significance than ever imagined. The suppression of relativistic mass has contributed to the current impasse in physics where neutrinos\u2019 mass, dark energy and dark matter have not been explained. Without the concept of \u201crelativistic mass\u201d it is virtually impossible to explain my discoveries of relativistic mass symmetry; the mass, properties, and behavior of neutrinos; the reversed gravitational acceleration of our universe; dark energy or dark matter. My explanations of these things follow. The postulates of Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity are: (1) The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference. (2) The speed of light in a vacuum has the same value c in all inertial frames of reference. These postulates lead to the Lorentz transformation and the Lorentz factor, \u03b3 \u2261 1/\u221a[1 \u2013 (v/c)^2]. The Lorentz transformation, in turn, leads to all of the special relativity predictions. They predict: (1) Positive-real rest mass particles (ordinary matter) must travel at less than the speed of light in a vacuum. (2) Zero rest mass particles (light photons) must travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. (3) Particles that travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum (neutrinos) must have mathematically negative-imaginary rest mass. These latter particles, like light, can't rest. Because their Lorentz factor is also negative-imaginary, \u03b3' = \u2013i x >10^6, their product relativistic mass (m'\u03b3'), is negative-real, as is their gravity. Due to their extreme velocity, negative-real relativistic mass neutrino particles are almost all energy. There is symmetry between ordinary particles that travel at less than the speed of light and neutrinos that travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum. I call it, \u201crelativistic mass symmetry.\u201dRelativistic mass symmetry is symmetry between positive matter and negative (yes, negative) matter. It is highly improbable that it could exist between positive masses. Ordinary matter, which we see, has positive-real relativistic masses (m\u03b3), rest masses (m), Lorentz factors (\u03b3), energies [E = c^2m\u03b3], but negative Newtonian predicted gravitational accelerations [a = \u2013m\u03b3(vector r/r)/(r^2)] because m\u03b3 is positive-real. Relativistic mass symmetry neutrinos are the hypothesized dark energy, cannot be seen, have negative relativistic masses (m'\u03b3' = \u2013 m\u03b3), negative-imaginary rest masses (m' = \u2013 m\u03b3/\u03b3'), Lorentz factors (\u03b3' = \u2013i x >10^6), and positive Newtonian predicted gravitational accelerations [a' = \u2013m'\u03b3'(vector r/r)/(r^2)] because m'\u03b3' is negative-real and the double negatives become positive. I discovered, \u201crelativistic mass symmetry\u201d when investigating negative relativistic mass (m'\u03b3') as a candidate for dark energy and found that neutrinos had its predicted properties. Relativistic mass symmetry not only predicts neutrinos and their properties, but also new additional neutrino-like particles. Here is the precise predicting equation for the neutrinos\u2019 and predicted neutrino-like particles\u2019 rest masses, in terms of their ordinary corresponding namesake particles\u2019 rest masses: m' = \u2013 m\u03b3/\u03b3', where m' is the negative-imaginary rest mass of the neutrinos; m is the rest mass of the neutrinos\u2019 corresponding namesake ordinary particle; \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor of the neutrinos\u2019 corresponding namesake ordinary particle, which is normally essentially equal to one \u03b3 \u2248 1.0; and \u03b3' is the neutrinos\u2019 negative-imaginary Lorentz factor, which is always \u03b3' = \u2013i x >10^6. The resulting precisely predicted neutrinos\u2019 rest masses are: Electron neutrino\u2019s rest mass = \u2013i x <0.511 eV/c^2,Muon neutrino\u2019s rest mass = \u2013i x <105.7 eV/c^2,Tau neutrino\u2019s rest mass = \u2013i x <1,777 eV/c^2. Antineutrinos\u2019 predicted rest masses are the same. These predicted values are all somewhat less than their published upper limit values, calculated from their measured negative (yes, negative) mass squared (m'^2) values. The square root of a negative number is \u00b1 an imaginary (yes, imaginary) number. Currently observed electron neutrino\u2019s masses are less than 1 eV and their energies are at least 1 MeV, so their Lorentz factors (\u03b3\u2019) calculated from the ratio <1 eV/>1 MeV = > 10^6 are: \u03b3' \u2261 1/\u221a[1 \u2013 (v'/c)^2] = \u2013i x >10^6. The speeds |v'| of currently observed neutrinos can be precisely calculated from these Lorentz factors. They are in the range of: c < |v'| < (1 + 0.5 x 10^\u201312) c. The latest CNGS2 (ICARUS) measured average speed differential was: (|v'| \u2013 c) = (0.04 \u00b1 0.28stat. \u00b1 0.98syst.) x 10\u20136 c, which is faster (yes, faster) than the speed of light in a vacuum. Special relativity\u2019s first postulate, the principle of relativity, indicates that multiple properties of neutrinos require travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum. (1) Because neutrinos never stand still in any of our reference frames that travel at less than the speed of light, and they have mass so that they cannot travel at the speed of light, they must travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum, where they can stand still in their reference frame. (2) If neutrinos traveled at less than the speed of light in a vacuum there would be reference frames in which they changed helicity handedness. But neutrinos all have left-handed helicity, they never change helicity handedness. (3) For the principle of relativity and \u201crelativistic mass symmetry\u201d to work between both electrons and their namesake electron neutrinos, one of them must travel at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum. The laws of physics work in their reference frames and in our reference frames. In their reference frames, we are the ones always traveling at greater than the speed of light in a vacuum. Dark energy is composed of these relativistic mass symmetry particles. On the other hand, dark matter, I have proposed, is a deficiency of these dark energy neutrinos. Having no dark matter particles reduces the required dark energy by a factor of 6.5. Our new frugal universe now contains three different types of rest mass: negative-imaginary, zero and positive; proportioned as follows: 67.7% dark energy, 31.8% light photons and ordinary matter. My revolutionary predictions are all solidly based on Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity and observational data. Since many neutrinos are already in the standard model of quantum mechanics, dark energy and dark matter are no longer unknown dark particles. Physics, astronomy, and cosmology are now solidly based on known and predicted quantum mechanical particles. ",

            "answer_text": "In short , the Standard Model of particles physics said that neutrinos are without mass , but then certain experiments provided evidence that neutrinos oscillate and do have mass . According to Wikipedia : The Standard Model of particle physics assumed that neutrinos are massless. However the experimentally established phenomenon of neutrino oscillation, which mixes neutrino flavour states with neutrino mass states (analogously to CKM mixing), requires neutrinos to have nonzero masses. Massive neutrinos were originally conceived by Bruno Pontecorvo in the 1950s. Enhancing the basic framework to accommodate their mass is straightforward by adding a right-handed Lagrangian. This can be done in two ways. If, like other fundamental Standard Model particles, mass is generated by the Dirac mechanism, then the framework would require an SU(2) singlet. This particle would have no other Standard Model interactions (apart from the Yukawa interactions with the neutral component of the Higgs doublet), so is called a sterile neutrino. Or, mass can be generated by the Majorana mechanism, which would require the neutrino and antineutrino to be the same particle. In 1998, research results at the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector determined that neutrinos can oscillate from one flavor to another, which requires that they must have a nonzero mass. While this shows that neutrinos have mass, the absolute neutrino mass scale is still not known. This is because neutrino oscillations are sensitive only to the difference in the squares of the masses. The best estimate of the difference in the squares of the masses of mass eigenstates 1 and 2 was published by KamLAND in 2005: [math]\\text {$\\Delta $m} _ {21}^2[/math] = 0.000079 eV^2. In 2006, the MINOS experiment measured oscillations from an intense muon neutrino beam, determining the difference in the squares of the masses between neutrino mass eigenstates 2 and 3. The initial results indicate |[math]\\text {$\\Delta $m} _ {32}^2[/math]| = 0.0027 eV^2, consistent with previous results from Super-Kamiokande. Since |[math]\\text {$\\Delta $m} _ {32}^2[/math]| is the difference of two squared masses, at least one of them has to have a value which is at least the square root of this value. Thus, there exists at least one neutrino mass eigenstate with a mass of at least 0.04 eV. In 2009, lensing data of a galaxy cluster were analyzed to predict a neutrino mass of about 1.5 eV. This surprisingly high value requires that the three neutrino masses be nearly equal, with neutrino oscillations on the order of meV. The masses lie below the Mainz-Troitsk upper bound of 2.2 eV for the electron antineutrino. The latter will be tested in 2015 in the KATRIN experiment, that searches for a mass between 0.2 eV and 2 eV.A number of efforts are under way to directly determine the absolute neutrino mass scale in laboratory experiments. The methods applied involve nuclear beta decay (KATRINand MARE).On 31 May 2010, OPERA researchers observed the first tau neutrino candidate event in a muon neutrino beam, the first time this transformation in neutrinos had been observed, providing further evidence that they have mass.
