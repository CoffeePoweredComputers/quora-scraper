            "answer_text": "The very nature of the Catholic church and of progression through its ranks rather limits the likelihood of any significant difference being noticeable between one pope and the next. The hierarchy of the church is such that one rises through it by dint of one\u2019s conformity to what exists and not through one\u2019s will to change anything. Words like \u201cprogressive\u201d or \u201cmodernising\u201d are only relative and are used sparingly in an organisation reliant entirely upon maintaining archaic tradition for its continuing existence. - The biggest problem that arises from having issued instructions for over one-and-a-half thousand years as if they are God\u2019s eternal rules for mankind is that to have them change and so enable the church to move with the times is to admit they were wrong. It was a while back now but it was troublesome enough for the Catholics to accept astronomers working out how the solar system worked. - Since the Protestant church splintered from the Roman church and a lengthy period of warring between the Roman and the then new Protestant churches resulted from it, the Roman church has been unable to make anything much in the way of change lest it expose itself to accusation of having caused the deaths of thousands without \u201cgood reason\u201d. Thus it is that while the Protestant churches can be quite different from each other, that is to say Protestants can still debate quite what they should be and so give rise to many different strands of Protestantism, the Roman church rather firmly set out its stall five centuries ago and is stuck there. What the Roman church can never do is become Protestant itself, which would effectively be the result of it making any significant change. - The interesting thing will be to see where in the world they draw the next pope from, where they think they can still pretend most effectively that they represent God, where poverty remains a feature of daily life and education is still lacking.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. A perfect example of this is Pope Biggusdickus the 3rd. Ruled with an iron fist. Created 247 cardinals during his 32 year reign but this was mainly to replace those he had assassinated. His successor, Frederico, who took the regnal name of Pope Billybigbum and was believed to be Biggusdickus\u2019s\u2019s\u2019s son by his housekeeper, Sister Anyones, reigned as pope for 43 years, created 248 Cardinals and fathered 27 children. 23 of his sons and 1 daughter were created Cardinals when they came of age. Billybigbum stopped creating cardinals as soon as he he beat his daddy\u2019s record. It did create problems however because Billybigbum was a kindly man, although with a raging libido, and did not assassinate any of the Cardinals and this created an over-supply. This is why many little obscure villages had Cardinals as the local priest. ",
