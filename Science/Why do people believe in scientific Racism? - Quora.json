            "answer_text": "I think even in biology, in the classification of things. under living things, there are also other classification, where we classify organisms into other classes according to ther characteristics  When it comes plants amd animals. Their characteristics differ.at the end of it all,  humans are classified as the most sophisticated organisms and that's because of a thing or two,amongst which is our brains. The brains works with the mind, it makes us have feelings while plants don't. So the argument of biological concept of race been not in existence is really not all that true to me.  People tend not to see the biological concept of race because of what we define race as. We see race as discrimination. Plants have no feelings and humans do. So not everyone really believes in scientific racism based on its definition.  People dont refuse to grow weed because it is abused or refuse to grow cabbages because it has less value than weed economically. And that doesn't make either plant to stop growing because one is sold at a higher price or has more importance than the other. And nothing happens.  But when you decide to be partial in judgement and treatments of certain groups of people in places that they are minority,  there is protest the next day and so on.  So,  people believe in biological concept of racism and others dont.  I don't. ",

            "answer_text": "Ideological primacy. That\u2019s the state of assimilating an idea into your \u201cself\u201d and then believing that idea is a part of your self. Once there, the mental defenses will lash out at any attack on that idea as if you were attacked personally. This can be seen in all sorts of places: Ever see two idiots fight over a sports team?Ever see two idiots fight over whose religion is the right one?Ever see two idiots fight over whose nation is better?Ever see two idiots fight over the inherent value of a political ideology over another?Ever see two idiots fight over a favorite/hated movie?We could go on and on. It is LITERALLY impossible to establish a purely objective value over matters of subjective taste. It almost always comes down to \u201cbecause people say so\u201d. There are objective measures, of course (\u201cthis team wins more games\u201d, \u201cthat fast food chain sells more soylent-burgers\u201d), but that is almost NEVER what people argue about. They assign a value to a thing and then demand that others see it. This is largely a sociological security behavior. When we value a thing, we inherently want others to share that value and get offended when people reject that thing. The more valuable (see: religion) the more vicious the reaction to rejection (duh!). We seek trust mechanisms \u2014 a pedigree that tells us \u201cthis person is safe\u201d. The oldest two being common culture and common religion. (they usually overlap). The Parable of the Well fits best. I approach the only well for miles. I see a man in the distance I don\u2019t recognize. My guard goes up. Could this man rob me? Could he murder me? Who will provide for my kin? As I get closer, I see a similar skin color and the marking on his robes are familiar, but clearly not from my village. Okay this feels a bit better, he\u2019s not from beyond the highlands. But I\u2019m not entirely sure. I hail him as I get within shouting distance. He responds happily. Okay, this feels a bit better, but he has a bit of an accent. It sounds like he\u2019s from the tribe of the north. We know very little about that tribe. This could be dangerous. As I approach further, I give him the greeting of the Moon Goddess, and he smiles back with the same greeting. Now I feel much better. People of the Moon Goddess have almost no history of violence against their own kind. The code of the Moon Goddess is something I know well and her followers are sworn to protect each other and help in time of need. At the well, we connect quickly and it turns out he attended the Festival of Seven Sacrifices to the Moon Goddess three seasons ago, where I was introduced to my future wife. My youngest sister is of age and needs a husband and his youngest brother is of age and needs a wife. This is an opportunity to share between these two families and we agree to meet back at the same well two New Moons from now with our fathers and mothers in order to discuss the matter. That\u2019s just one fictional, but realistic example, of how ethics and common trademarks of our \u201cselves\u201d act as pedigrees of our trust between our kind. History has fluctuated and the definition of our \u201ckind\u201d comes and goes with prosperity. In times of lean, it contracts, perhaps as close as immediate blood. In times of plenty, it expands to incorporate people we\u2019ve never met. So why the \u201cscientific racism\u201d (note: I\u2019m using that term, but there\u2019s no such thing \u2014 there\u2019s only racism based on stupidity). The Nazis attempted \u201cscientific racism\u201d. Primacy was: \u201cOur kind [white, Aryans] are superior, comely, noble, smart, civilized. Those other kind are not. We will confirm that ideology that we already demand as fact [\u201cprimacy\u201d] and the science must be made to support it [confirmation bias; cherry-picking]. As things happen, we will find things that correlate and then call it causation [post hoc ergo propter hoc].\u201d See: Moral Tribes: Emotion, Reason & the Gap Between Us and Them - Joshua Greene ",
