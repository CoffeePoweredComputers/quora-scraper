Belief fixes a granular universe and causes that universe to persist. Nothing can be allowed to change because that way your non-moving universe vanishes. But it moves of itself when you do not move. It evolves beyond you and is no longer accessible to you. The basic rule is this: Never support weakness; always support strength. \"Given a trail of logic, occam's razor laid out with impeccable detail, the Mentat may follow such logic to personal disaster.\" So logic was known to fail. Mentats must have must have a healthy respect for the error-factor in their computations. Bureaucracy destroys initiative. There is little that bureaucrats hate more than innovation, especially innovation that produces better results than the old routines. Improvements always make those at the top of the heap look inept. Who enjoys appearing inept? \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<\u044dgo~~~> Axiomatic History of Humanity (derived from works of Frank Herbert, because i felt like it & totally without permission) [Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense. But the real universe is always one step beyond logic.] [Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.] [A beginning is a time for taking the upmost care to ensure the balances are correct.] [| i shall not fear, |F\u0435\u0430\u044f is the \u043cind-killer.|Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. i shall face my fear. i will allow it to pass over and through me, and when it has gone pas\u0442, i will \u0442u\u044fn the inner-eye to see it's path. There will be nothing. Only I will remain.|] [Do not be trapped by the need to achieve anything. This way, you achieve everything.] [In the beginning, did God create man, or did man create God? This is considered a most important question in regards to the meaning of life, but the answer is that it is not a problem to solve, but a reality to experience.] [As a human beings we are born on the brink of personal destruction, and have to dance along the edge of that cliff all our lives.] [Earth was made to train |\u043du\u043canity|. May our descendants never forget that the line between life & death was sharp & quick.] [Where you work for your own survival, this dominates your imprint, dominates what you believe.] [\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0433\u0435 \u0435\u0445isted no need in some parts of Earth, to build a physical paradise. We could see the actuality of it all around us. And we paid the price men have always paid for achieving paradise in this life. We went soft, we lost our edge.] [You well know the danger of caution! Shield our children too much, and they won't grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny!] [Humankind turned it's thinking over to social machines, in the hope that this would set \u0442\u043d\u0435\u043c free. But this only allowed other humans with social machinery to enslave them.] [the wise despot maintains a feeling in his people that they are helpless & ineffectual, because if they believe this, |they \u0430\u044f\u0435.|] [The historical argument can be made: short-term expediency always fails in the long-term.] [Governments, if they endure, always tend increasingly toward aristocratic forms. No government in history has been known to evade this pattern. And as the aristocracy develops, government tends more and more to act exclusively in the interests of the ruling class \u2014 whether that class be hereditary royalty, oligarchs of financial empires, or entrenched bureaucracy.] [No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero.] [A killer with the manners of a rabbit, that is the most dangerous kind.] [Where are the weapons with which they enforce your slavery? You give it \u0442\u043e \u0442\u043d\u0435\u043c everytime you open your mouth.] [If words are your symbols of reality, you will live in a dream world.] [An offer is only as good as the real thing it buys.] [Religion & politics should never travel in the same cart. Moving faster & faster, they cannot see the cliff until it is too late.] [Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous.] [What religion and self-interest cannot hide, governments can.] [Rulers are notoriously cynical where religions are concerned. Religion, too, is a weapon. What manner of weapon is religion when it becomes the government?] [Religion balances government by being its anti-thesis. But it must be the thing it balances: a government. Those in the middle must watch both, religiously.] [Sacred! As with all things sacred, it gives with one hand & takes with the other! Cynicism!? That, no doubt is a greater crime than heresy.] [Eradicate the dogmatic religions, and you invite them right back into your fold, with every expression of religion forced through a pin-hole: Civil religion.] [Greatness is a transitory experience, never persistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. A person experiencing greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretension. The sardonic is all that allows him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.] [Is it defeatist, or treacherous to diagnose a disease? I only seek to cure the disease.] [How often is it that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is telling him?] [Their Law is a dangerous foundation of inauthentic traditions, and a means to justify false ethics. Anyone charged of a crime should be considered innocent until proven guilty..for the simple fact that it was our government who charged him in the first place.] [|Facts|can be whatever you want them to be. That is the lesson of {\u044felativity.}] [He who seeks to judge should first be asked, \"how are you affornted?\" And from there question inwardly, as well as outwardly.] [Law must retain useful forms to break with tradition, otherwise it merely becomes the justification of the powerful. It must always seek truth, expose prejudice & question justification.] [\"The convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we intend toward each other. Between depriving a man of one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy. Elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill, but behind any use of power over another the ultimate assumption remains: \"I feed on your energy.\"\"] [You cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This power struggle permeates the orthodox community. The leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic.] [And what could be more ridiculous than a death commando transformed into a priest?] [Arm yourself when the frog-god smiles] [Humans are not motivated to mass-violence by a particular belief in God, or the beliefs of those they consider enemies. They will, however, kill impressive numbers for their belief in those that ordered the killing.] [People must come to recognize that the teaching of religion by rules & rote is largely a hoax. \u0442\u043d\u0435 proper \u0442eaching can be recognized with ease, because it will awaken something within you that says this is something you have always known.] [Power tends to isolate those who hold too much of it. Eventually, they lose touch with reality... and fall.] [Religion must remain a |refuge| for those who say |I am not the |\u043du\u043c\u0430n| I want to be|. It must never become an {assemblage of the self-satisfied}] [Respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. Profound, when one considers how unstable the truth can be.] [It is well-known that repression makes religion flourish. This a warning.] [This is the fallacy of power: ultimately it is effective only in an absolute, a limited universe. But the basic lesson of our relativistic universe is that things change. Any power must always meet a greater power.] [Every civilization must contend with an unconscious force which can block, betray or countermand almost any conscious intention of the collectivity.] [I stand here and tell you: \"Yet it moves.\" That which moves can exert its force in ways no mortal power ever before dared stem. I am here to dare this. [All sen\u0442i\u0435n\u0442s are created unequal. The best society provides each with an equal opportunity to float at his own level.] [Give as few orders as possible. The more you control, the more that requires control, this is the road to chaos.] [There exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves. Judging this limit is the true artistry of government. Misuse of power is a fatal sin.] [The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created.] [You cannot threaten an individual and escape the consqences. We pay for the violence of our ancestors.] [Survival is the ability to swim in strange waters.] [When the means of great destruction are widespread, nothing is more dangerous \u0442\u043e the powerful than \u0442\u043e create outrage and injustice. For outrage & injustice will certainly ignite retaliation in kind.] [It must be seen that each humans catastrophe is the catastrophe of all mankind.] [The proper words, spoken at the proper moment, can shift any sentience into astonishing self-awareness] [What do you despise? By this you are truly known.] [You do not take from this universe. It grants you what it will.] [Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and has power.] [We had square thoughts that resisted circles [Fremen must be supreme in their self-imposed delay between desiring a thing...and reaching for it] [Without change, something sleeps inside us, and seldom awakens. The Sleeper must awaken.] [The willow submits to the wind, until one day it is many willows. A wall against the wind.] [The people who can destroy a thing, they control it.] [What's mood got to do with it?! You fight when the need arises, no \u043catter the \u043cood!] [Expect only what happens in the fight, that way you will never be surprised.] [|slow-on-attack|Fast-on-defense| \u0442\u043d\u0435 sole purpose of the initial attack is to force a mistake, to set up for the attack-sinister. A strong defense will turn the fast blade, admit the slow kindjal.] [Behavioral engineering in all forms reduces all (manipulator & manipulated) alike to a deadly mass-effect. |Cultural Revolution, China| Given that humanity is a species which reproduces via generic mingling, such that each individual is a unique specimen, any attempt to impose a decision matrix based on assumed uniform behavioral responses will prove lethal.] [Repeating a statement often, and with great conviction, does not make it true. A logical mind cannot be stolen with falsehoods.] [Atrocity can be recognized by both predator & prey alike. It has no excuse. Each knows it's own limits, and exceeding these could be nothing but disastrous. Atrocity never solves anything, nor rectifies the past. |It only arms the future for further atrocity. Those responsible for atrocity, are responsible for all future atrocity thus created.] [You should never be in the company of anyone with whom you would not want to die.] [We faced it, and did not rail about justice while we still had arms, and freedom enough to use them. The storm surrounded us. We joined with it & become one as it flowed around us. We dissipated it's energy. Now, it is gone. We remain.] [Choose containable violence, if violence cannot be avoided. Better this than epidemic violence.] [The mind can go either way under stress, toward hyper-consciousness at one end of the spectrum, and unconsciousness at the other. How the mind leans is strongly influenced by training.] [It is amazing how many people believe they cannot learn or believe learning to be difficult. But your descendants will learn quickly, because your first training will be in |\u043d\u043ew \u0442\u043e learn|: to acquire the basic trust that you|they|can learn. Your children will know every experience carries its lesson.] [Earth teaches the attitude of the knife, cutting off what is incomplete and saying, \"It is complete, because it is ended here.\"] [There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times to build pyschic muscles.] [A world is supported by four things: The valor of the Brave, the prayers of the Righteous, the learning of the Wise, and the justice of the Great. But those are nothing without those who understand the science of human power & good governance. Make \u0442\u043d\u0430\u0442 the |Science| of your tradition!] [I stand here and tell you: \"Yet it moves.\" That which moves can exert its force in ways no mortal power ever before dared stem. I am here to dare this.] [What of the harmonics intrinsic to prescience & prophecy? Does the prophet see the future, or just a fault-line, a weakness that the right words can shatter like the diamond cutter's knife against a gem?] [One can indeed see the future through prescience. But we should understand the limits of this ability. The vision of time is broad, but as you pass through it, it becomes a narrow door. And always must we avoid the temptation to choose the clear, safe course, leading ever-downward into stagnation & death.] [It is possible to see the danger in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains it own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.] [The Universe is God's. It is one thing, a wholeness against which all separations may be identified. Transient life, even the self-aware and reasoning life which we call sentient, holds only fragile trusteeship on any portion of the wholeness.] [The sequential nature of actual events is not illuminated with lengthy precision by the powers of prescience except under the most extraordinary circumstances. The oracle grasps incidents cut out of the historic chain. Eternity moves. Let them doubt the oracular visions. Let them deny the vision across time. Let them never doubt Eternity.] [What senses do we lack, that we cannot see and hear another world all around us?] [Things persisted in not being what they seemed.] |Fremen\u2022religion|\u2014 An anti-dogmatic structure/axiomatic(statements of truth)21st century religion dedicated to protecting the dignity of |sentients|, educating, training, conditioning human beings to meet an increasingly uncertain future in creative and dynamic ways that focus on helping each individual human learn to generate solutions to problems as they present themselves. The |value of self-government at the individual level can not be overstated.| We know that there are certain |universal truths in the form of axiomatic statements|, self-evidently true. These truths link together to form a |matrix of interconnected axioms| that are true in an absolute way, in regards to humans across all of their existence as humans. And beyond. We accept the fact that the human species will eventually evolve away from some of these truths, and therefore accept that in order to survive in this ever-changing universe, we must allow for our religion to remain adaptable. We must strive to collectively express the adaptability, and the evolutionary capability of our humanitarian religion. |Nothing is sacred, everything is subject to questioning at all times. We must always seek truth, expose all prejudice, and question our own justifications. All information should be examined very carefully, and without judgement.| |We recognize that it is judgement that defeats us.| We know that humanity requires it's guardians, as well as it's violent expressions. These expressions must be channeled appropriately. We know that a killer with the manners of a rabbit is the most dangerous kind of all. We know that harmless people are weak in the face of harmful people of malevolent intent. We know that too few harmful people of moral intent in a society injures that society. We also realize that being fore-armed for violence is one of the best deterrents to violence. Therefore, we will make the human arts of war an integral part of our science of tradition. We will fashion ourselves into human weapons, and channel those expressions productively. As a way & path to self-realization, and physical protection. Outside of clear, and obvious self-defense or the defense of others from imminent attack, |Fremen religion is dedicated to change through non-violence.| Aside from the moral arguments against the use of violence, using it as a tool of policy or change is effectively useless. Our study of human history confirms this. |Violence has never led to the real advancement or liberation of humans.| Fremen religion is to be a religion of Science|the science of religion. It will use it's anti-dogmatic axiomatic structure as a universal truth filter. To clean misleading and/or propagandistic word-delusions from the languages of humans. It will also provide a framework for ethical & moral reasoning that would be extremely difficult to reason out of(once complete). The axiomatic structure demands constant challenge. This is a religion that demands it's integrity be tested, and that its adherent's justify its existence. ",
