            "answer_text": "Yes , why not it can be Negative. From April 2017 kinetic energy can be negative ,you are amazed by my answer if I'm not wrong it's true since, K.E =1/2*m*v^2 That means K.E is directly proportional to m and v How can it be negative when mass can't be negative? Is your question ,but recently in April 2017 a Physicist at Washington State University, and his team created a strange matrial having negative mass . This Negative Mass sounds exactly as it sounds , apparently upending our entire understanding of physics. Negative Mass works exactly as it sounds, and in a way that seems impossible : when you push it, it goes entirely in the opposite direction They did it by cooling down Rubidium atoms so that they were just ever so slightly above Absolute zero -creating a what's so called Bose-Einstein condensate and creating all sorts of bizzare physical effects. In such a state , particles start to move incredibly slowly and act as waves. They can also in unison , flowing without using up any energy. Sorry for the long explanation so K.E is even directly proportional to(-ve ) of m (mass). SO, K.E =1/2(-m)v^2 THANK YOU ",

            "answer_text": "By the commonly defined definition Kinetic Energy[1]is the energy an object is said to posses because of it\u2019s motion. This property is directly proportional to the mass and directly proportional to the square of the velocity: K\u221dmK\u221dm K\u221dv2K\u221dv2 Regardless of whether velocity is positive or negative the square of the velocity will always be positive. The only case I can think of is if the velocity is complex: v=\u221a\u22121=iv=\u221a\u22121=i or v=a+biv=a+bi The only way Kinetic Energy then can be negative, is, if the negative mass[2]from the domain of theoretical physics. From a calculation point of view, one could set up an algebraic scenario where the final calculated result does come out as negative. However, that would be an address from a purely abstract point of view \u2014 removing all real implication of what these variables represent in real life. Kinetic energy is also defined as the work needed to accelerate a stationary object to a stated velocity[3]. Considering the agreed upon definition of Kinetic Energy: what does it mean for a mass to have absolutely zero Kinetic Energy?are Kinetic Energy components separable?how do frames of reference apply to components?Footnotes[1] Kinetic energy - Wikipedia[2] Negative mass - Wikipedia[3] Work (physics) - Wikipedia",

As others here have pointed out, since mass is positive and the square of any real number is positive, the kinetic energy must be positive. However, Work can be negative, as when a force is used to decrease the velocity of an object (friction is an obvious example). And Work is equal to the CHANGE in kinetic energy. So the change in kinetic energy can be negative. But this just means that the object is losing kinetic energy. The kinetic energy values are still positive. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello. Kinetic energy is either zero or positive, never negative. This is because kinetic energy is defined as half an objects' mass multiplied by the square of its velocity. Since mass is a measure of matter, it can never be negative, and since velocity is squared, it is always positive. The kinetic energy of an object is the energy caused by an object's motion; if the object has any type of motion, it has a positive amount of kinetic energy. Unlike some other physics quantities, such as velocity, kinetic energy is not concerned with direction; it's only concerned with magnitude. Because of this, even if an object has \"negative motion\" by moving in a direction opposite to what's considered positive, the sign of the kinetic energy is unaffected. ",
