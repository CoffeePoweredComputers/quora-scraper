            "answer_text": "In the expansion of the universe, there are many theories, theorized for its ending. The most promising of these seems The Big Freeze.  This is also called \u201cThe Heat Death Theory\u201d. For any work to happen, energy is required. This is a basic ;aw of physics concerning energy. However, physicists, from many decades, were puzzled, as to where is the universe getting so much kinetic energy from, to expand since such a long time? The solution for this was found recently, a discovery as big as the black holes, called \u201cThe Dark Energy\u201d.  This is basically the energy and matter, that makes up a *huge* percentage of the space of universe. This matter keeps on providing the universe with (maybe) unlimited energy to grow in size. However, according to the Big Freeze, in a nutshell, it\u2019s said that one day, this energy *will* end. Because infinite energy is simply stated to not be possible, especially emerging from simply a size of an orange (Big Bang). So this theory suggests that one day, all the matter, energy, and entropy will reach their final point, a stationary state, where only \u201cPhantom energy\u201d will remain, for eternity. No more reactions, no more expansions, no more LIGHT! It is said though, that Black Holes\u2019 Accretion disks will continue to be the final sources of light across universe. . . . . . though it\u2019s still a theory lol Image sources: Google Images .

            "answer_text": "The Universe started with the Big Bang, and scientists are ow trying to figure out how it will end. One of the theories is, the Universe may expand forever. This may result in a \u201cbig freeze\u201d. When we say that the Universe is expanding, what is meant is the \u2018space\u2019 that is expanding - currently at the rate of 70 kilometers per second/per Megaparsec - and scientists have noted that the rate of expansion is accelerating. Consequently, the galaxies continue getting further apart from each other, until we may not be able to see any galaxies at all, the universe will get colder and colder because the volume of the Universe is increasing while the mass stays constant. Once entropy reaches its maximum, heat in a system will be distributed evenly as a result of which all mechanical motion all over the Universe will totally cease, and there would be no more energy and the Universe would end by \u2018heat death\u2019. This is known as the \u2018Big Freeze\u2019 as opposed to the \u2018Big Bang\u2019 and is believed to be the most likely end of the Universe. The Universe may not stop expanding. ",
