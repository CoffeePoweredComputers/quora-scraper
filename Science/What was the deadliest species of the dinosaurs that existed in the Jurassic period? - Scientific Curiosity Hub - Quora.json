            "answer_text": "Deadly could mean different things to different species. But the confirmed largest and deadliest would probably go to Torvosaurus. That said, Allosaurus fragilus and other species of allosaurus were more common and could possibly reach the same size as Torvosaurus. \u201cPOSSIBLY\u201d. Allosaurs average about 27\u201329 feet and rather gracile compared to Torvosaurus. Another contender is Saurophaganax, but enough remains to give a confirmed size and identification of species are lacking. Saurophaganax is a large theropod very similar to Allosaurus and is either another species, an abnormally large Allosaurus or a new genus altogether that has been named Saurophaganax. At this time it is considered a new genus and estimated lengths vary from 33 -40 feet. Torvosaurus has a confirmed upper length of 33 feet and is more robust than the Allosaurids. ",

            "answer_text": "Deadliest? To what? The largest and most powerful dinosaurs and the most deadly to plant life were sauropod dinosaurs in general. These included Omeisaurus, Mamenchisaurus, Giraffititan, Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Diplodocus, Supersaurus and Brachiosaurus, some of the biggest animals to ever live The deadliest predators were theropods, namely Torvosaurus, Allosaurus, and Saurophaganax. These were enormous predators that hunted sauropods And of course I would not fancy anyone\u2019s odds against a Stegosaur in a fight, especially the biggest Stegosaurus. ",
