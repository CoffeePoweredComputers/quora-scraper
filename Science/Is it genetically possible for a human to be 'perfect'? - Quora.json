            "answer_text": "The problem is that genetics doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s all trade-offs and balancing acts. There\u2019s no \u201cperfect\u201d, merely a whole lot of \u201cgood enoughs\u201d. For example: you might think that having a super-high intelligence would be something to include in your \u201cperfect human\u201d. So why haven\u2019t we evolved it already? Probably because if the intelligence gets *too* high, you start hitting all sorts of cognitive hazards. Memorable Movie Death #3: Vizzini From Princess Bride That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re too smart - you can overthink yourself to death. Another example: humans are not the fastest animal on land when measured over short distances. Not even close. Evolving to walk upright and make hands more usable meant that we could never hope to match speeds with a four-legged animal. However\u2026 walking upright and having a good brain means you can invent and carry a spear. And that\u2019s a game changer. There\u2019s a lot of carnivores that can outrun a human - but most of them have enough sense to leave a human with weapons alone. And walking upright is a game changer in another way. Our hip design guarantees we can\u2019t out-sprint animals. But it\u2019s damned efficient. We can run marathons. Ultra-marathons of 50 and 100 miles. And that\u2019s a game changer too. See that gazelle? It\u2019s going to be lunch. It may take a while, but it\u2019s going to happen. Pick up your spear, and run towards the gazelle. It, of course, runs off. Keep running. You get close again, and it runs off again, but not as fast. Do this 20 or 30 times, and you may not even need the spear - the gazelle may literally drop dead of exhaustion. And having found that niche of being able to run further than anything else on the plains of Africa, we acquired a bunch of other features. We lost almost all our body hair, making it easier to stay cool while chasing that antelope for 3\u20134 hours in the Serengeti heat. That\u2019s going to come back and bite us in the butt in a few hundred thousand years when our descendants try to live in Europe, but by then they\u2019ll have learned how to skin animals that *do* have fur and make clothing. Ever wonder why getting even a minor cut on the head bleeds so much? It\u2019s because the blood vessels in our head take a weird path. To keep our brain cool while running in the heat, the blood vessels go up and around the *outside* of the skull where the blood can cool off before going to the brain. Yeah, it means you can lose a lot of blood from a minor wound - but back on the plains of Africa, getting that sort of wound probably meant that you\u2019d encountered a carnivore that wasn\u2019t afraid of a primate with a spear. If that happens, that scalp wound is the least of your problems.. And it\u2019s the same sort of thing all the way down. Trade-offs all over the place, over even the most basic things. Be warm-blooded? You can live in cold places - but your food requirements just went up by a factor of 10 or more. An alligator can live for over a year off one good meal, we don\u2019t have that option. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps. It is postulated that the human race receives periodic DNA/gene upgrades, whereby our human DNA/genes are combined with alien DNA/genes (through gene splicing, working in conjunction with In Vitro Fertilization, or other unknown alien genetic engineering/reproductive techniques). Ethnic Cleansing may occur, initiated by these aliens, to remove the inferior humans, and their genes, from the human gene pool. If these alien beings are perfect, then we could one day be perfect too, theoretically, as long as the aliens continue to upgrade us. The aliens, I suspect, would have to be of such high moral/ethical character that they are not in need of saviors (e.g. Jesus Christ and Joan of Arc). Otherwise, they would not be perfect. They may be gods (sub-persons) of the divine Trinity 3 persons. A perfect earthly body would be a terrible thing to have, after the Fall of Man, since it would theoretically live on forever. Could our sinful/fallen souls/spirits then be trapped within these perfect earthly bodies, never to be liberated into heavenly bodies and perfected souls/spirits? Is this why the angel guarded access to the TREE OF LIFE in the Garden of Eden? If humans had eaten of this fruit, their bodies would have lived on forever. But our sinful nature would have been trapped within these perfect bodies, And us, eternally separated from God. The Anunnaki are referred to as aliens in modern times, but as deities in ancient Sumerian culture. I have no problem with them being deities (gods - lower case) because I believe that the divine Trinity is composed of 3 divine persons (Father - Most High God, Son - High God, and Holy Spirit - God) forming the Godhead. I believe that each of these divine persons form sub-persons within each of their divine group taxa. Example: Moses and Elijah and John the Baptist would be examples of sub-persons of Jesus (2nd person) within the Son of God/Man divine group taxon. We see this evidenced at the Mount of Transfiguration where Moses and Elijah appeared together in all their glory with Jesus. Jesus is a \u201cKind\u201d of divine being embodying the entire divine gene pool for his divine \u201cKind\u201d. \u201cKind\u201d can be compared to \u201cGenus\u201d or \u201cFamily\u201d in the taxonomy/classification of living things. Moses, Elijah, and John the Baptist can be considered \u201cspecies\u201d of divine beings, or gods. There are also goddesses in the divine Trinity e.g. Mary Magdalene and Joan of Arc. THUS: The Anunnaki may be gods (sub-persons) of the divine Trinity sent to further advance humanity both morally and ethically by an upgrade of our DNA infused with divine DNA. ",

I have met men who were really good at sports AND really smart but they died early. I have met people who were mentally challenged but very happy and very strong. I have always wanted to be taller but my taller friends and brothers had back problems and foot problems. I had an uncle that was 6\u20135\u2033 and very smart (Chemist) and made 3 million in the stock market. He was a very nice guy and lived to be 95 years old, But he would not let my aunt correct the children which ruined their marriage and made home life very difficult.

And look what a great inventor he became, giving poor farmers popular products to make a living. ",
