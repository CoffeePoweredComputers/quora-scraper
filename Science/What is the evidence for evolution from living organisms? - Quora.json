            "answer_text": "There are two ways we can use living organisms to deduce the fact of evolution (that is, the fact that living things are related to each other by a tree of descent with modifications from a common ancestor) First, we can use morphology, or organisms\u2019 anatomy and generally observable shape. It was obvious to most people long before Darwin that organisms fall into clear categories like \u2018bird\u2019 and \u2018snake\u2019, and the more we learned about those organisms\u2019 bodies the more clear it became that those categories form branching patterns: all mammals have fur and milk, but some give birth early and rear their offspring in pouches, while others give birth later and don\u2019t have a pouch; and of those, only some have gnawing teeth, or cloven hoofs, or opposable thumbs. In general, the more you examine organisms, the more obvious it becomes where they belong in this branching structure. This is a unique feature of living things. Most of the time, when you examine things they don\u2019t fall into a unique branching classification. We can often create such a classification, but it\u2019s arbitrary. There are alternative classifications that work just as well, and the more you learn about the objects you\u2019re classifying, the more difficult it becomes to fit them all in. So the branching structure of living things, which is not arbitrary but an essential feature, requires some explanation. Despite all this, it\u2019s true that some organisms are still hard to classify by morphology alone. In general, the simpler an organisms is, the fewer interesting features it has by which we can fit it into the structure. There are an awful lot of \u2018worm-like\u2019 creatures, for example. This is where the second method comes in, genetics. With the discovery of DNA, we became able to examine the relationship between organisms on a much more precise and quantitative basis. We can take any two organisms and compare their DNA directly, searching for similar sequences. This is much more effective than morphology alone, and for living organisms at least it has taken over almost entirely from morphology as a means of classification (it\u2019s no use for fossils, though). Using genetics, we were able not just to confirm the branching relationships in the previous classification (a huge confirmation of the theory) but sort out some of those more tricky organisms that were previously difficult to classify.

            "answer_text": "Two areas often pointed to include morphology (Physical similarities) and genetics (Code similarities). These two arguments have weaknesses as well. First, many organisms once assumed to be related (common ancestry or transmutated) based on physical appearances are genetically very dissimilar. Secondly, the Universal Genetic code reveals specified information which builds living organisms using a code like language- this does not seem to be what random, blind, and spontaneous nature would \u201ccreate\u201d. Third, similarity in physical form does not equate to transmutation. Forth, only 2% of DNA is used for protein formation (genes) and the similarities exist when forms are similar physically- no surprise here. It is the remaining 98% of DNA function that makes the largest differences in organisms at the family order (or higher). Fifth, diversity in organisms (only observed in the same species- transmutation has never been observed) is known to be driven by the mechanism DNA allele \u201cfrequencies\u201d which simply are dominant or recessive gene variants. These alleles are very accurately passed from parents to offspring at an astounding 99.999999% accurate. Those that believe in transmutation are banking on a 0.000001% chance. Sixth, mutations that do pass to DNA alleles- all of them that are detected- are damaging causing illness, cancers, disease, and even death. Transmutation is a belief thought to be strong but the objective science behind it is nonexistent. ",
