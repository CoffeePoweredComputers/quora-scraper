            "answer_text": "Hydrogen peroxide burns when introduced into open wounds because it is damaging healthy cells, causing a \"distress signal\" to the brain in the form of burning pain. It damages the cells that are trying to repair the injury, and the small blood vessels that are essential to rapid healing. These are the reasons that current medical practice is to irrigate wounds with clean water only, and to clean the intact skin around the wound with mild soap and water. The myth that hydrogen peroxide prevents infection should be abandoned. ",

            "answer_text": "It doesn't. It is non-flammable. Hydrogen peroxide doesn't burn but is an oxidizer which promotes combustion. At a high enough concentration, it can decompose releasing oxygen and creating a fire when it contacts a flammable or combustable material. At a concentration of about 50% H2O2 is called HTP and is very dangerous since it can spontaneously decompose. At about 70%, the decomposition is enough to cause the material to turn completely to steam and oxygen. ",
