            "answer_text": "To answer this question we must first figure out how likely the modern world and technology is actually going to last, and if it lasts, how quickly it will change. Of all the technologies humans have ever created, probably only 4 have had any noticeable lasting effects on evolution, and those would be stone tools, fire clothing, and agriculture, and these have been around for 3 million, 1.5 million, 100,000 and 10,000 years respectively, roughly, without a huge amount of fundamental change for a significant stretch of those runs. Everything else has either not endured long enough or changed to something else too quickly to create any noticeable effect. The future direction and duration of technological change is notoriously hard to accurately predict, so this question probably cannot be answered at the present time. As for the finger thing, that is no more evolution than a scar is evolution. ",

            "answer_text": "Very good question. First of all, don't apply \u2018evolution\u2019 into everything in human life and progress that human\u2019s are making in the development of science and technology. Evolution the evolutionists are talking about is confined to the \u201corigin of species by natural selection\u201d only. The term Evolution has a different meaning when you want to use that term outside the perview of the \u2018Darwin's theory of evolution\u2019. Don't mix it up. Secondly, human beings are NOT THE PRODUCT OF EVOLUTION. There is no inherent and intrinsic characteristic is found any of the closest ancestors the evolutionary scientists are suggesting. Perhaps, it might take Billions of years to any such thing to happen or it might never happen at all. So who are humans? Are they evolved or created? We have to reason it out. Till today the theory of evolution has not been proved scientifically yet. They claim that they have stacks of evidences and tones of proofs. When they were asked to produce one tangible and verfiable evidence on the table, they are unable to produce anything till now. The scientific and technological developments are the highest achievements of human intelligence which is given to them by a supernatural being who is otherwise called God, who is the source of all intelligence and wisdom. If it were to be the product of evolution, it would have taken at least millions of years, but factually this development took only few hundred years since the 15 th century. So, the fact of the matter is, human beings are not evolved, but created and are totally different from the rest of the 5 million species existing in the planet earth. Think of the wonderful, extraordinary and intelligent characteristics you possess over all other species and organisms living on the planet earth. ",
