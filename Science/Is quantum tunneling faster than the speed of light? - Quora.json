            "answer_text": "So you've just watched an episode of PBS Space Time \"Is Quantum Tunneling Faster than Light?\". Under the video they give a link to the (1993!) paper they described: Measurement of the single-photon tunneling time Where the abstract says: \"Although the apparent tunneling velocity (1.7\u00b10.2)c is superluminal, this is not a genuine signal velocity, and Einstein causality is not violated. The measured tunneling time is consistent with the group delay (\u2018\u2018phase time\u2019\u2019), but not with the semiclassical time.\" ",

            "answer_text": "No, you cannot use quantum mechanics for sending information faster than light. It doesn't matter if you are using tunneling or entanglement. If you could send information faster than light from your frame of reference then there is another frame where you are sending the signal back in time. The only way we can have consistancy with causality is if information travels within the light cones. Quantum mechanics has been superseded by quantum field theory, which is naturally relativistic.
