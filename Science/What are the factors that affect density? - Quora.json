            "answer_text": "The density of an object or quantity of matter is its mass divided by its volume. This is usually measured under standard conditions for temperature and pressure: 0\u00b0C and 1 atmosphere of pressure. One factor affecting the density of a material is how concentrated the atoms are in a given volume. In some cases, materials made of atoms with a lower atomic weight have a greater density than those with a higher atomic weight, due to the atoms being more tightly packed. This is especially true for solids. The atoms in some materials\u2014especially solids\u2014are closely packed compared to those of other materials. Thus, it is possible for a material made of atoms of a lower atomic number to be heavier than that of a high atomic number for a given volume. A good example is the comparison of the elements Tin and Manganese. Tin has the atomic number of 50 and the atomic weight of 118.7 \u03bc (atomic mass unit or Dalton), while Manganese is number 25 with an atomic weight of 54.9 \u03bc. However, Tin has a lower density at 7.31 g/cm3, while the density of Manganese is 7.43 g/cm3. In other words, even though the mass of Manganese atoms are one-half that of Tin, its density is higher than Tin. Change in volume The volume of a material can change with temperature and pressure. This, in turn, changes the density of the material. As the temperature increases, most materials expand or increase their volume. This results in a decrease in density. Likewise, when the temperature goes down, the density usually becomes greater. When a material changes its phase or state of matter, its volume and thus its density usually changes. Although pressure can influence the change of state of a material, temperature is the main factor. ",

            "answer_text": "Concentration of atoms: An important factor in determining the density of a material is its mass for a given volume. Although you would think the total mass would only be a function of the material's atomic weight (relative atomic mass), it is not always the case. The atoms in some materials\u2014especially solids\u2014are closely packed compared to those of other materials. Thus, it is possible for a material made of atoms of a lower atomic number to be heavier than that of a high atomic number for a given volume. Tin and Manganese: A good example is the comparison of the elements Tin and Manganese. Tin has the atomic number of 50 and the atomic weight of 118.7 \u03bc (atomic mass unit or Dalton), while Manganese is number 25 with an atomic weight of 54.9 \u03bc. However, Tin has a lower density at 7.31 g/cm3, while the density of Manganese is 7.43 g/cm3. In other words, even though the mass of Manganese atoms are one-half that of Tin, its density is higher than Tin. Change in volume: The volume of a material can change with temperature and pressure. This, in turn, changes the density of the material. Density and temperature: As the temperature increases, most materials expand or increase their volume. This results in a decrease in density. Likewise, when the temperature goes down, the density usually becomes greater. For example, at normal atmospheric pressure, air at 0 \u00b0C has a density of \u03c1 =1.29 kg/m3. But at 10 \u00b0C, the density of air is \u03c1 =1.25 kg/m3, which is slightly less. It is important to state the temperature of a material, because it is a factor in density. Density and pressure: Air pressure or the pressure from a container can change the volume and thus the density of an object. Pressure affects the density of gazes the most. For example, the density of air is 1.225 kg/m3 or 0.001225 g/cm3. However, when confined in a balloon, the density can be much greater. At a given temperature and at atmospheric pressure, solids and liquids will have a specific volume. By increasing the pressure on the material, you can often slightly decrease its volume and thus increase its density. Unfortunately, most solids and liquids do not readily compress, so that method is not effective in changing the density. ",

            "answer_text": "There are several factors affecting the density of a object. I will tell in brief: Temperature - Since density is mass per unit volume it will change if the volume changes (mass can\u2019t change until you add some more of the same material to it, which same as increasing the volume and decrease it in the same way). Volume can change when you heat or cool the substance down. S, temperature is a important factor.Pressure - Look imagine you take a glass of water from earth to space it vaporise as soon as possible due to absence of pressure. What happens to its density? it decreases since the volume has increased enormously. This was a example. Even if you decrease temperature by a little the density decreases and if you increase the pressure the density increases. Please do not confuse this with regelation. It occurs only with water (it is only a phenomena of ice).I hope the answer helps. If there are any mistakes please do correct it, i will be greatly obliged. ",

            "answer_text": "The 4 factors affecting the density of matter are its state of matter, air pressure, temperature and geometry of its molecules. The state of matter includes whether the body is solid, liquid or gas. Solids usually have higher density than liquids and gases. Gases have the least densities. The air pressure if higher compress the body into smaller sizes and if lower remove the compressing force. The temperature if very high expand the material into bigger sizes thus lowering its density. Very low temperature makes the molecules closer thus decreasing the size of the body. Smaller volumes implies increase in density. The geometry of molecules refer to how the molecules are arranged in a body. Ice has a geometry that has wide air gaps between the molecules thus expanding its volume when frozen. This lowers its density when compared to liquid water where the wide air gaps are not existing.
