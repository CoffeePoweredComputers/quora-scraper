            "answer_text": "The ball and planet earth form a system that has a centre of mass somewhere near the centre of the planet. When you lift the ball off the ground you also lift the planet off the ball. You don\u2019t notice this because the ball moves much further than the planet due to the huge mass of the planet compared to the small mass of the ball. It would be much more obvious if you were standing on a car sized rock in space and lifting another rock of a similar size. When you drop a ball both the ball and the earth move and the total momentum of the system is conserved. ",

            "answer_text": "When the ball strikes the ground, the earth starts moving in the direction of the strike. Consider the earth to be staionary just before impact. momentum of ball just before impact = momentum of ball and earth just after impact. Of course if you think about it from the point of release of the ball- the earth pulls the ball doewn and the ball pulls the earth up so momentum is conserved at every instant. Then when the ball hits the ground, the force on the ball on the force on the earth are equal in magnitude and operate for the same amount of time. So momentum is conserved. ",
