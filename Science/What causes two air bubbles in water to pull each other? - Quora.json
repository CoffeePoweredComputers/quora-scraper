If they happen to encounter one another, say one \u201cfloats up\u201d faster, the bubbles produce less pressure when combined into one larger one, so it is more stable, releases energy, when they combine into one larger bubble.

Some bubbles combine because the surface tension is not strong enough to repel the electrical forces that are attracting them to each other\u2026. Not a scientist, but based on what I remember about what I was taught! ",
