            "answer_text": "Fish gills do not break apart water molecules to separate the oxygen atoms out of H2O water. Gills filter gaseous O2 molecules out of the liquid water molecules they were mixed into. If there is no gaseous O2 molecules mixed into the water, the fish will suffocate just as we would if the air we were breathing did not contain O2 molecules. Excessive fertilizers getting into bodies of water and causing an algae bloom thick as green pea soup means the O2 is rapidly being stripped out of the water, and all forms of oxygen breathing life in the water will die. When water gets stirred up, either by wind causing waves, or currents making rapids or falls or whirlpools, or humans creating fountains or bubbling air through water, oxygen molecules from the air get mixed into the water, which is what is meant by the term \u201cdissolved oxygen content\u201d of water that is what almost all aquatic life needs to survive, and why oxygen-free areas of water are referred to as dead zones, because anything that needs oxygen to live that doesn\u2019t get out of such water quickly enough will die a painful suffocating death.

            "answer_text": "Water is a solvent. That means, it can dissolve things. This would also mean it can dissolve a lot of gases. Air is a mixture of gases, one of them including oxygen. Air is relatively richer in oxygen than water. When air and water meet, the difference in their oxygen concentration causes some oxygen to dissolve in the water. This usually occurs when you disturb the water surface, a principle used in air pumps of aquariums. When air pumps pump air bubbles into the water, it rises up, disturbing the surface and causing oxygen to dissolve. Now, fishes take that dissolved oxygen and use it. They don't turn H2OH2O into H2H2 and oxygen since you'd be breaking a molecule if you do that, not to mention it takes a lot of energy. Overall, the fish use the dissolved oxygen in water. ",

Fishes take in oxygen that is dissolved in water, they do not actually start breaking down the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Now just think for a minute here, if this was what was really happening, why do you think people are sgit scared about the rising level of water in oceans and seas.Fishes could take care of it they just eat up the oxygen and the hydrogen escapes. It's not that simple a process sir, breaking water requires energy, a lot of energy as the process is not favourable. The energy needed is somewhere in the proximity of 280kj per mole of water. Now just to show how large this energy is, just know that one gram of gasoline(petrol) gives 47 kj of energy.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis_of_water ",
