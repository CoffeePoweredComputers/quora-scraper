            "answer_text": "Well, a life lived without reflection may not be aware of much. Aside from that - look at the sunrise. Not with a mirror now. Squint for a minute, work with me. If you see the sun, that\u2019s light that came from the sun to your eye in more or less straight line. No reflections. If the gist of your question was whether objects are only visible to us due to reflected or scattered light, that is a bit closer to \u2018yes\u2019. You can still see an object that\u2019s on fire, or glowing red hot, so things that are emitting visible photons can also be seen (like the sun). For things not innately glowing, the act of your eye seeing them will mean that some light source is hitting the object with enough photons, which subsequently scatter / reflect into your eyes, that your brain constructs \u2018seeing\u2019 that object in a way that\u2019ll probably be consistent in how it \u2018looks\u2019 as you move around it, make shadows on it, and the like. Part of the opposite side of the coin there is that non-visible light can also reflect and scatter (and \u2018glow\u2019 directly from some objects. That facet is not visible to us without help from night vision goggles, or radar dishes, or other artificial aids to detecting photons our human eyes don\u2019t pick up on. (You may be able to take your pet Mantis Shrimp along as a detector for some such light. They have over a dozen light receptors in their eyes, compared to the three for humans, and can see significantly into the IR and UV, relative to us) ",
