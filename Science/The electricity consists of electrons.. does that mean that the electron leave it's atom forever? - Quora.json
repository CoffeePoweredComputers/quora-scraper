            "answer_text": "In technical we were taught to think differently about this than the physicists. This is the gist of how we were taught. There are many atomic bonds but for electrical purposes the most important is the metallic bond. You may think of electrons as charge carriers, and also as small ball bearings which orbit around larger ones, the nuclei of atoms, and in a metallic bond they wander around constantly leaving the orbit of one nuclei to go on to the next. This happens in random patterns quite naturally, and spaces are left on the outer shells of the atoms for electrons to be accepted when one is donated to an adjacent atom. If we apply an electro-motive force, that is a voltage - we can make this wandering in a uniform direction, rather as magnetising iron causes the individual fields in the iron to line up creating a stronger magnetic field. Physicists will scoff at such a theory but for electrical engineers and technicians it\u2019s a very useful way of imagining what goes on in a conductor and helps you to apply it practically. Applying it to your question you will see that an electron in the outer shell does not have an atom to call its own and is constantly on the move. Copper is the most widely used conductor and here is an old diagram of the atom, I\u2019d like to credit where this comes from but I\u2019ve had this in my notes for so long now that I can\u2019t remember any more:  If you look in the bottom right hand corner you\u2019ll see the singular electron inhabiting the fourth shell outwards. It\u2019s this one that constantly migrates. ",

            "answer_text": "Most of the outer shell electrons in a metallic atom are so loosely bound that to a very good approximation, they can be considered free and wandering from atom to atom, specially under the influence of an electric field. They collide with other atoms and are thrown back and then again go further. Thus the \u201cdrift\u201d velocity is very small, around 10^(-5) m/s not at all comparable with the speed with which electric field (voltage difference) travels , essentially velocity of light (3 x 10^8 m/s). I will take this opportunity to clarify one other misconception, although you are not asking it. Lot of people think that you are getting current (electrons) travelling from power company to your house. This is not true ! What you are paying for is the electric field (coming from voltage difference). Because of the alternating voltage , the electrons are pushed back and forth. Since the drift velocity is so small, a typical electron in a switch does not leave the switch! So basically you are using only the electrons which came with the house wiring when you paid for the house!! But since the electric field travels at the speed of light, the bulbs light up almost instantaneously as the switch is turned own. Tube lights take little longer because they are based on electrons travelling from one electrode to another and hitting and exciting gas atoms on the way. Light is emitted when these atoms are deexcited. ",
