            "answer_text": "The 1st thing you must understand is that religions are of 2 types , History centric religions and religions based on something called embodied knowing . This means that religions based on history are focussed on how God actually gave messages to the prophets and the only way to access the truth is to maintain the historicity of prophets. The institution that maintains this historicity is very important. In case of Christianity it is a church , in case of Islam it is a tradition of Hafiz also Judaism has it's own way of maintaining the Historicity. Such faiths generally turn out to be book based, inflexible, unable to adapt to changing times and often turn out to be violent. They would generally hold themselves to be the light bearers of truth. Now the other types of faith are those that are based on embodied knowing which means that every human being has the potential to actually know the ultimate reality , the person does not need to rely on an institution. The faiths that have this concept are Hinduism, Buddhism , Jainism and to a certain extent Sikhism. Such faiths ask the person to concentrate on individual liberation, they generally have aspects that tell you go get out of pre-conceived notions hence these religions can be considered to beore scientific and honest in their approach. For example Jainism accepts that there are various aspects to truth and allow exploration. ",
