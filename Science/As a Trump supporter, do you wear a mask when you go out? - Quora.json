            "answer_text": "I wear one wherever they are mandated or necessary to be able to remain within a location which I need or want to remain in, temporarily. (Such as in a store or other location; I don\u2019t own the locale, therefore I don\u2019t get to make the rules there, and as a Trump supporter I also respect other people\u2019s property and requirements or wishes for being on their property, and I also don\u2019t want to make anyone uncomfortable or cause a scene, etc). So for me that translates to: I wear one briefly while in Walgreens, Target, or any other store that really would either make you wear one or presumably ask you to leave if you won\u2019t. I take it off the moment I\u2019m out the door; I don\u2019t wear it when I go into my local corner gas station because the East Indian attendants there don\u2019t really care either way. I wore one at the doctor\u2019s office waiting room for routine check-up the other day (and I think dr\u2019s waiting rooms are an appropriate place for these, at the moment). I would wear one on a plane for now. I went to a friend\u2019s wedding at a Greek Church the other weekend and they required one in the church during the ceremony so I wore one during the ceremony. I do not and will not wear one: while driving my car; while out walking around in any outdoor/open places outside; while exercising outside; while visiting in private with close family or a few select long-known old friends (as long as no one is feeling ill, coughing, and/or has not had any known recent \u2018exposure\u2019 event). And, at the aforementioned wedding a couple weeks ago (which was an entirely privately held affair with about 50 people), no one was really wearing them once the \u201creception\u201d began, so neither did I. I wasn\u2019t going to be the only one, that\u2019s for sure. And I made it! Hand-washing and sanitizer before the food, no doubt, however. Oh boy, a survivable event, a wedding reception, and even a few plates from the open antipasto table. And to think my immediate ancestors only made it through world wars, a famine, previous pandemic(s), and Dachau. ",

However, if I get to a shop and no one in the shop is wearing a mask then I won\u2019t wear a mask either; if I\u2019m strolling in public, I won\u2019t wear it - I teach my children the same. The mask is a tool of manipulation; it cannot prevent a virus from infecting you and the RT PCR test was not designed to test for viruses, so even the supposed cases are just cases of the test and not the virus, so I won\u2019t even submit to testing; we were sick just last week, took our herbal remedies and are quite fine now. I ain\u2019t gonna to willing submit to enslavement. ",
