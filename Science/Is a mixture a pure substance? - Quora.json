            "answer_text": "There is two ways to answer this. If you say that the molecules within a mixture are uniformly the same seperation and density throughout the material, then the answer is yes. This sounds only like an \u201cideal\" mixture. Mixtures are not usually uniform and not evenly distributed on the molecular level. This would lead to an answer of no. I believe if you looked at most mixtures, you would see they more fit the second category. So, most of the time, your answer should be no to this question. ",
