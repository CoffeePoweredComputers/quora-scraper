            "answer_text": "Starting from historical views, John Dalton in (nearly) 1808 gave the \u201cDalton\u2019s Atomic Theory\u201d which stated that the matter consists of smallest fundamental particles called atoms which cannot be further subdivided (and various other postulates which are not of much use here). But now, most of the Postulates of the Dalton\u2019s Atomic Theory have been proved wrong. Later, A British Physicist Ernest Rutherford performed an Alpha Particle Scattering experiment in which he bombarded a very very thin foil of gold (due to it\u2019s high malleability) with a stream of alpha particles and noted that most of the alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil (note that the gold foil was made so thin that it consisted of only a single layer of atoms), few were deflected by small angles and very few (about 1 in 20,000) were completely deflected back to their original path. Based on the above experiment, he proposed the \u201cRutherford\u2019s Atomic model\u201d according to which, an atom consists of a large central nucleus (as few of the alpha particles were deflected by small angles and a very few completely) and a large (note that \u201clarge\u201d, here has been used comparatively to the volume of the nucleus) space between the nucleus and the outermost shell (since most of the alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil). Now, the base for your answer has been created so moving straight back to your question, What is an atom? An atom is the smallest fundamental particle which can exist independently (while it normally doesn\u2019t, the inert gases being an exception). How is it 99.9% empty? Well, you can\u2019t exactly say about the percentage of it being empty, but the total volume of atom is much larger compared to the volume of the nucleus. You may imagine the atom as a cricket ground and the nucleus as a cricket ball kept at it\u2019s center. Later, the Rutherford\u2019s model was also proved wrong and many other atomic models came after that. According to the current atomic model, the shell of the atom is also divided into subshells which further consists of orbitals (We need not go into much detail as I hope you got your answer). ",

            "answer_text": "There are four fundamental forces of nature identified by physics as gravitation (mass), electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear. Although these four fundamental forces are very different from each other, they interact and in doing so, they generate fields which oscillate. Via the peaks of the oscillations - quantum excitations of the field - the fields in turn interact to generate all phenomena. Atoms are one such phenomenon expressing the interactions of all four fundamental forces. An atom is not empty at all. This was a wrong concept taught many years ago when the atom was first conceptualized, not as fields of interacting fundamental forces, but (erroneously) as a collection of fundamental \u201cparticles\u201d, a holdover word from the previous iteration of physics. The concept of particles has been superseded by the concept of fields and their quantum excitations. The nucleus of an atom is packed with extremely dense energy fields called quarks and gluons. The nucleus is surrounded by a very \u201cfluffy\u201d (not dense) electron field, which is charged. There is no empty space there at all, this is a misconception. When a give volume of space is emptied of atoms, it is called a vacuum, or vacuum space. It is empty of atoms, but still filled to the brim with fields. There is no location anywhere that is utterly devoid of fields. All space is filled with quantum fields - photons and neutrinos - and contiguous fields - EM and gravitation - regardless of whether there are any atoms present. Two atoms cannot occupy the same space at the same time because of the repulsion of their respective bound EM fields. When forces such as gravitation forces atoms to crush into each other and that overcomes the resistance of the EM fields, the resulting \u201csoup\u201d is no longer atoms. This action is what results in neutron stars, stars not made of atoms but only neutrons as the electron fields have been crushed into the nuclei, combined with protons to produce neutrons, and release a lot of photons (gamma). The old image of the \u201cempty\u201d atom persists, but is wrong. ",
