            "answer_text": "The \u201cparticle\u201d you refer to regarding gravitation would be called a graviton, and it cannot be detected because its energy content is so vanishingly small it is undetectable. The rule is, the less the energy content, the more energy needed to detect it. There isn\u2019t enough energy on the planet to power the machine that could detect a graviton. However, we have good reason to consider gravitons as real entities, but we can\u2019t call them \u201cparticles\u201d. We have to call them quantum excitations of the oscillating gravitational field, a description derived from QFT. LIGO detected the predicted gravitational waves five years ago. The waves indicate that the gravitational field oscillates and according to QFT, the peaks of the oscillations of an oscillating field are the quantum excitations of that field. Thus we can rest assured that the graviton is a real \u201cthing\u201d, as real as any quantum excitation of any field. But we cannot detect them; big deal, so what. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s an animated GIF of LIGO, the detector that earn a Nobel prize for its leads. At first there is no wave, and the distances between the mirrors are carefully calibrated so that the (blue) light cancels by interference and does not proceed to the detector (bottom right). Then a wave passes through space-time (the green voxels). This alternating compression/expansion of space (the wave) results in the blue light experiencing slightly different travel distance between the mirrors. Then the interference no longer cancels, and some light makes it to the detector.  ",
