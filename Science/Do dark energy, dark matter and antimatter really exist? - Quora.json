            "answer_text": "Do dark energy, dark matter, and antimatter really exist? Dark energy and antimatter exist. \u201cDark matter\u201d does not. \u201cDark matter\u201d is an effect of dark energy as explained below. There is no evidence that any \u201cdark matter\u201d particles exist. All the evidence for \u201cdark matter\u201d is of the accelerations of galaxies, on galactic scales only, where \u201cdark energy\u201d undeniably can accelerate galaxies. Modified Newtonian dynamics was an even worse hypothesis. The accelerations of galaxies are a result of Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle of general relativity. You cannot understand dark energy, or its \u201cdark matter\u201d effects, without a deep understanding of relativity, relativistic mass, and Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle. Unfortunately, this deep understanding is woefully lacking in today\u2019s physicists. For much more on dark matter, dark energy, dark fluid, and redshift, please see my answers below to the following questions: If dark matter cannot be measured, does it actually exist or is it simply an idea? \u201cDark matter\u201d has not been detected and that is because it does not exist. It was a good hypothesis that has failed to materialize. We now know that it is completely unnecessary because the \u201cdark matter\u201d effects can be produced by a negative mass \u201cdark fluid,\u201d eliminating any need for additional \u201cdark matter\u201d particles. The following publication has caused a media frenzy: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07962... I was the first to discover that dark energy and dark matter could both be explained by negative mass and published it on May 13, 2018. My thesis gives many more details on this \u201cdark fluid\u201d including what it is and its quantum mechanical properties: Dark Energy - Dark Matter, A Treatise on their Unified Cause and Effects. Only enough of this \u201cdark fluid\u201d is needed to overcome the regular matter in our universe (not 95%). A brief summary follows: Dark energy is the name given to that which causes the accelerated expansion of our universe. According to Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle of general relativity, acceleration is indistinguishable from gravity. So dark energy is also indistinguishable from gravity. Gravity is associated with mass, and negative gravity would be associated with negative mass. \u201cIn 1918, before famously discarding the cosmological constant, Einstein made the first physical interpretation of the new \u039b term that he had discovered: \u2018a modification of the theory is required such that \u2018empty space\u2019 takes the role of gravitating negative masses which are distributed all over the interstellar space.\u2019 (Einstein 1918).\u201d A result of Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity is that negative mass must travel at (infinitesimally) greater than the speed of light, and would have negative-imaginary rest mass. The only particles to be measured to travel at greater than the speed of light are the neutrinos. What is the easiest way to explain how a tachyon moves faster than the speed of light? The Lorentz transformation of Einstein\u2019s special theory explains it. You have to understand what the Lorentz factor does faster than the speed of light. For one thing, it is negative-imaginary and so must be the mass. The simplest explanation I have found is in the following cartoon:  And here is an August 8, 2018 press release by Robert Ehrlich, an Emeritus Physicist professor at George Mason University, on the subject: http://mason.gmu.edu/~rehrlich/t.... https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05155...: On July 13, 2018, it was announced that the IceCube-170922A neutrino arrived about \u201c10 days\u201c (actually 11 days) before electromagnetic signatures were received by telescopes from blazar TXS 0506+056, about 4 x 10^9 light-years distant. If they were initiated by the same rare event, as assumed, this is definitive proof that the neutrino traveled at infinitesimally greater than the speed of light. The neutrino, to arrive 11 days ahead, had to be going close to, v = (1 + 8.1 x 10^\u201312)c. This is confirmation of one of my predictions, in my thesis above. Also, neutrinos have the negative mass squared, that can only come from (negative)-imaginary rest mass: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2017/listings... \u2013 Page 6: MASS SQUARED (electron based) = \u2212 0.6 \u00b1 1.9 eV^2 OUR AVERAGE \u2013 12 negative, all larger or equal to \u2212 0.6, 2 positive but with the highest probable errors. New measurements on quasars extending back to closer than one billion years from the \u201cbig bang,\u201d indicate that dark energy is not a \u201ccosmological constant\u201d but has always been increasing: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/pape... There is a major problem with redshift energy. Clearly, redshifted photons have lost energy, but no one knew where that redshifted energy went. Dark energy is the major energy in our universe. It accelerates distant galaxies away and therefore, by the equivalence principle, is indistinguishable from negative gravity. Positive gravity has negative gravitational potential energy, and negative gravity has positive potential energy. Distant galaxies are falling down that dark energy positive potential energy gradient. Our universe is a gravitational dark energy potential energy field. The observed speed of light (from our reference frame), per Einstein\u2019s gravitational redshift formula, is: c(r) = [1+2 \u03c6(r)/ c^2] c, where c(r) is the variable non-local speed of light, r is the radial distance, \u03c6(r) is the variable potential energy difference, and c0 is the invariant local speed of light. Variation of the speed of light takes this out of the realm of special relativity, and into the realm of general relativity. Light photons from distant galaxies are traveling up that dark energy potential energy gradient, losing internal energy E(r) = hf (r), while gaining dark energy potential energy, \u03c6(r). What is the potential energy \u03c6(r)? To predict it we need a solution to the extended Einstein general relativity field equations, including a dark energy mass/energy-momentum tensor. Astronomers always previously assumed that the photon\u2019s wavelength \u03bb(r) changed (i.e., \u201cstretched\u201d), but not the speed of light c(r). The dilation of time by dark energy introduces profound changes to astronomy, cosmology, and the \u201cbig bang.\u201d Physics is beautiful and, once you get it right, everything fits together in perfect harmony.

            "answer_text": "Actually, there is almost no possibility that dark matter and dark energy do exist. There is certainly no empirical basis for the claim that they exist. All we have are the confident assurances of some reality challenged mathematicians, that their model of the universe requires the existence of dark matter and dark energy and therefore both must exist - despite the testimony of those lying eyes and instruments that refuse to detect them. The problem here is that the mathematical theorists who have created and curated the standard model of cosmology do not understand physics. Not only do they not understand physics, they actually believe that mathematics underlies reality, that math is in some way the determinant of physics. There is no sound evidence for this belief. Mathematics is a human invention comprised of abstract logical constructs based upon counting. It is a product of the human imagination and as such is unconstrained by the limitations imposed by physical reality. Pure mathematics occupies the same limitless realm as philosophy, theosophy, and science fiction. Mathematics, in other words, is not a science and the doing of math is not the doing of science. Mathematics is a useful tool of science when it is used to construct models of physical reality that are built strictly upon the physical reality that observation, measurement, and experimentation present to us. When the mathematical imagination is allowed to run amok however, it produces a model, like the current standard model, wherein the primary features and elements bear no resemblance to the reality we actually observe. So, we have dark matter, dark energy, space, time, black holes with their singularities, the inflation event, and the big bang itself. None of these things has ever been directly observed, nor will any of them likely ever be. They are products of the human mathematical imagination, no more physically substantial than the ghosts and goblins of bygone years. And yet, those are the defining features of the standard model. Now it is unraveling. The recent discovery that the distribution of matter in galaxies correlates with the observed rotation curves clearly demonstrates that it is the erroneous use of the Keplerian method in deriving the expected rotation curves of galaxies that is the source of the dark matter delusion. The \u201cmissing matter\u201d is only missing in the theoretical model, not in physical reality. Another recent study, of 740 supernovae, finds only\u201cmarginal\u201d support for the notion of the accelerating universal expansion that was originally inferred and grandiosely promulgated on the basis of a whopping 16 total supernovae observations. In other words the supposed acceleration effect is diminishing as the data set, though still small, increases. This is not at all surprising. Only the widespread mathematical hubris that currently infects the scientific academy could have elevated the original, skimpy data to a lofty claim of Universal Truth. Things fall apart, and the clunky, unscientific standard model of cosmology is long overdue for its trip to the junkyard of history. It couldn\u2019t happen to a more deserving example of mathematically based pseudo-science, and it can\u2019t happen soon enough. The discipline of physics needs to revert back to once again being the study of physical reality. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they all exist. They may not be as simple as the names suggest but something exists for each of them. Antimatter is simplest, we know exactly what it is, we can even make it. Dark matter and dark energy are less clear, there is certainly room for confusion, because people tend to think that these are just some form of matter and energy very like the normal types with just slight difference, and that isn't the intention of the names at all. Dark matter is called that because something is making visible matter behave in a certain way at the large scale (galactic and clusters of galaxies) and the way it makes matter behave is exactly as if there was a lot of extra matter there, but that we can't see, so \u201cdark matter\u201d doesn't actually mean \u201cnormal matter that isn't bright\u201d, it means \u201csomething, that acts just like matter but may not be, that doesn't seem to interact with light or anything else on the EM spectrum\u201d. That is unwieldy, so \u201cdark matter\u201d is a convenient placeholder until we know more. Likewise, at even larger scales (superclusters and up to the entire observable universe) there is something that seems to be a lot like energy, but doesn't interact with any other energy we know. So again dark energy is just a placeholder for whatever this may be. ",

            "answer_text": "The empirical evidence that supports the dark matter hypothesis is that galaxies rotate faster than their visible matter would predict. The basic idea is that dark matter adds gravitational attraction to galaxies, but does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, so we cannot detect it by usual means. The empirical evidence for dark energy is that the universe had an inflection point some billions of year ago, at which time the second derivative of the size of the universe changed from negative to positive. The basic idea is that the vacuum repels itself, and as the universe expands, it has more space (vacuum) and the same amount of matter. Therefore the attractive forces dominated early in the history of the universe, and the repulsive forces are now stronger, so the rate of expansion of the universe is increasing (and approaching exponential growth) and always will in the future. Dark energy is less \u201cmysterious\u201d because the \u201ccosmological constant\u201d in general relativity causes uniform expanding or contracting acceleration of the rate of expansion of the universe. It describes the observed increase in the rate of expansion of the universe reasonably well. At the level of classical physics, the solution has been sitting around since about 1917.

            "answer_text": "As suggested in a prior answer, dark matter could be explainable in terms of the effect of gravitational action acting upon the interstitial spatial stress between stars moving in the spiral arms of rotating galaxies -perhaps leading to some degree of co-rotational space. As for Dark Energy, there is, (as also previously discussed in other posts), a good argument for the proposition, that extra energy is not required to power exponential expansion (because positive and negative energy will be created in equal amounts in an exponentially expanding universe). Further embellishment upon the \u201cno need for dark energy idea,\u201d are presented herein-below: First a bit of history. As proposed by William McCrea circa 1950, expansion of a negative pressure volume creates positive energy. The form of the energy is not defined by McCrea\u2019s opus, however, British cosmologists, Fred Hoyle, and other supporters of \u201cSteady State Theory,\u201c saw an opportunity to interpret the idea as creating new particles. By this rationale, they justified their own theory that an expanding eternal universe would always look the same because new particles were supposedly created at the rate to fill the thinning density consequent of expansion. The concept of the steady state universe fell from grace with the discovery of CBR. This leaves the question as to what form newly created positive energy would take in an expanding negative pressure universe? Related thereto is the issue of whether McCrea\u2019s theory would be compatible with the emerging concept of a zero energy universe. For zero energy, space must be empty, or cosmic negative energy must be in balance with positive mc^2 energy. Since it is known the universe is not empty, only the latter scenario can be a reality. The present rate of cosmological acceleration is in the range of c^2/R where R is the Hubble scale. Thus, if the same mechanism has been at work since the universe was young and consequently \u2018r\u2019 were smaller, the expansion rate c^2/r would create greater spatial stress - perhaps sufficient to create particles. At some point, however, spatial stress diminishes to a level where the stress energy is insufficient to create new particles. How might the new energy be manifest? To satisfy the condition for zero energy and at the same time account for the stability of orbits, the MG product must be constant. The present level of expansion c^2/R simply increases negative gravitational energy and positive mc^2 energy equally. This nicely maintains energy at zero, while at the same time accounting for the fact that, as the mass-energy content of existing matter increases, so also does the inertial property of matter. That is why no new energy is needed. Reader\u2019s will find the critical equation (23) at page 14, here: REVISED THOUGHTS ON SPACE TIME AND GRAVITY.pdf When the density of matter (rho) is balanced by 3 times negative pressure (the zero energy condition for the universe universe) there is only one possible solution of the gravitational equations (23 and 24). These are the equations extracted from General Relativity.* The exponentially expanding universe provides its own positive energy at the same rate it creates negative energy.** That the inertia of matter increases with expansion is not only a validation of McCrea\u2019s Principle, it is the logical result of an increasing negative energy field (which in some way is displaced when matter is accelerated). The greater the extent of the negative energy if a gravitational field, the greater the inertia of the mass which defines the quantity of negative energy associated therewith. *Specifically, for rho(c^2) = - 3P, all the terms in (23) disappear except for the cosmological constant. Then R is proportional to e^Ht **\u201dIt costs nothing to create a mass at the center of the universe\u201d\u2026..Richard Feynman, Lectures on Gravity. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s what I found. Unseen dark matter has been invoked several times to solve problems in astrophysics and cosmology. Historically the most significant problem has been the rotation curves of galaxies, particularly spiral galaxies. Using the Doppler Effect the speeds of the stars and gases in the disk regions of spiral galaxies can be measured. See Figure 1. By now hundreds of thousands of galaxies have been measured this way. What is observed is that the speeds of the stars, and the gases beyond where the stars are observed, are much greater than it would appear Newtonian physics allows for. As a result it has been suggested that there is an invisible halo of cold non-interacting matter. This putative invisible halo has the needed gravitational effect on the stars and gases but it cannot be seen, hence it is called dark matter. Dark matter is alleged not to be normal atomic matter, made from protons and neutrons (which are known as baryons), but some sort of slowly moving (cold) exotic non-baryonic matter. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) were suggested. And until recently it was believed that WIMPs might be the lowest mass stable supersymmetric particle, called a neutralino, but 10 years of experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has disproven the theory upon which such a speculation was based. Other laboratory investigations with supersensitive detectors, deep underground, have failed to detect any type of particle that could be considered a candidate for dark matter. On the cosmological scale Considerations for a sizable content of dark matter have been also discussed in a cosmological context. The need for these have come about because of various problems with the standard model. When we put this all together we can generally say that dark matter (and other dark sector entities) are really only needed in astrophysics and cosmology. When we put this all together we can generally say that dark matter (and other dark sector entities) are really only needed in astrophysics and cosmology. But the lack of detection of any type of dark matter in laboratory experiments has driven some to speculate and develop new physical theories to explain what we observe astronomically. And there are two cosmological reasons why cosmologists need non-baryonic (non-normal atomic) cold dark matter (CDM). One is that the measured density of the gravitating mass in the universe as determined by astronomical measurements appears to considerably exceed that of normal matter as constrained by big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). BBN does present other problems but we won\u2019t go into them here. The amount of matter needed in the universe is six times the observed amount of baryonic (normal atomic) matter. Therefore it is believed that the density of particles that don\u2019t comprise normal atomic matter, i.e. the non-baryonic matter, is about five times the amount of the baryonic matter. Dark matter in the form of black holes, supermassive or otherwise, has implications for BBN. If dark matter was real and, as now suggested, comprised of stellar size black holes (i.e. non-baryonic matter) in the early universe, then the black holes would have had to have formed in the first minute after the beginning of the universe. Otherwise the black holes would have had an observable effect on BBN. The details of this are now also being debated and recalculations being made. A second cosmological reason is that gravity itself is too weak to grow, on the available cosmic timescales, the presently observed structures (e.g., galaxies, clusters, superclusters and long galactic filaments) from the alleged smooth initial condition observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), unless something was available to accelerate the growth process. Additional matter with a density much higher than the observed matter density could have done it. But if it was normal atomic matter, i.e. baryons, it would be observable and would have shown up in the observations of the CMB radiation. Therefore this new non-baryonic matter must not interact with the photons of the CMB like ordinary atomic matter allegedly does. Another look at rotation curves When we measure the speed of planets in the solar system, the measurement of a planet\u2019s constant speed (v) in orbit around the sun and its distance from the sun (r) allows us to determine the mass of the sun (M ). Considering only the sun and an orbiting planet this is a two-body problem and all that is needed is Newton\u2019s equation for this two-body problem to solve for the mass of the sun. The only unknown is M , the mass of the sun. With near circular orbits (a planet\u2019s acceleration around the sun is very close to zero, i.e. r\u2032\u2032\u22480). It follows that  where G is Newton\u2019s gravitational constant. Similarly, we can write down an almost identical equation for the enclosed mass, M(r), within the orbit of any star at a distance r from the centre of a galaxy.  In this case M(r) gives you the mass enclosed inside the orbit of the star you are measuring. It is not constant but depends on the distance r the star (or circulating gas) is from the centre of the galaxy under investigation. But this is where the assumption of dark matter comes from.  Figure 2. Typical rotation curve (red dashed, labelled Observed) for a spiral galaxy. The solid blue curve, labelled Newtonian, is what is expected from an application of Eq. (2) to the visible matter distributed through a galaxy. If we plot the speed of the stars, v (and the same for gases outside the radius of visible stars), as a function of distance, r, from the centre of a galaxy we typically get the result shown in Figure 2. But as can be seen, stars (and gases) move \u201ctoo fast\u201d when they are outside the central nucleus of the galaxy (indicated by the hump in the Newtonian curve). The observed speeds are much faster than what is expected from standard Newtonian physics. The observed speeds are much faster than what is expected from standard Newtonian physics. But Newtonian physics works very well in the solar system. The more distant a planet is from the sun the slower it moves. Why then doesn\u2019t the same physics work for galaxies? From this result shown in Figure 2 and known Newtonian physics it is usually concluded that one of the following must be true: The galaxy is dissipating, orNewtonian physics is incorrect, orMassive amounts of unobserved halo dark matter exist.On bullet point 1, the implication is that the galaxy under observation is not in equilibrium, which possibly could be argued because we have not observed galaxies over millions of years to see any structural evolution. But let us assume here (as is generally assumed) that all observations are consistent with stable equilibrium conditions. In fact Eq. (2), which is the basis of the problem, implicitly assumes an equilibrium condition. On bullet point 2, since under weak gravity, which is the case in most regions of a galaxy, apart from maybe inside or near a supermassive black hole at the core of the galaxy under consideration, Einstein\u2019s general relativity theory produces the same equations of motion as Newton\u2019s law of gravitation. Therefore, for circular motion of bodies in orbit we only need consider Newtonian physics. Science  Figure 3. Artist\u2019s illustration of a binary stellar size black hole merger detected by LIGO in 2016. On bullet point 3, it is obligatory on those who profess to believe the existence of some unseen exotic type of matter that does not respond to or is not detectable by electromagnetic radiation to produce evidence of the existence of even one such particle in a laboratory experiment, especially considering that they require the matter of this galaxy to be about 85% dark matter. This is the typical percentage of additional unseen matter if one were to accept the answer is dark matter in the form of a spherical halo around not only our galaxy but also most spiral galaxies of which we are aware. [If] known physics \u2026 was not properly modelled, then this might just solve the problem of the rotation curves without the need to \u201cinvent\u201d exotic dark matter. However, due to the lack of any laboratory evidence in favour of the existence of any new particles that might comprise halo dark matter in hundreds of thousands of galaxies, it has now been suggested that dark matter could be comprised of millions, even billions, of stellar-size black holes. See Figure 3. This suggestion has come about after the detection of stellar-size black holes by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors. The notion that stellar mass (10 to 100 times the mass of the sun) black holes could be dark matter in halos of galaxies is currently being debated. In the 1990s microlensing all but ruled out the possibility of swarms of such black holes but now it is said that the surveys were too short and longer surveys are needed. It is also argued that black holes in excess of 10 solar masses would have long ago settled in the centres of galaxies and any in the regions surrounding galaxies would leave the galaxies ruffled up, but observations indicate the opposite\u2014compact and unruffled. Stars have drag It could be said that there is one aspect that needs to be added to bullet point 2. It may not be new physics that is needed but the correct application of the known physics. If an incorrect boundary condition was assumed or an incomplete application was made of the known physics where one aspect was not properly modelled, then this might just solve the problem of the rotation curves without the need to \u201cinvent\u201d exotic dark matter. This is what has now been proposed. The application of Eq. (2) as described above neglects the billion-body problem and therefore neglects drag between the individual members of the system. Donald Saari, a mathematician who has worked on this problem, writes in the online Scientific American SciAm News, that the \u2026 general properties of billion-body Newtonian systems are unknown, so astronomers developed creative approximations to study galactic systems. Intuition for a standard approach comes from star-soup type pictures of galaxies, with bodies pulling others along (as in Figure 1). This star-soup appearance suggests approximating actual N-body systems with a continuum \u2026 And that continuum approximation results in Eq. (2), which then leads to the dark matter conundrum. The illustration often used in reference to Einstein\u2019s general relativity theory (and remember Newtonian physics can be derived from GR) is that \u201cmasses tell space how to curve and the curved space tells the masses how to move\u201d. This in effect assumes the masses in a galaxy are a continuum and thus curve the space in the galaxy in a smooth fashion. The individual stars are neglected in favour of a smooth continuum of matter density. And in the modelling the matter density is modelled in this fashion. But by approximating the billion-body system of a galaxy as a continuum of smoothed-out matter it appears that something is neglected in the application of the standard Newtonian physics. Saari did the billion-body system calculations and found that\u2026 a star\u2019s Newtonian rotational velocity is the M(r) gravitational effect plus dragging terms; these larger v values exaggerate M(r) values of [Eq.] (2). As dragging is more pronounced at larger distances, expect this error to incorrectly predict halos. \u2026. No solution has halos, yet [Eq.] (2) incorrectly predicts massive ones! These egregious errors manifest differences between systems of discrete bodies and approximations; actual systems involve dragging effects, while continuum approximations ignore this crucial dynamic. (emphases added) Conclusion Saari ends the online SciAm News article with his own conclusion. \u201cThis casts doubt about a standard argument claiming massive amounts of dark matter.\u201d There you have it! I have not personally checked his maths but his work is published in good journals including The Astronomical Journal. I have also published in that journal and I know it takes some effort to get published there. The relevance for biblical creationists is just as important as it is for cosmic evolutionists. The problem of galaxy rotation curves has been an issue for a very long time and no matter to which cosmogony you subscribe, you still have to explain how galaxies hold together over billions of years if the standard application of Newtonian physics is correct. Of course, a biblical creationist might argue that the galaxies are not in equilibrium, because the universe is not billions of years old. That is a possibility but one I believe not very likely. It is more likely that God created all galaxies in a stable configuration, just as he did the sun and the solar system, and all other systems in the galaxy. Those stable systems exhibit operational physics, which, in principle, we can investigate. Now it seems we can add one more thing, the operational physics of galaxies is standard Newtonian when all factors are correctly included. For the big bang cosmologist this is a big problem. Up to this point the 80% of all galaxy matter being dark matter is consistent with what they need in big bang cosmology. Without this five times the amount of non-baryonic matter to baryonic matter in the universe the standard big bang cosmology does not agree with the cosmological observations, such as from high-redshift-supernova measurements and even the fluctuations in CMB radiation. In my opinion, it was brave for Scientific American to publish Saari\u2019s news item. Let\u2019s see if his work gains any traction. If this pans out, for me it is a relief. We can continue to use standard physics in the cosmos and no longer need to look for alternative theories to explain what we could not up until now. ",

In the meantime, I want to point out out that words like \u2018dark\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019 are always used by theorists when dealing with unknowns. Before Pluto was discovered, it was theorized that a bigger planet was there. They called it planet X because x is a variable for an unknown quantity. Now there are theorized unknown forces we don\u2019t understand, and we call them dark for the same reason the middle ages are sometimes called dark: a lack of knowledge. Writing was all but lost in the middle ages, so historically they are a dark period. Here observations don\u2019t match with current understanding, so an unknown influence is believed to be responsible. We are in the dark, however, and freely admit it. Science is often thought of as something that is beyond us. Quantum physics in particular. But the subatomic world affects us constantly in the form of electricity, which is made of electrons, which, of course, are atomic particles. As has been said here, the antimatter version of the electron is the positron. On Star Trek, the android Data has a positronic brain. The word was used more because it sounded cool than for any real association with science, but have you heard of PET scans? Positron emission tomography - Wikipedia I\u2019m genuinely surprised that none of the answers here have mentioned it. It\u2019s the reason hospitals have nuclear medicine departments. We actually use real antimatter to make diagnoses now. So not only does antimatter exist, but its real world application may one day save the life of you or someone you love. How cool is that?  ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know if anyone will find this of interest, but as a result of a massive metaphysical phenomenon that occurred about the end of August/1st week of September 2001 as a result of extreme circumstances, that which I discovered is my (and everyones) \u201cenergetic consciousness-awareness egoic identity entity\u201d (generally and vaguely referred to as one\u2019s \u201csoul\u201d or \u201cspirit\u201d), which is what each of us actually is embedded/trapped in a meat suit playing the game of life on Earth, literally rapidly expanded and continued to expand in a spherical manner such that I was aware of everything in every direction simultaneously, because what can be likened unto perceptual filters in our brain that prevent us from remembering, knowing and comprehending what we actually already know when we aren\u2019t trapped in our bio-body these \u201cfilters\u201d drop/dematerialize and one then connects, or rather is able to perceive the always existing connection, with what might be described as the Supreme Divine Source Mind of all Power and Creation, and although one does not see with physical eyes, one \u201csees\u201d with inner energetic \u201csensory\u201d eyes and recognizes the fundamental nature of the energy behind the building blocks of all that exists. It is from and within this static yet dynamic energy (that\u2019s a whole discussion in itself), which is comprehensively flexible and takes whatever form is appropriate for its purpose and function (any combination of subatomic particles, waves, strings, etc.) that all that is created and exists physical manifests. It is beyond human comprehension, but when relieved of one\u2019s perceptual filters one is able to recognize it, feel it, know it and \u201csee\u201d it through this extra sensory perception that our true selves, the \u201cenergetic identity entities\u201d, have without those filters. My best description for the nature of this intelligent energy, something for which there really are no words to describe it, was/is \u201cdivine web-matrix\u201d. I am not an artist but I attempted to illustrate what I perceived, but it required sophisticated 3-D rendering so was an embarrassing disaster. Then some years later I saw a mathematical rendering of what I believe was called Dark Matter and got the chills because this is EXACTLY what the fundamental Source energy \u201clooks\u201d like, except it is dynamic, like vibrating & shifting static-lightening electricity-like energy, within which everything that is physical is couched. It, the fundamental energy, is beyond time & space. That which is created within it allows for and creates time and space. It is composed of pure intelligent consciousness-awareness energy and as long as science attempts to describe it as one of what are its numerous manifestations, science will see only a derivative and identify only one part of the elephant. It\u2019s really just so amazing, astounding, brilliant, ingenious and mind boggling. But there\u2019s no better feeling than actually having a fundamental, conceptual understanding of what is behind the All of intelligent creation and which the most intelligent of our species seeks to discover. :) ",

            "answer_text": "All the research that has been done so far about the space and the various phenomena associated with it has been full of voids and blanks.There are many aspects that the scientists do not understand. DARK MATTER , DARK ENERGY , ANTI-MATTER are some of the theories that have been devised by the scientists to fill the missing places . All of these are theoretical concepts that were required to explain some strange phenomena. Dark matter : When scientists were observing distant galaxies and making observations of the rotation speed , amount of matter in the galaxy , its ingredients , they found an ambiguity. They found that the rotation speed of the galaxies did not correspond to the amount of matter in the galaxy. According to their observation and calculations the galaxies were spinning way fast than they should have been. And this was not the case with only one galaxy. Observations were made on multiple galaxies .But the scientists could not reach to a conclusion that could explain this abnormality . So they concluded that this was caused by a form of matter that was invisible (that is it did not interact with light) and named it DARK MATTER in order to fill in for the absent mass. DARK ENERGY : Scientists had a hypothesis that after the big bang there will be a time when the gravity between the galaxies , stars and planets will over come the outward splash of the big bang and everything will start to fall back due to the gravity.When this theory was being tested by measuring the Doppler Shift of distant galaxies by Hubble telescope , scientists were astonished when they saw that the light coming from the distant galaxies was red shifted (this signifies object moving away) rather than being blue shifted. This thing was completely different from the predictions and in order to explain this the concept of DARK ENERGY was devised .This energy was something that was not only fighting the gravity from letting the things from collapsing but also winning the battle quiet easily because the galaxies were observed to be accelerating more and more with each second. ANTI MATTER : Anti matter particles have been in the list of theories from quiet some time now .They are one of the explanation of the big bang . You can imagine anti matter particle as something having properties completely opposite to normal matter.For example regular Hydrogen has proton in the nucleus and an electron in its orbit , an Anti Hydrogen has an electron in the nucleus and a proton in the orbit. So whenever a matter anti-matter pair meet they annihilate themselves. Scientists believe that the reverse was the case during the Big Bang. Out of no ware matter and anti matter came into existence and due to the power of explosion during the Big Bang the anti matter part was thrown out where as the matter part remained.The same concept is used to describe the HAWKING RADIATION at the event horizon. Thus , all of these things may exist or may not exist but till now we haven\u2019t found any proof of even one of them in the space. We think that they might be the explanation to our problems . But they might not be as well. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem is that neither dark matter or dark energy can be directly observed, at least not yet. Their existence is implied by their influence on things we can observe. What the two appear to have in common is gravitation; astronomical observations strongly suggest that dark matter exhibits positive gravitation or attraction while dark energy produces negative gravitation or repulsion. From the perspective of general relativity this means negative and positive space time curvature respectively. The distribution of dark matter can be inferred by observing apparent non Newtonian motion within and between galaxies and these measurements suggest that dark matter is not uniformly distributed but is present in clumps. The question \u201cclumps of what?\u201d remains to be answered. Analysis of this influence on observable objects suggests that dark matter comprises somewhere between 80 and 90 percent of the mass of the universe. So either our Newtonian and Einsteinian theories are terribly wrong on a cosmological scale or there are forces in play that remain to be identified. When it comes to dark energy the scale becomes even larger. Observations of very distant objects are, because of the limitations imposed by the speed of light, observations of the distant past. Using our current understanding of things like relativistic red shift the data indicates that not only is the cosmos expanding, as discovered by Hubble, but the rate of expansion is increasing over time rather than decreasing. There is no known way for this to happen if gravitation is the only force involved. Thus enters \u201cdark energy\u201d and Einstein\u2019s Cosmological Constant. It has been suggested that \u201cquantum foam\u201d or \u201czero point energy\u201d plays a roll in at least one and possibly both of these phenomenon and attempts to invoke quantum field theory and string theory have been thrown into the mix but nothing testable has emerged. There is a conjecture (mine) that the quantum foam particles predicted by the Heisenberg uncertainty principal is involved. But instead of these transitory particle pairs that spring into existence and and then self annihilate consisting of matter and antimatter they consist of particles of positive and negative mass. There are a couple of reasons to suspect this. While measurement of the mass of antimatter are difficult to make it appears that both matter and anti matter have positive mass and this is consistent with other parts of quantum theory. This being the case the constant \u201cfizz\u201d of positive mass particles would be expected to have gravitational properties that would produce significant cosmological consequences. This has not been observed. It should also be pointed that a slight anisotropy in the annihilation could result in a non zero lambda. This \u201cconjecture\u201d can carry us in many directions. For example the suggestion that particles of negative mass may exist in nature would have profound consequences if they can be observed and better yet manipulated. One I particularly like is the potential for using this as part of the realization of a functional Alcuberrie warp drive without resorting to an impossibly large amount of energy . For example, if positive and negative mass particles could be separated before they self annihilate and then concentrated in front of and behind a spacecraft you get a picture that is remarkably similar to the metric described by Alcuberrie.

            "answer_text": "Dark Energy and Dark Matter are wholly theoretical so, no, they don\u2019t exist as far as science knows. However, Scientists, who are generally so careful in naming things, have really gone off the deep end with Dark Energy and Dark Matter. They are neither \u201cdark\u201d nor are they \u201cenergy\u201d or \u201cmatter.\u201d If they were energy, we could detect them, like light which we can see Billions of light-years away. If it were \u201cmatter\u201d then why doesn\u2019t it have any mass? Anti-matter, on the other hand, definitely exists since it has been created at CERN. However, no anti-matter exists in this universe. This has interesting ramifications regarding the Big Bang. Both particles and anti-particles were created in the Big Bang. Had there been an equal number of each, however, there would be no matter in the Universe. This is one of the incredibly profound and puzzling aspects of the Big Bang. Why would this happen? If the BB were a complete accident\u2014which it could not be--since nothing explains the creation of matter and energy from nothing, and nothing can explain how an infinite singularity, having infinite gravity, and being infinitely small could explode, certainly not rationally, the Universe should not exist. We understand the Universe only insofar as it follows rational laws. (Since the existence of matter and energy cannot come from nothing, and infinite gravity could not explode, these facts imply another answer. I have written about this issue in response to a number of questions regarding the BB and proposed a rational explanation for these impossibilities.) Another problem is how could all of the mass in the Universe, 1.5. x 10/53/kg., which would have caused a black hole having infinite gravity and would have been infinitely small, explode? It could not according to reason. Something outside nature\u2014and greater than infinite\u2014had to do it. Getting back to anti-matter, in order for there to be a Universe now, there had to be more matter created than anti-matter. Can this, too, be an accident\u2014something incomprehensible to reason, even illogical? Logically, there should have been equal amounts. Something caused the imbalance. Rationally, there is nothing that could have caused this unless we are truly going to accept that the Universe follows no laws, nor can it be understood, which is another way of saying \u201caccident.\u201d Since every particle has an anti-particle, all of the anti-matter in the Universe was destroyed when it hit matter. The amount of matter in the Universe which I mentioned above, is enormous, beyond comprehension. And, yet, this same incomprehensibly large amount of matter is just that slight excess of matter over anti-matter from the BB. That is also why there is no anti-matter in the Universe, because before nucleosynthesis\u2014when matter could form into a nucleus and atoms\u2014almost all of which was Hydrogen and Deuterium (at about 3000degrees Kelvin)\u2014and photons could escape from the \u201cprimordial soup\u201d\u2014called that because it was not only unimaginably hot\u2014hotter than a Billion Galaxies of 100,000,000 stars each\u2014but it was so small that photons, protons, neutrons, and electrons kept hitting other so that atoms could not form and photons couldn\u2019t escape. At approximately 3000 deg. K, however, came the moment of \u201ccombination\u201d (wrongly called \u201cre\u201d-combination since nothing had combined into atoms before that moment), and light could escape from the gravity and particle bashing. This was the first \u201ctime\u201d in history when the Universe emitted light\u2014some 200,000 to 350,000 thousand years after the BB. (Obviously, I am not referring to the 23 hr. 56 min. and 11 sec. day by which we mark our lives. I am referring instead to the vibrations of a cesium atom.) I hope this answers your question and gave you a little more information about the nature of the Universe and anti-particles, or antimatter. ",

Anything that rotates rotates in two opposite directions at the same time.  What is antimatter? \u2026 a mirror image of matter. \u2026 This bicycle wheel is a mirror image of the other side of the wheel. The jets from a quasar could very well spew out matter on one side and antimatter on the other. Traveling close to the speed of light, by this time, they are a long way from each other and still traveling. So in my understanding, the majority of matter and antimatter were produced by quasars and not by stars. The James Webb will have the answer next year if everything goes accordingly.

All particles are known to have anti-particles. An anti-hydrogen atom has been made from a positron and an anti-proton.

            "answer_text": "SYMMETRY, MATTER PROPAGATION AND INTERACTIONS Nature is endowed with a peculiar characteristic, which is symmetry. It appears that everything has a symmetrical counterpart. Mathematically, symmetry occurs in different forms as may be defined by a rectangular space coordinate system. Polar symmetry occurs when at least three attributes are opposite through the origin. Examples of this are: (x,y,z) is the symmetrical counterpart of (-x,-y, -z) (x,-y,z) is the symmetrical counterpart of (-x,y,-z) (-x,-y,z) is the symmetrical counterpart of (x,y,-z) (x,-y,-z) is the symmetrical counterpart of (-x,y,z) Planar symmetry occurs when at least two attribute are opposite thus the symmetrical objects are in opposite quadrants. Examples of this are: (x,y) is the symmetrical counterpart of (-x,-y) (-x,y) is the symmetrical counterpart of (x,-y) Linear symmetry or simple symmetry occurs when at least one attribute are opposite. Examples of these are: (x,y) is the symmetrical counterpart of (-x,y) (x,y) is the symmetrical counterpart of (x,-y) (-x,y) is the symmetrical counterpart of (-x,-y) (x,-y) is the symmetrical counterpart of (-x,-y) If we adopt Creation as the beginning of everything, the creation from nothing event would have been as defined by the Bible. Thus when the command \u201cLet there be light\u201d was given (which is the exciter or cause) two things were produced from nothing; Light and Darkness. This pair production may be represented by the equation of ZERO which is; 0 = (+1) + (-1) (+1) here represents Light and (-1) represents darkness. The operator + represents the command. Light has attributes. It has energy, velocity and direction. Darkness should therefore also possess these attributes but opposite that of Light. Darkness therefore is dark energy. What could happen then if Light collides with Darkness? The apparent possibility is that Light and Darkness may cancel each other. But if they must cancel each other then the command that created them must have to be released. A command however is a command, and once it is given, it cannot be undone. You cannot swallow back the words that you have already uttered. So the annihilation of Darkness and Light may not be possible. The possible reaction therefore would be a secondary creation process. When Light, which is basically energy, collides with darkness which is also energy, a new entity is created; ZPE which is Light Matrix or Energy Matrix. Here there is no need for a symmetrical counterpart of ZPE, it being energy at its lowest possible density. ZPE therefore is its own symmetrical counterpart. ZPE is also a form of virtual of mass. Matter and Energy however can also interact. When sufficient Light energy is imparted to the Light Matrix, the Light energy is transformed into two particles; matter and anti- matter. The same thing happens to Dark energy on the Light Matrix. Each pair of two new particles have identical metrical structures but differ in one attribute which is charge; one positively and one negatively charge. Each of particles is therefore linearly symmetrical opposite. Light generates MATTER and ANTIMATTER. Dark energy generates DARK MATTER and DARK ANTIMATTER. When symmetrically opposite particles collide, they annihilate each other and revert back to the type of energy that they originated from. (See Fig. I, Fig. IIA, and Fig. IIB, for the diagrams of matter propagation and interactions). Matter and Dark Matter can also interact. When they collide, they will release the energy that created them while there masses cancel out; Light Energy and Dark Energy. The same reaction can be expected when Anti- matter and Dark anti-matter collide. There are two other possible reactions; the collision of Matter and Dark anti-matter, and the collision of Anti-matter and Dark matter. What could possibly happen here, we can only speculate. These may not result in annihilation. The said particle pairings are not necessarily symmetrical opposites; hence the reactions are most likely mass fragmentation or possible assimilation, the later resulting in the growth of mass. ",

How they move(waves), how that is demonstrated by slit interfere patterns, etc.. The book moved on to the point of the chapter\u2026 The scientists of the time had a problem with tbe motion of the photon. In order to move in a wave, the photons MUST be traveling through a medium. The book laid all the facts out(as they knew them) as proof. The existence of this medium, Undetectable by instruments but thru which photons traveled, was an accepted fact. I have a suspicion that, in 50 or so years, there will be a collective \u201cD'oh\u201d moment\u2026 and Dark Matter will be laid to rest next to it's older brother\u2026 the Aether. ",

Instead, gamma-rays are produced in which positrons and electrons cancel, producing positive and negative semi-photons (\u2018semi\u2019 being one-half). Then these, stripped of their charges, continue to cancel each other out with +/- 1 spins. Since a Danish physicist has solved several mathematical problems concerning gravitinos (his term), perhaps they are Dark matter, with Spacetime being made up of positive and negative gravitrinos (my term). I suggest gravitrons to make up Black Holes (gravitron stars?) ; gravitons to be gravity\u2019s photons (now proven; from Einstein); and gravitrinos to make up Dark matter. Let\u2019s suppose every lepton has a gravitrino. Then opposed leptons would mutually cancel, producing also opposed gravitrinos). Neutrinos would also have gravitrinos (neutrinos and anti-neutrinos mutually cancel). But electrons would have anti-gravitrinos while positrons have gravitrinos. Because sub-particles produce more anti-neutrinos than neutrinos (54% to 46%), this charge-spin inequality might exist because of gravitrino unsymmetry (which parallels that of neutrinos to anti-neutrinos). Which then would be why anti-matter exists only in laboratories. The universe is actually a multi-verse with many cluster universes. If gravity is an unequal magnetically polarized force, then similarly \u2018charged\u2019 fields may be pushing each other away while others would be pulled into superclusters because magnetically opposed.

So, if matter exists then it must be paid for by anti-matter. But then the two would annihilate one another and our universe and its anti-universe partner would not exists. Therefore there must be a slight amount of asymmetry for the 2 universes to go their separate ways. And this evident by the fact that the anti-universe (Dark Matter/Dark Energy) represents 95% of all known substance in the surrounding Cosmos. And this could mean that this unusual matter/energy is evolving at a slower rate than our usual matter/energy.

A modified theory of the strength of gravity can explain anomalous Galaxy rotation curves, but has a lot of trouble explaining something like the Bullet Cluster. In the case of the Bullet Cluster the center of mass calculated from gravitational lensing is far from the center of mass calculated via visible matter. It really does look like there's some invisible 'stuff' around the galaxy that is independent from and not in the same location as the visible matter. ",

Conversely to what other say, that our own gravity keeps our visible cosmos from flying apart, it is the gravity from the surrounding unseen cosmos that keeps our visible cosmos from attracting inward on itself. We are in a counter balanced overall cosmos that has been estimated to be trillions of billions larger than we measure our own bubble to be. Anti matter in the unseen universe would have the same effect there as it does here. Basically nada\u2026. IMHO ",
