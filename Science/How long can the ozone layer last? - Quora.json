            "answer_text": "Short answer: indefinitely. The ozone in the atmosphere is continually produced by the interaction of UV sunlight with the oxygen in the atmosphere, primarily by breaking up O2 (molecular oxygen) into two O molecules (atomic oxygen). The individual O atoms can then combine with O2 molecules to produce O3 (ozone). There are many chemical reactions involved which effect the O3 concentrations by either creating or destroying ozone directly or by altering the concentrations of the other constituents in those reactions. The O3 concentration is a result of the chemical balance between all those reactions and the rate at which sunlight disturbs and splits apart molecules. The reason chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were/are a concern is because they drastically altered the chemistry. The balancing concentration of O3 between all the different reactions in the presence of CFCs, which catalytically destroy ozone, was much lower than the balancing concentration with only the naturally occuring chemicals. As long as the sun keeps producing roughly the same spectrum of light and the chemical makeup of our atmosphere stays similar, the ozone layer will persist indefinitely. ",

            "answer_text": "Under natural conditions, it will last as long as the Earth has an atmosphere. It is constantly renewed as UV light breaks down oxygen molecules (O2) into separate oxygen atoms (O) which combine with O2 to form O3 (Ozone\u2013oxygen cycle - Wikipedia). The main problem is when humans add a chemical like chlorofluorocarbons to the atmosphere that breaks down the ozone faster than it can regenerate, causing levels to drop. It is also possible that global warming will cause the oceans to start releasing hydrogen sulfide, which also destroys the ozone layer (Global Warming Led To Atmospheric Hydrogen Sulfide And Permian Extinction).
