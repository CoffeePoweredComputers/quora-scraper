            "answer_text": "If we put aside the very strong fossil fuel industry lobby\u2026 (1) Inadequate infrastructure. U.S. power plants were designed back when coal, oil, and natural gas were the only choices. This includes power plants that have come online in the past decade (We\u2019re not even building nuclear power plants as we once did). Centralized power-producing plants are not the appropriate model for renewable energy sources, which means that it\u2019s not just power plants that are out of date. Energy producers are also energy distributors. It\u2019s likely that their business will eventually be in acquisition and distribution of power from renewable sources. But this is quite a way off for some regions of the U.S. and less so for behemoths like California. When considering motorized transportation, infrastructure is still lagging significantly. Most regions do not have charging stations at adequate intervals for electric vehicles. However, railways are in the process of becoming electrified. For commuter lines, this means faster transit times and more frequent trains\u2014 perhaps, enticing motorists to get out of their cars for some transportation needs. (2) Not-quite-there renewable energy technology. While the technologies for renewable energy have made tremendous strides in the past decade, they still have two problems (that will go away rather soon\u2014 maybe another decade): (a) They are mostly a little above the price point that many consumers are willing to pay. (b) They do not produce a steady flow of energy. The first will resolve itself as the technology gets cheaper to build, use, and maintain. The second will resolve itself as massive energy storage (e.g., \u201cbatteries\u201d) gains the capacity to store energy from solar and wind sources and push it through the infrastructure in a metered way. Elon Musk (of Tesla fame) is dedicating substantial resources to R&D for better energy storage. Volvo has committed to having all its models run with an electric power chain by 2019\u20132021. Both of these issues are being addressed with a demand-side economic push. They can also be addressed with federal and state environmental protections. Energy-related businesses manage to find the talent to make the breakthroughs when there\u2019s unmet demand and/or an imperative to improve. As of 2017, we\u2019re seeing a feverish national effort to reverse environmental protections and to defund R&D for renewable energy technology. Major corporations have said that they still intend to move toward renewable energy sources and to reduce overall energy consumption. It\u2019s their future and they want to be prepared. CEOs from some of these corporations intend to fulfill the Paris Agreement commitments that the U.S. has made\u2014 with or without White House concurrence. In fact, there are major energy-producing corporations that have been outspoken in their opposition to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. As of yesterday, the POTUS reiterated what he\u2019s been saying for a long time: Maybe he\u2019ll work something out regarding the U.S. withdrawal; maybe he won\u2019t. His position has been that the Agreement is \u201cunfair\u201d to the U.S. However, most of the list of grievances he\u2019s stated are not true. It\u2019s possible that he\u2019s based his assumptions on the comments of alt-right talk show hosts; sometimes what he says is a direct (uncited) quote. It\u2019s pretty obvious that he has not read the substance of the Agreement or the \u201cexecutive summary.\u201d With Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA (a federal agency that he sued 13 times), it will be a complicated dance before the US would withdraw its withdrawal from the Agreement. Meanwhile, we continue to use fossil fuels because we do not have adequate production and distribution of renewable energy. ",

            "answer_text": "We consider the government and fossil fuel companies are evil and force us to use fossil fuels. Those mean old \u201cother people\u201d of the world are destroying our planet. We are all dependent on fossil fuel. We are perfectly addicted to them. How does a drug addict defend himself against his desire not to inject drugs as he shakes violently holding a full syringe while trying to stab a vein in his arm? How long would it be before you called the power company after losing electrical service? Standing in a grocery store with no food, just bare shelves could you calmly leave without complaint or worry? When you went to buy tires, what if none were available to be sold? There is energy past, energy present and energy future. It would be nice to think that we could learn to live on energy present and future; but, we are addicted to things which require energy past. We are indeed a gluttonous lot. We are addicted to fossil fuels. We want and need those DIRTY hydrocarbons, we support their use every time we buy tires, use plastic, buy clothes, take a drive for no good reason, fly to visit grandmaw and just about anything we do. We will phase out fossil fuels when the last drop of oil is pumped out of the earth and the last person dies scratching in the dirt to find the last nugget of coal. You could not ask this question without the computer, the chair you are setting in and the food you ate for breakfast\u2026 all of which come from fossil fuels. We will stop using fossil fuels when the fires of the underworld freeze over, and they say the Devil is predicting climate change which will cause the temperature of the underworld to increase and flood with molten lava\u2026 which should concern politicians promoting alternative energy without knowing anything about engineering or science. The use of oil and fossil fuels is not just for fuel, you cannot pave the roads with electricity from solar or wind. Electric cars are made from fossil fuels and always will be. Solar energy is only made possible from lots of coke and other fossil fuels for their manufacture and to provide energy when the sun goes behind clouds. The fossil fuel industry is not dead! It is not even threatened by the minuscule growth in the trendy foolishness of the wind and solar industry. The fossil fuel industry benefits from every solar cell and wind generator that is built and they know they will never supplant fossil fuel use, wind and solar very well may increase our use of fossil fuels. Do you know of a source of energy which will provide 154,000 TWh of energy and raw material?  Energy Production & Changing Energy Sources We keep using more fossil fuels every year, not less. Even if we doubled and tripled wind and solar, it still would only make a small dent in the total energy.   The above pie chart is for the U.S. in 2018. Wind and solar make up 30% of the 11% of what is considered renewable. That means wind makes up 2.5% and solar 0.66% of the total. ",
