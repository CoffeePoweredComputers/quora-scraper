            "answer_text": "If you are talking about condenser in thermal power plant then the answer is no. there is a limit to how much vacuum the condenser needs for the whole operation to work as close to designed operating conditions. If the pressure in the condenser is too low then the condensate in the hot well will have a sub cooling effect which means the condenser will do a bit of extra cooling and the temperatures and pressures required for further processes will be disturbed. The LP heater, HP heater and other boiler accessories afterwards will have to do more heating apparently. ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps you are talking about the condenser in a refrigeration system?It does not contain a vacuum, but high pressure refrigerant gas when the system is running. It is the evaporator side that has low pressure (not a vacuum. If there indeed is a vacuum there, it is probably caused by a blocked expansion valve/ capillary tube. ",
