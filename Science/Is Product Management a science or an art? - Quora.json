            "answer_text": "Ah this is a great question. I will attempt to answer the first question and not the related one. Product Management is both a science and an art. It is an art, if not for any other reason, because a huge part of it is to deal with people and we don't behave rationally all the time. You need to understand each person on your team, what motivates them and what are their goals. Sure, you can read a lot about Psychology (if you have the time, good luck finding time if you are a PM in a startup) and other related fields but there will still be a lot of interactions where you as the PM would have to 'feel' what is the best way to approach a person.  Great Product Managers are great leaders and, almost by extension (in most cases), have great people skills. I will submit that people skills can be taught to a degree but it is a hard, if not the hardest, skill, for a PM to acquire. You either have it and it comes to you naturally (you are a social person, you enjoy being around people, interacting with them, etc.) or you don't and you try to make it up for it. If the people side was a science I would submit anybody could be a Product Manager since you will just follow a 'recipe' on how to deal with all your stakeholders. Clearly, that is not the case. The 'science' part is more clear cut. For the sake of simplification for this question let's call science any process that can be applied to different areas of the Product Manager job and let's list a few areas:  Product Development process: 'science'is applied here, you might be following an agile process, you might follow a certain QA methodology, you also follow a release proces, a build process and so on. Market Analysis: if you are doing competitive analysis you might be doing a SWOT analysis or you might be applying say, Porter's 5 forces to a particular situation. Project Analysis: if you are trying to decide if a project is worth pursuing you most likely are evaluating the project using some sort of Discounted Flow Analysis such as NPV.Project Management: as a PM in a startup you might also be called to do some amount of Project Management. In this case again you will be using some sort of planning/scheduling tool that implements a methodology.In all those areas we can argue there is 'science' applied or, said in another way, there is a method to the madness and a series of steps to follow. With people relationships you might follow a few steps you might have read somewhere but, in my experience, you are relying on the people skills you naturally have. ",
