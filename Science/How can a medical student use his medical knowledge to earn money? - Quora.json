            "answer_text": " How to Make Extra Money as a Medical Student and Resident (www.survivinggrays.com) Posted on October 2, 2013 by Survivor DO Reevaluate Your Housing Aside from tuition, your main expense during medical school and residency is going to be putting a roof over your head. This is the area where some people really blow it. Yes, it is nice to live in a fancy-pants condo in the center of downtown with a state of the art gym but you pay for those luxuries. At the VERY least get a roommate, POOF, your housing expenses were just cut in half! Better yet, get a roommate (or two!) AND some less expensive housing. This is some serious change we\u2019re talking about here. Consider it closely. If you are looking to rent out a spare bedroom intermittently check out RotatingRoom.com I have had great success renting to 4th year medical students. A lot of people wonder whether or not they should buy a house at the beginning of residency. You must weigh the length of your residency and the strength of the local market. You also have to decide if you are okay with taking on the responsibilities of home ownership during an already stressful period. I decided to go this route and it has worked out GREAT for me so far. If you are thinking of taking the plunge I suggest you read about Physician Loans and other pertinent topics at White Coat Investor. Get a Job I get a lot of questions in my inbox asking whether or not it is possible to hold down a job during medical school. The short answer is yes, it is completely possible. A number of my friends worked shifts as nurses during med school and we had a few bartenders as well. They made out okay and certainly appreciated the extra income but the scheduling process took a toll. Unless you can find something with an extremely flexible schedule I would stay away from it. Medical school can be unpredictable and you don\u2019t want to be trudging into work when you really should be spending some extra time in the lab or cramming last second for an exam. QuantiaMD I have talked about QuantiaMD a few times before but I want to mention it again because it is a great concept. The site offers video lectures on topics of interest to physicians. Whether they be medical (i.e. Sulfonylureas in Type II Diabetes), business related (i.e. Will preventive services be incentivized?) or personal (i.e. Financial Cleanup:Your credit report) the site covers a plethora of topics and the videos are well produced. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, they pay you $1-$10 for watching these videos and otherwise contributing to the QuantiaMD community. Pretty freaking good deal in my opinion! To sign up go here and follow the instructions. Unfortunately this opportunity is only available for those with a provider number so you need to be a MD, DO, PA or NP to sign-up. To find your provider number just Google \u201cyour name and NPI\u201d. Amazon Student This one is another win-win. Amazon Student in itself is an awesome service. You get free two-day shipping from Amazon and a reduced rate on Amazon Prime (which is every bit as good as Netflix) just for being a student. It costs you NOTHING to sign-up and if you refer your friends you get $5 for every one of them that signs up. Doesn\u2019t seem like much, but you have a lot of friends, right? Physician Surveys Again, as a physician you are in a unique position. There are only so many of us out there and people want our opinion! I haven\u2019t had a TON of success with physician survey websites but when I do the payout is great \u2013 $20-$100 for giving your opinion for half an hour or so. The two I have had luck with are Curizon and Physician\u2019s Advisory Council. As a side note, there are a lot of \u201cearn $1000\u2019s while taking surveys at home!\u201d sites on the internet that are available to the general public. I got into them for a while but after days of furious clicking I had only made about $100. You\u2019re welcome to give it a shot but I think there are better ways to earn a few bucks. I\u2019ve given all of these ideas a shot as well as making a few dollars from this website. I\u2019m certainly not getting rich and am VERY much looking forward to making an attending\u2019s salary and digging myself out of medical school debt but you will be surprised how much difference $100-$200 a month can make when you put it to good use! Make your choices wisely!   Ways to Make Money in Med School  Kaplan Test Prep will give you a fair shake - 20/hr starting, 8/hr prep time. You may make more at other companies, esp. smaller ones, but Kaplan is huge, and I used to move around a lot so I liked having work anywhere. There's a lot of work if you'ore in a big city. Especially if you're a medical student, ask about being an MCAT Mentor.http://Tutor.com - I posted that above, basically 12/hr for tutoring online.You can probably tutor at your medical school and your local colleges.However, this kind of work is time-consuming and not really relevant to medical school in general, you have to ask yourself if you really have the time to spend doing this kind of work while studying at the same time.Check out other Test Prep companies as well, such as Princeton Review, Berkeley Review, Sylvan, etc. They may offer to pay more. Kaplan is part of a big company though, with all its relevant resources and abilities, so that's nice.Another former Kaplan MCAT teacher gone med student, def true about more acting than teaching. Sucks for the kiddies, but I can see how that would make it GREAT for a med student (I knew a third year who was teaching at the same time as me and loved it). They provide pretty straight-forward/scripted lesson plans, so after you initially master the material the time commitment isn't bad. They're also great at scheduling around you. Spouting the occasional factoid about med school will also get you good reviews = decent pay bonuses. Personally, was not my favorite job, but if you need the money...Could also try emailing the pre-med counselor and heads of the pre-med clubs to offer tutoring, heard about a lot of offers that way.I used to work for Varsity Tutors and Kaplan, both. I liked Varsity a lot more than Kaplan. From my experience, they're a lot more open to negotiating their take on the hourly percent, especially for grad student exam prep, like the MCAT. As with any tutoring, you can also do what I did and use companies like Varsity as, essentially, a door-opener for getting your name known in a community, and then negotiate with your clients and leave the tutoring company out of it. Usually, this can double your hourly pay, and will also be cheaper for the client. Before I started med school, I made around 60 dollars per hour this way, though that was in New York, and it's pretty easy to find rich tutoring clients here.You can sell your body to Science :) I'm just joking. You can sell your notes (personal notes are gold mines in terms of information). You can use also Udemy (http://udemy.com) for sell your courses. https://www.udemy.com/teach/?ref=teach_header Have fun :)I work as a phlebotomist at the weekends but only for a few hours to keep me ticking over.I have some friends that work for my university as scribes for the hearing-impaired - they're usually assigned to after-hours lectures (for lots of different subjects, mostly law) and basically write down everything that happens in that hour. I'm not sure on the details but it pays pretty decent ($25-30 AUD/hr) so maybe something to look into?I know some med students who are on fiver that read/edit personal statements for pre-meds.Sell your semen. Seriously. Assuming you are male; you are highly educated and intelligent, so your genes will likely be worth more than the general public's at a sperm bank. Google to see if there are any near you and make an appointment.I know someone who drove for Uber during her 3rd and 4th years. Something like that might be worth looking into, if you're willing to deal with drunk people (and classmates).I tutor online using Google Hangout and a Wacom tablet. Not a consistent influx of students, but surely a way to make easy money at home on weekends! I posted an ad on a tutor search website for $50ph If you're married, hopefully your spouse is working, which would help a lot with your situation. Aside from the usual budgeting, etc advice, here's some stuff you can do. Tutoring/Teaching - Whether at school, on your own, or at a test prep company. If you're a med student, likely you're good at physics, chemistry, biology, the sciences that many college students struggle with. I work for a test prep company for some pretty good pay from home, although it's a very part-time job.Here's one that's I worked for about a year - http://www.tutor.com/ the pay was around 12/hr, but I basically did all my work from home (max 30 hours). Plasma/Blood DonationsMedical Studies - Depends on what you're willing to risk, but there are studies looking for human volunteers, from what I've seen they seem to pay a few thousand for a few night's stay.Thrifting - I used to go down to Goodwill, look stuff up on my phone to see what had value and resell it on Ebay/Amazon. Made some quick cash that way.Military - HPSP is honestly the best way, but it comes with the huge potential downside of being involved in military medicine. However, if you've had an interest in military medicine like I do, but want to negate a lot of the negatives, consider the National Guard - here's an article about it by the White Coat Investor: Army National Guard Physicians How did you earn money during medical school?

The best way would be to teach students aspiring to join medicine during your vacations. Mind you, don't do it for extended periods of time. You can also apply for scholarships if given out by your state. Currently, my state provides a scholarship of Rs. 10k per year based on merit and financial background of the student. You can also apply for STS research projects. IF selected, you'll get Rs. 5k for the two months you'll be allotted to complete your research project. A few of my friends take money for completing record works, diagrams etc for other classmates. In their defense they were mostly free, wanted the money and didn't want to use their skills for free. Finally, I would like to stress on the fact that as a medical student you should be focused on getting through medical school instead of thinking about earning. You will get ample opportunities to do that when you are a specialist. Spend your time honing your skills and interacting with friends and most importantly, patients.  Good luck ",

As such, he has no authority, although \"authority\" may be implied, and that is not only morally wrong, it is also illegal.  A medical student has a modicum of medical knowledge, and most any medical student is well aware of this. It is quite dangerous to assume that a medical student is on a par with a licensed physician, though many people do believe this. It is up to the student to be wise and correct this notion as needed.  That said, a medical student might consider tutoring nursing students in anatomy, physiology, or pharmacology. That is more akin to sharing expertise, rather than \"using his medical knowledge.\"  The key is in whether someone is will to pay. Otherwise, a medical student's time is best spent in the gross lab, in study group, in the library, reviewing his copious notes, or reading still more to prepare for class. ",

I had a colleague who had a degree in Electrical Engineering who made a few bucks consulting for the Beckman corporation while he was in Medical School.

Despite being in the top 5% of intellect there are still a few in the top 0.1% who can manage. I remember one pharmacist who managed to work part time while in Med School. ",

It certainly needs to be convenient for your class schedule. When I went to Michigan State University, I worked for four years in the dormitory cafeteria washing dishes. It wasn\u2019t glamorous, but it got me through debt free. Most universities employ large numbers of students on a part-time basis because they are far cheaper than hiring full-time staff, and they generally have no transportation issue. They are conveniently located where the work is. ",
