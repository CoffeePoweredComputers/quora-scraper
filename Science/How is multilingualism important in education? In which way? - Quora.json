            "answer_text": "In my experience, multilingualism dramatically expands one\u2019s education. It means first of all that one can travel to a variety of countries with differing languages and appreciate their culture, their museums and the people far more richly than if one were dependent on one\u2019s mother tongue. In addition, multilingualism allows one to learn and appropriate knowledge that would have been inaccessible before. Finally, multilingualism allows one a certain freedom from the misconceptions, stereotypes and commonly held views of one\u2019s own country so that one can literally see the world through new eyes.

I was told that if they weren't English speakers, they weren\u2019t supposed to bein my English classes. It would have been very helpful if I had at least spoken Spanish. ",
