            "answer_text": "While Teddy's answer is definitely correct, it is also a bit simplifying. Essentially, measuring is still the only and best method to determine the melting point of a solid substance, assuming the solid does have one at the given conditions. Some substances, for example, don't melt but go into sublimation, e.g. go directly from solid to gas. For example, solid water (ice) will sublimate under certain conditions instead of going through the liquid phase. A good scientific summary of that topic can be found here: http://www.chem.wisc.edu/courses/342/Fall2004/Melting_Point.pdf  One interesting aspect of the melting point is that not only is it a function of external conditions (pressure), but also a function of purity. For example, only 100% pure substances will have a single temperature as melting point. The moment you got impurities embedded (which can also be physical defects, such as imperfections in crystalline structure), the melting point will become a temparature range. Hence, the most accurate measurement should be done from both sides, e.g. a melting experiment (from solid to liquid) and a crystallization experiment (from liquid to solid). As a side note: I did study the melting of crystalline Gold (Au) on a microscopic scale in my PhD thesis and can tell you that this apparently \"simple\" process of melting is actually a very complicated but extremely interesting physical transition which has multiple \"phases\" from 100% solid crystal to 100% liquid. And, even to define what \"liquid\" means can be rather complicated, when, for example, looking at such interesting substances like Helium (He). ",

            "answer_text": "Not a bad question, we see tables filled with melting points of metals, chemicals etc, but how are they measured or determent ? It depends in what range it is, and to some degree also what product it is; the melting point of butter logically needs an other method/thermometer then for the melting point of Gold or rock/ore. In early days it were mostly manual methods, with just beakers and thermometers, but in this day & age it is mostly done with dedicated machines. For some products there is a strait correlation between the (very) exact melting point and its purity. E.g. Caprolactam ( for making Nylon) with a melting point of 69.13\u00b0C is pretty pure, but a batch with 69.08 \u00b0C may be a bad one / below spec. In the last case it is actually the opposite which is measured, the solidification point, it is the same temp but easier and more accurate to measure. Determination of Melting Point .

If you want to know the melting point of a pure element (for example, lead), you take the material and slowly heat it in an inert atmosphere. You continue carefully raising the temperature until it goes from solid to liquid. All materials experience a change in volume from the solid to the liquid phase. The majority of materials expand and decrease in density when going from solid to liquid, but there are a handful of things (such as water and several post-transition metals) which experience the opposite behavior.

The same device could be used if the substance was new, under documented, or say a new fraction of solvent and solute. It was also presented as a potential QA test. A small amount of a substance was crushed and pressed into a glass tube the size of a match stick. The tube was inserted into a small apparatus that contained a magnifying glass, heater, pressure vessel, pressure gauge, and thermometer. The tube was slowly heated from the outside to minimize other heat transfer mechanisms while it was closely watched. When outer crystals started to weep then that temperature was noted. When the crystals turned to liquid, temp noted. The process was repeated for statistical significance. This was melting point for one pressure. Sometimes the process was repeated for pressures above and below. The process was also repeated with a substance(s) used as a control/calibration. Again, one method for one gadget. ",

We have a suitable means of measuring the temperature (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) when this transition occurs. The apparatus with the sample is slowly heated from a temperature where the sample is 100% solid to the point where some of the solid has turned to liquid. This, then, is the melting point. We have to be careful not to heat the sample too quickly or else we will scoot past the true melting point. ",
