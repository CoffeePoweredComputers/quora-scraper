            "answer_text": "Energy of movement. Basically you need to push on something to make it move and doing this uses energy. Kinetic energy can be converted to and from other forms of energy. For example: when you ball is thrown up in the air, stored chemical energy in your muscles is used to add kinetic energy the ball. As it moves up, kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy and the ball stops momentarily before falling down. At the microscopic level, heat is also a form of kinetic energy. The temperature of an object is a measure of the average kinetic energy of it\u2019s molecules. When the object is hotter, it\u2019s molecules are bouncing around faster. Depending on the problem, it may be more useful to treat heat as a separate form of energy, but it is actually an energy of movement. ",

            "answer_text": "Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because it is moving. Anything which gets in its way wil have that kinetic energy transferred to it causing a force to act. This force will cause a dent in the thing that got in its way. Whenever a force acts energy is transformed from one form to another. In this case kinetic energy gets transformed into heat, vibration and sound, which are all forms of energy. ",
