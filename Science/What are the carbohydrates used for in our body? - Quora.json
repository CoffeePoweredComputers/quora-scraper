            "answer_text": "Carbs are varied. There are complex carbohydrates that are absorbed slowly and you hardly get an insulin reaction. On the other end of the spectrum there are refined carbs like sugar, which are rapidly absorbed in the gut and to which the body reacts swiftly with an insulin reaction to lower high blood sugars. Generally speaking all carbs are broken down into glucose and absorbed in the gut. Glucose is the fuel that is metabolized inside the cells in the mitochondria to give us energy. Mitochondria - The Cell - NCBI Bookshelf. This is particularly important in the brain, which lives solely by glucose as the energy supply, but our muscles, our heart, our liver and kidneys are all very rich in mitochondria for the metabolism of glucose. But there is a dark side to refined carbs that we need to know about: when all our glucose storage spaces in the liver and the muscles are full (glycogen is the storage form of glucose), then the liver starts processing glucose. With our sugar consumption having spiralled upwards in the last 183 years this surplus sugar metabolism is causing more and more problems.  The liver produces triglycerides from the extra sugar and LDL cholesterol, the bad cholesterol. This causes hardening of the arteries and causes heart attacks, strokes and high blood pressure. We need to come to our senses and cut out processed foods (which has extra sugar in it), switch to a Mediterranean diet and only consume complex carbs, contained in legumes, vegetables and fruit. It is also recommendable to cut out starchy foods with a glycemic index of higher than 55 in order to bring our liver metabolism back to normal (normal triglyceride and LDL cholesterol production). This will mean cutting out pasta, potatoes, rice, bread and muffins.

            "answer_text": "Carbohydrates play the role of supplying long lasting energy in the body. Marathon runners are always told to bulk up on carbs the week before a race, because they are running for a long period of time, and need that energy for the entire run! There are, however, different carbohydrates. There are simple carbs, and complex carbs. Simple carbs, are known as the \u2018unhealthy\u2019 side of carbohydrates, and do not supply long lasting energy like they are supposed to. Examples of simple carbohydrates include; Baked Goods (muffins, croissants) Cookies Cereals Soda Pie Juice Complex carbs contain the nutrients needed to sustain the body. They are the healthy side of carbohydrates. Examples of complex carbohydrates include; Vegetables Fruits Beans Whole/Multi-Grains Quinoa So there you have it, don't try going on a low-carb diet to lose weight. Instead, you should try cutting out simple carbs and replacing them with complex carbs to help your body attain the energy it needs! Hope this helps! (The Role Of Carbohydrates In The Body_) ",

            "answer_text": "Carbohydrate is a pretty large variety of substances. It can cover anything from pure glucose to insoluble fiber. So, it depends upon what type of carbohydrate you\u2019re talking about. A lot of carbohydrates are simply long chains of simple sugar molecules that are rapidly broken down by the body. Now, I\u2019ve got to address the issue of \u201cenergy.\u201d See in some people carbohydrates give them energy. However, for a certain percent of the population, they get too much and it actually can make them lethargic and quite sedentary. Your body does not need carbohydrates as fuel. It can get by quite well without them. As a matter of fact some very ultra endurance runners actually prefer to fuel their bodies without carbohydrate. They prefer to use ketones in the body and their natural body fat as sources of energy. Repeat after me - \u201cYour body does not need dietary carbohydrate. It is not an essential nutrient.\u201d ",
