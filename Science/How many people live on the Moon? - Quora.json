            "answer_text": "How many people live on the Moon? Joseph Smith, the founder and prophet of Mormonism, said \u201cInhabitants of the Moon are more of a uniform size than the inhabitants of the Earth, being about 6 feet in height. They dress very much like the Quaker Style & are quite general in Style, or the one fashion of dress. They live to be very old; comeing [sic] generally, near a thousand years.\u201d, but didn\u2019t say how many. Sorry. Brigham Young, the second prophet of Mormonism said \u201c\u201cWho can tell us of the inhabitants of this little planet that shines of an evening, called the moon?... When you inquire about the inhabitants of that sphere you find that the most learned are as ignorant in regard to them as the ignorant of their fellows. So it is in regard to the inhabitants of the sun. Do you think it is inhabited? I rather think it is. Do you think there is any life there? No question of it; it was not made in vain.\u201d But, he also didn\u2019t say how many. Sorry. Of course, those quotes are from the 1800s, so things could have changed since then. The astronauts that went to the moon in the 1960s saw no one, and no evidence of anyone, so either those 6 footers left and cleaned the place very well before leaving, or they\u2019re living inside the moon now. Kind of a long post with no answer. Sorry. ",

            "answer_text": "According to my sources, the Moons gravity is about 70% to that of Earth, therefore it can hold down an atmosphere (which is breathable).* There are between 1.5 and 2 Billion \u201cMoon People\" (ET\u2019s) living on the moon. They look identical to \u201cEarth People\u201d but more advanced. They live right on the surface, not below ground. Tobias Mayer crater contains structures. It is 33.15 km in diameter. Aristarchus is a large 23 mile diameter nuclear power plant that glows blue due to the Cheren\u0137kov effect. There is a city in the Petavius B crater. There is a Terminal on the farside which has gangways that radiate out similar to Earth Airports. *Peter Andreas Hansen was a Danish Mathematician/Physicist/Astronomer who had Moon gravity theories dating back to the mid 1800\u2032s.
