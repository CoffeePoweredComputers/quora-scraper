            "answer_text": "The rate constant can be any positive value (even as high as 10^9). The rate constant of a reaction is its intrinsic rate when the concentrations of all its reactants is unity. k>1 means the reaction is fast (depending on temperature), also entropy increases as product is formed. Its like asking what does it mean when a car moves faster than 140 km/h (or any other mark)\u2026. I may not be able to provide you the exact answer you want, I just tried :) ",
