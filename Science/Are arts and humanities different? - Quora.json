            "answer_text": "Arts and humanities teach critical thinking skills, analysis, research, and problem solving. These majors foster a deeper sense of self, a love of knowledge, and independent thinking. As Barbra Streisand said \u201cArt does not exist only to entertain, but also to challenge one to think, to provoke, even to disturb in a constant search for the truth\u201d. Arts and humanities are considered as two of the oldest fields of knowledge available. The difference between the two is often seen with ambiguity. While art is seen as a more all-inclusive field, humanities, on the other hand, takes into consideration a diverse and oftentimes unrelated set of disciplines from literature to political history. People learn to adapt their expectations and achieve flexibility in any endeavour. They have excellent skills in writing, speaking, reading, and communicating. Art as a term dates back to the thirteenth century. From the Indo-European root & which means to assemble or join, it has since encompassed a number of forms such as literature, film, music, sculpture, painting, and, more recently, photography. Humanities focus on the more man-cantered disciplines compared to art. These are academic fields in which the human condition is prioritized rather than their works. The meaning of humanity has been changing for ages. From the ancient period to the modern era it has become a subject along with arts which is vastly popular all over the world. These two are the pillars for culture, history, and tradition of any place which is either of past, present or future. Regardless of their rich history and achievements, the query still remains. Although two separate fields of study, art and humanities have long been a part of man's life whether one likes it or not. Thanks for reading\u2026 Follow us so you\u2019ll never miss an update ",

They deal more with the facts of what society wrought, not the creative combustion that drove creation, like literature, plays, paintings etc. Arts is the expression of the creativity in both fact and theory of those societies. What is the conscience of the creator, the trigger of the creation, the soul of the creation, etc. What are the technologies and how to employ them. The resulting products, etc., are included, but not the limiting factor. ",

Here\u2019s an example: When the late great De Kooning was struggling to arrive at in his painting complete originality and authenticity, the street in front of his studio home was being dug up for a subway line. He found a discarded book in the mess, a book illustrating shorthand for court reporters, who used shorthand they would later translate into full language to record trials. Needing some kind of armature in the painting to hang action applied paint to, he used the symbols illustrated, combining the dug up dirt as thick paint smears applied on the drawn symbols, etc. The duality you reference is code for the academic specialties under this umbrella in a Uni?
