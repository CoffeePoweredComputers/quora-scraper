            "answer_text": " FCC/CCP. I know these sound like FDR-era federal agencies, but they stand for face-centered cubic AKA cubic close packed. These describe how atoms are stacked upon one another to form the crystal.  Compare FCC with, say hexagonal close packed (HCP)   In HCP, layers A and C are parallel to one another. The atoms of Layer B are in the interstitial sites (the holes) that are between the atoms of Layer A. Layer C is placed in the interstitial spaces of Layer B but matches up parallel (atom for atom) with Layer A, so layer B is sandwiched between 2 identical layers.  In CCP, You lay down layer A, you place layer B within the interstitial sites above layer A, and then layer C is further placed in interstitial sites, and the atoms do not line up parallel with either layers A or B.  When you keep stacking, you end up with a cubic structure (it stacks on an incline):   Another thing to know about FCC crystals is that there are  two types of tetrahedral holes and one type of octahedral hole. In NaCl, the sodium ions fill the octahedral holes. It is difficult to describe, but this basically means refers to the holes that are there between two stacked sets of three atoms (in this case, chloride ions), rather than within the space that lies between a single atom and the space of a triple (see below). The sodium ion goes goes between the chloride \"six nearest neighbors,\" and therefore there is octahedral symmetry.   ",

If you're not sure what it is that you're looking for, it's this flashy green and white number:  Sodium chloride  Oddly enough, your question is technically eponymous.  The sodium chloride crystal structure is common enough that that IS what it's called.  It's sometimes called the Halite crystal structure, or, more generically, face-centered cubic.
