            "answer_text": "Define wisdom!! Human wisdom allegedly comes with age eg Wisdom teeth. however we all know the expression there is no fool like an old fool. Real wisdom to Christians is different. \u201cThe fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom\u201d. Fear means awe not terror. I believe wisdom comes from god. God alone. Jesus reveals god and his Holy Spirit within me renews my mind. Paul wrote \u201cthe crucifixion is blasphemy to the Jews and folly to the Greeks\u201d: meaning, today, offensive to the religious and foolish to the educated, or worldly wise. so I don\u2019t expect anyone to agree with me and philosophers will think we are stupid but I believe true wisdom comes from god, and is found in his word: the Bible is the written word, Jesus is the word made flesh and the holy spirit writes his word on our hearts. Take it or leave it, accept it or reject it; the honest should at least explore it for themselves. ",

What about all those who are logical, reasonable, rational, skeptical and therefore wise who don\u2019t believe in any gods? Of course wisdom can be found outside the bible and Christianity. The Bible is just a collection of books written in the Bronze Age! ",
