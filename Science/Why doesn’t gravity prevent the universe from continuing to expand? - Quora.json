            "answer_text": "Inertia + Expansion = Gravity (Nov 7, 2017).1.pdf[1] The answer to the question as to why gravity does not prevent expansion was correctly answered by Carlos Santacruz, specifically \u201cGravity is caused by expansion\u201d Other Quoran\u2019s, including myself, have have posted similar statements. Without going into whether Santachez\u2019s \u201cThe Empty Universe Theory\u201d is correct or complete, the following explanation is proffered: Richard Feynman appears to be the first to suggest the possibility that gravity could be a pseudo force. Reasoning from the proposition that local g forces, like pseudo forces, are always proportional to the masses, \u201cis it not possible that gravitation is due simply to the fact we do not have the right coordinate system?\u201d Pseudo forces require a primary acceleration, and since gravity is, in general, a 3-d phenomena, one needs a 3-d source to create a 3-d reactionary field. Where might one find an isotropic 3-d acceleration field? We need not look far. Big G is everywhere - a universal three dimensional expansion field having dimensional units: \u201c cubic meters per second squared per kg\u201d In words, the dimension units of big G are volumetric acceleration per unit mass (m^3/sec^2)/kg. Big G represents accelerating volume. But does it have the correct value to comport with what we now know to be the expansion rate of the universe? Ironically, it was Einstein that (regrettably) first proposed a cosmological constant (CC) to prevent gravitational collapse of his static model of the universe. He calculated the (CC) would have to have a value 3H^2, whence, when multiplied by R/3, the counter-field acceleration would have a value (CC)(R/3) = (3H^2)(R/3) = c^2/R. Net force would be zero if (CC) = 4(pi)G(p)\u2026\u2026\u2026..(1) where p is the density But the above equation assumes that gravity and expansion are independent forces (Thought to be finely tuned to balance such that for most of the 20th century, it could not be determined which would win out {gravity or expansion}) The imagined hyperbole should have been resolved by the 1998 discovery that the universe was accelerating at the rate c^2/R just as Einstein had calculated 85 years earlier. But there was in reality no fine tuning except in the minds of the cosmologists that did not realize for 100 years that gravity is actually a consequence of expansion. To see this, simply use the above relationship (1) and solve for G. G = (CC)/4(pi)p =3H^2/4(pi)p This is simply Friedmann\u2019s formulation. Now substitute M/(4/3)pi(R^3) for p and c/R for H, and find G = [c^2/R] x K where K is a constant [(m^2)/kg] x 1/4(pi)kg The cosmological expansion factor c^2/R is embedded in G.

            "answer_text": "The Universe was shown to be a lightspeed expanding hyperspherical hypersurface: Marco Pereira's post in Hypergeometrical Universe This means that the Universe looks like this:  where the \u2018surface\u2018 is actually 3D and the radius is expanding at the speed of light. We know that Gravitation, Electromagnetism are 3D forces, that is, they only change our position or velocity within the Universe (they don\u2019t move us out of the Universe or hypersurface). This means that they have no influence upon the motion of the Universe. Another way to see that is to just reverse time and see the hypersphere to become smaller and denser. One can see from the topology (shape) that mass would be equally distributed in every direction. This means that the Gravitational Pull would be ZERO and Gravitation wouldn\u2019t have any influence upon dynamics. That is the reason why Gravitation does not create a Big Crunch. We never came out of a POINT. We started this Universe as a Zero Kelvin Blackholium already with a 147 light-second 4D radius. IN SUMMARY Topology (the shape of the Universe) is what prevents the Universe from collapsing into a point. Astronomical evidence shows that the Universe is a lightspeed expanding hyperspherical hypersurface and thus it is a bounded 3D Surface embedded inside a 4D spatial manifold. ",
