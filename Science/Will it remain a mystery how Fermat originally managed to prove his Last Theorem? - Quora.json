It's possible that somebody in the future may yet come up with a simpler proof (Very unlikely however). Fermat might have had a proof (Atleast, he probably thought he did). History is rife with incorrect proofs for FLT. It's possible that he had some basic proof in his head (Which was very likely wrong), and if he never even bothered to write it down, it's fair to say he never really analyzed the proof properly. Remember, FLT was only important because it turned out to be so hard to prove, and required so many new discoveries. If Fermat thought he had a (probably incorrect) proof already, he may have thought that the result, while interesting, is not worth going into depth for (And so, without sharing the result or the proof with other mathematicians, he may have never found the error in his proof).
