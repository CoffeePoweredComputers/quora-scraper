            "answer_text": " Is he, though? As with almost every issue, he\u2019s on every side of the issue. He says what seems easiest for him in any given moment, but feels no obligation to stick with any particular position or act consistently with his latest position. It\u2019s typically very obvious what his real position is though because he might make 300 statements on an issue and only 5 or 10 of them go one way, and all the others go the other way. This gives him and his supporters the ability to point to those other statements when convenient, as a defense, but it\u2019s rarely difficult for his followers to discern what he really wants when the vast majority of his statements go the other way. Not only do they go the other way, they\u2019re typically far more loud and intense, as well as spontaneous. Conversely, the ones he doesn\u2019t really mean but just says to give a fig leaf of deniability or to squirm out of a tough question, are usually more soft spoken and half-hearted, more equivocal with slippery qualifiers, and not repeated much. Add to that the fact that he avoids ever being seen wearing a mask, and has mocked those who do, and it\u2019s really not difficult to see where he stands on that particular issue. If he were to truly reverse himself on masks and mean it, there\u2019d be no doubt. He\u2019d say it loud, proud, and often, across every medium, with the vitriolic fury he\u2019s notorious for. Therefore, to answer the question, his supporters won\u2019t respond until he means it, and he clearly doesn\u2019t mean it. He doesn\u2019t want to see people wearing masks because it\u2019s the clearest possible sign that the pandemic is real, not a hoax, and not at all under control. He cares much less about whether it is under control than whether it looks like it\u2019s under control. He cares about \u201cthe numbers\u201d but not the people. It\u2019s why he wants testing reduced and why he wanted to strand Americans on cruise ships. He told us himself, he liked where the numbers were and didn\u2019t want them to go up. He cares about the economy, but not the people who run it. That\u2019s why he rushed to get everyone back out, before the problem was addressed and before any of them met his own government\u2019s guidance for when that would be safe. That\u2019s why he\u2019s now running around threatening states and schools with funding cuts if they don\u2019t fully open, even when they can\u2019t meet his own government\u2019s guidance for safe reopening. Is he trying to help solve their challenges? Get them more resources? No, he\u2019s trying to get the standards dropped and threatening anyone who stands in his way. Why? Because he cares about education? Because he cares about public safety? No to both. It\u2019s because he knows people can\u2019t get back to work without child care. It\u2019s all about the economy, which is all about his reelection. He cares about his reelection, but not the people he\u2019s supposed to serve. And he maintains the ridiculous belief that ignoring the dangers and pretending they\u2019re not there is better than addressing them. He wants the grandeur of accomplishment without doing the work to earn and deserve it. He wants to skip the hard work of solving the problem and go right to the celebration and benefits of having solved it. His every action bears this out.

            "answer_text": " Trumps mask \u201csupport\u201d is really just two faced lip service because of the EU Travel ban. \u201cI looked like the Lone Ranger in a black mask\u201d - Cute \u2026  \u2026 wrong kind of mask Don, and the Trump campaign paints Biden as \u201cmentally diminished\u201d Many Trump supporters will continue the gas-lighting and say Trump has been for masks the whole time.  Reality doesn\u2019t treat gas-lighting well - In the U.S. an unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response has not prevented marked increases in Social Instability Risk, Government Instability Risk, and Geopolitical Risk (see webapp), all trends we expect to continue given a resurgence of infections; higher political opposition to further stimulus; and a highly contentious election in November.The United States \u2014 marked by high social polarization and declining state capacity under the Trump administration \u2014 had the largest Covid-19 Political Risk premium in the set, which we forecast would increaseForecasting Country Risk Amid Covid-19 Look for a total ban for Americans traveling to the developed world by next Monday. More states will impose 14 day quarantines to enter from Trump states. It really doesn\u2019t matter what Trumpist think, the world, business, and responsible states are already taking steps against the mask-less.  What amazes me is that many may get sick with a good amount of deaths, and the Trumpists don\u2019t realize that Trump is too vain to mess up his make-up with a mask.   Walmart, Home Depot, Lowes, etc have limited entrances and doubled security in CA - you don\u2019t get in without a mask in California anymore. The Kens & Karen\u2019s rage. ",
