            "answer_text": "No - except in special circumstances. Measuring the isotopes of uranium and lead in certain crystals such as zircon and monazite can allow the time since crystallization to be determined with an accuracy better than 1%. The important point is that when zircon, for example, crystallizes, it can incorporate uranium atoms into its crystal lattice, but not lead atoms. Once locked inside the solid crystal, the uranium atoms decay into lead atoms at a known rate and the lead is held fast within the solid crystal. By measuring the lead and uranium contents it is possible to determine the time the crystal has been in existence. A further detail is that there are two distinct isotopes of uranium - 235 and 238 - which decay into two different isotopes of lead - 207 and 206 - at two different rates. This provides a check on the accuracy and guards against possible errors such as leakage of the lead. The method depends on the original source rock cooling slow enough for crystals to form. None of this applies to an impact. The impact is unlikely to have raised the temperature to the 2190 degrees C necessary to melt zircon, and even if it did, then the material would probably cool too quickly to provide useful crystals. Uranium lead dating of meteorites dates their formation, not their impact with Earth. The exception can be for large impacts such as the one at the K-T boundary which caused large scale melting of the rocks at the impact site. Some of these rocks - especially tektites ejected into the atmosphere have been dated by uranium lead dating, although mostly other radioactive isotopes were used for dating. ",
