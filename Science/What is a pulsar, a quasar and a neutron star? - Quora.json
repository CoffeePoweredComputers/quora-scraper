            "answer_text": "Let's start with a neutron star. Stars have a life cycle too. As they age, they grow larger and eventually collapse under their own gravity. When massive stars collapse, they do so in a fiery explosion making them a supernova. As the mass that was held by them disperses, what remains is a small ball of mass. It is of the size of a city, but is extremely dense. In fact, neutron stars are one of the most dense objects. The gravitational pressure makes protons and electrons to become neutrons and make up for most of its density.   A star rotates about its axis. When it goes supernova, it does lose a lot of its mass. However, in order to maintain angular momentum, it has to spin faster now [1]. Much faster. And when it does, it emits a blast of radiation along its magnetic field lines. When observed from earth, we see a pulsating beam of light. This is what gives birth to a pulsar. [Think of it as a lighthouse, where the beam of light is more intense, when directly pointed at you]   The first pulsar was discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Antony Hewis. The period of this pulsar was about 1.33 seconds. When pulsars first form, they have high rotational speed. As millions of years pass by, they eventually slow down, and stop radiating. During the time they are active, they have a regularity that can be used to keep track of time. Also, these pulsars can act as a guide for stellar navigation, someday, if we ever build star-ships.   Pulsars, BTW, can steal the mass from any star that comes too close.   Coming to Quasars, they are the result of super-massive blackholes, generally from ones at the center of galaxies. When matter gets near massive blackholes, an accretion disc [2] is formed, that eventually heats up and starts radiating. Quasars are one of the most luminous objects in the universe. The radiation from the Quasars manifest as jets that can stretch up to light years. A Quasar should be continuously fed, otherwise, it will stop radiating. If at all, there isn't dust and gas to power the blackhole, the quasar becomes quiet. An event, like collision of galaxies may power the Quasar back on.    The center of our galaxy could've been a quasar, but it doesn't have dust and gas to feed on. When eventually, our galaxy collides with Andromeda, the quasar could power back on.  Here are some images of Quasars and Pulsars:   \"Quasar viewed from Hubble\" - Source: Wikipedia | Available for re-use under creative commons.   \"Vela Pulsar jet\" by NASA/CXC/PSU/G.Pavlov et al. - High Energy Astrophysics Picture Of the Week. Licensed under Public Domain via Commons - File:Vela Pulsar jet.jpg  [1] Think of an ice-skater who spins. Image them spinning with their arms spread out. Now, while spinning, if they bring their arms closer, they will spin faster. To preserve angular momentum, as size decreases, the rotational speed should increase [2] An accretion disc is a swirling ring of gas and dust that is under the influence of the gravity of a massive body. When the small dust particles collide, they form larger particles, which keep growing. Further reading: PulsarNeutron starQuasar",

            "answer_text": "A quasar is a form of galactic nuclei found at very large astronomical distances away from Earth (one of the closest is 3C 273, which is around 749Mpc away from Earth), because of this, they are theorized to have played a part in the earlier universe. They are several thousand times more luminous than the Milky Way, and are a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a large accretion disk which orbits the SMBH. When matter from the accretion disk is 'absorbed' , energy is released as EM radiation, which are the two two glowing rays.  Neutron stars are what remains of the core of a supernova after it undergoes extreme compression from gravitational collapse once the outer layers have been exploded from the star. The compression squashes the core to extremely high densities, more than that of a white dwarf. They get their name as they are theorised to be completely made of neutrons. A pulsar is a type of neutron star, which rotates with incredibly fast speeds, taking several milliseconds to a few seconds to complete one full revolution. They are highly magnetised and emit beams of EM radiation at opposite ends. They get their name as their light appears to pulsate, because they can only be visible if a beam points towards Earth. They are formed in the exact same way as a neutron star, except they keep some of their angular momentum, but as the radius is much smaller than the star, its rotational speed is increased. The pulsar has two axes, a rotational axis and a magnetic axis. The magnetic axis is where the beams are emitted from, while the pulsar rotates around the rotational axis. Neutron Stars Neutron stars are formed as a large star callapses in a Type II Supernovae. The Supernovae blows off much of the star, and you are left with the collapsed iron core of a star (this happens to stars that have a mass about 8 to about 25 times the mass of the Sun). The remaining iron core collapses down to about 20 kilometers wide, but it still maintains a mass between 1.5 to 5 times the mass of our Sun (a pretty impressive little thing, no?). Neutron stars are typically about 20 kilometers or so, about the size of a decent sized city. Think about that for a second, something more massive than the sun the size of a city. You can imagine the Neutron star is immensely dense. So dense, a teaspoon sized Neutron star matter would weigh about 100 million tons! The crust of the Neutron star would also be about 100 billion times stronger than steel. Why do we call them \u201cneutron stars\u201d? Fist. neutrons are the uncharged, neutral particles in the middle of atoms. But why did we name the star after those tiny, tiny particles? Well, because the star is made up of neutrons. As the star collapses, the mass of the star creates so much gravity that the protons and electrons fuse together. Now, what happens when you add one positive and one negative number? That\u2019s right, nothing. We\u2019re left with one neutrally charged particle. A Neutron. What are Pulsars Let\u2019s say our figure skater goes into a spin. Typically, a skater starts off with her arms and one leg spread out. As she draws her arms and leg in towards her body, she starts spinning faster and faster. This is an example of the Law of Angular Momentum, which a complex way to say\u2013 when something spins and shrinks in size, but keeps the same mass, the object spins faster. The same happens with a Neutron star. The star has shrunk in size, but maintained its mass, so it spins very fast. The record speed is 1122 rotations in one second, with the record slowest speed is one rotation in 4.308 seconds. Now, a Neutron star has a solid core and a \u201cliquid\u201d mantle. Its crust is only about an inch thick, but the solid core and \u201cliquid\u201d mantle gives the star a magnetic field, and with its mass and density, the field is about a trillion times as strong as Earth\u2019s. Neutron stars emit high-energy beams at its North and South magnetic poles, which is usually made from material from a companion star. If these beams are pointed at Earth, as the Neutron star rotates, they seem to pulse. So we came up with the name Pulsar. ",
