As I recalled it's starts with wind causing tiny waves. These then overlap and join together because of surface tension. This gives them a larger surface for the wind to effect them more. Plus of course gravity drives them forward. When the water depth reaches 1/2 wavelength the waves touch bottom, get higher, and eventually curl because the bottom of the wave is slowing down while the top continues with its previous momentum.
