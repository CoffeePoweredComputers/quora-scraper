            "answer_text": "Short answer, most of the times. LONG ANSWER: I always say that reading is very dynamic. There is no book in the world which everyone likes or everyone should read. In other terms, literature is subjective and depends heavily on perspective. What you consider a must read may be outright banned in other countries. So such a comparison does not make sense. If you cannot define quality of a book without being biased, how do you judge if an author is better than the other? Remember that popularity of a book is no measure of its quality, its the measure of how many people believed that book to be on their mental and intellectual level. Half-Girlfriend, for example, is so popular, but in my opinion it is totally shit. Emphasis on \u2018in my opinion\u2019. But still, seeing the current trend in Indian literature, I'd have to say that you have a better chance of finding a \u2018good book\u2019 if you pick up an American/English/Australian bestseller rather than Indian bestseller. Most books which hit the shelves in smll cities in India these days are shit. And it makes me very sad. India\u2019s heritage in literature is bigger and better than any other single country. Vedas, BhagvadGita, Mahabharata, the list just goes on and on. Faeries, vampires, werewolves and shapeshifters, seers, soothsayers, all were invented by Indian literature. And see where we are going. Still, there are good Indian authors even today. Amish Tripathi, Ashwin Sanghi, Arundhati Roy, Aravind Adiga, Amitav Ghosh (the A-streak, I call it), Jhumpa Lahiri,, etc. Another thing to keep in mind is, the more popular foreign authors are the ones who are the best in their countries. India\u2019s best still stands somewhere in the international scenario, though not with its head held high. So yeah, majority of foreign authors are better than the majority of Indian authors, in my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously the former is better than the latter; simply because India as a country and its countrymen(read Indian authors) are still in the phase of learning and adapting to the different ways of writing(as a medium of expression). Most of all that is being read presently coming from the Indian authors is less exploratory of the actualities of our lives. Although authors try to pitch well into the intricacies & nuances but find it hard to stick on to it. There are a plethora of genres,subjects and ideologies to write about but we Indians ( again read Indian authors) tend to fall back and forth into the same love stories(mainly) apart from that the mythology(which is largely prevalent in our country). Ways of writing & expressing are innumerable we need to expand excessively, introspect why is that we Indians have the urge NOW to write more than ever ? Is it peer pressure/alternative career path/ Need to express just to mention a few out of a whole lot of a possible reasons. Nonetheless there of course are and were great Indians( one last time ;read Indian authors) like Arundhati Roy, Salman Rushdie,Rabindranath Tagore, Amitav Ghosh,Romila Thapar just to name a few. Believe you me I am not fully anti Indian authors though; since I aspire to be one :D ",

You might not like a specific author, but geographical boundaries shouldn't be the deciding factor, unless you pick up a book in Chinese and you can\u2019t read Chinese :) ",
