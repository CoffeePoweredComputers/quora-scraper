            "answer_text": "Suppose you have a first order reaction A \u2192 B The rate equation is -d[A]/dt = k [A] where k is the rate constant. Note that the rate, -d[A]/dt, is \u201cchange in molar concentration of A with time.\u201d not fractional change of A with time. If you perform a series of kinetic experiments starting with different concentrations of A and measure the initial velocity of each reaction, (-d[A]/dt), a plot of initial velocity versus [A] gives a straight line with a slope = k. It is the proportionality constant for the reaction. The units of k for the first order reaction are 1/time, such as 1/min, so that the units on both sides of the equation are the same. Perhaps an easy way to get an intuitive grasp of k is to recognize that is related to the half life of the reaction. For a first order reaction, t(1/2) = 0.693/k. This is the time it takes for the concentration of A to drop by half. Larger values of k mean faster reactions and shorter half lives. If you look at a reaction coordinate diagram, k is related to the activation energy for the reaction. The lower the activation energy, the larger the rate constant.  ",

            "answer_text": "The rate constant reflects how fast the reaction is going to take and is determined by the concentration of the reactants, the concentration of the products and how the concentration of products are being formed with respect to the reactants. Temperature, mixing, catalysts and other factors can cause the reaction constant to change. Here\u2019s a good link that explains some of that and the Arrhenius equation. rate constants and the arrhenius equation ",
