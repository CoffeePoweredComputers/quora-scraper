            "answer_text": "All shockwaves travel AT the speed of sound. An object travelling faster than the speed of sound CREATES the shockwave\u2026 but the shockwave itself propagates out at the speed of sound. CLARIFICATION: the speed of sound for whatever medium the shockwave is travelling through. Speed of sound through a solid is faster than it is through a gas, etc.. So you may feel the impact tremor of a meteorite strike long before you hear and feel the shockwave through the air. ",
