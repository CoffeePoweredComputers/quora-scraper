            "answer_text": "Actually, the vast, vast majority of politicians (like the vast, vast majority of all individuals) believe that the climate changes. But many politicians and individuals (hundreds of millions) are skeptical of the hypothesis that human emissions of CO2 are leading to apocalyptic global warming because there absolutely is NO proof of it. It is completely speculation based upon untested suppositions. In fact, this hypothesis cannot even be tested; therefore, it falls into the realm of pseudoscience as defined by Karl Popper, a renowned British academician and philosopher of science. Thus, anyone who completely believes this hypothesis is doing so by faith or because they have been fooled by others who claim it is proven. https://www.quora.com/What-is-some-evidence-that-proves-the-existence-of-climate-change/answer/John-Walker-922 https://www.quora.com/Why-do-there-seem-to-be-so-many-climate-change-sceptics/answer/John-Walker-922 John Walker's answer to I\u2019m 17 and worry about climate change.

I\u2019m an exact sciences researcher and I don\u2019t believe anything at all - I either know, or I do not. Belief is not my preferred guide through nature and reality only confirmed data and exact interpretation of their meaning is taken into my consideration. There are tons of publications on UFO\u2019s and Alien abduction subjects as well. These exponentially growing statistics are not proving any of it - and certainly not making the matters worst for the abducted, because in real life - there aren\u2019t any ! So, sleep well and do your morning gym. ",
