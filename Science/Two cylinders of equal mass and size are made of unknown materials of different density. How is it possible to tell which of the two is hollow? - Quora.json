            "answer_text": "Let them roll down an inclined plane. The one reaching the bottom first will be the solid one. If the two cylinders are allowed to roll down an inclined plane without slipping (keeping the initial conditions same), both will reach the bottom with same total kinetic energy. However the rotational kinetic energy will be greater in the hollow cylinder, since the particles of its mass are further from the centre. Therefore the hollow cylinder acquires lesser translational kinetic energy than the solid one. For this reason the hollow cylinder will roll down an inclined plane without slipping slower than the solid one. ",
