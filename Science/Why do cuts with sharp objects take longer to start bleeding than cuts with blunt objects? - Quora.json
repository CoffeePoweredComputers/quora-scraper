            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll begin by saying I\u2019m only a high school student. From what I learned in anatomy when you get a cut with a sharp object you now have a small clean cut in you skin. Since you skin is always under a small amount of tension even when your skin has a cut your bodies immediate reaction is to tighten the blood vessels around it to reduce bleeding following with the body sending platelets to the affected area to clump up and prevent bleeding. Now a blunt object doesn\u2019t cause a cut on the skin (unless were speaking of a laceration or internal bleeding) where the blood vessels beneath the skin are destroyed hence they cannot tighten up to prevent bleeding and since the blood vessels are destroyed platelets cannot function in their proper manner , therefore the bleeding is immediate like when you get a hit with a blunt object on the head or other part of the body.

            "answer_text": "Let me preface this answer by saying that I am not a doctor, nor do I have any medical training. Please take my answer as speculative reasoning. If I had to guess, I would say that a cut made by a very sharp object is much narrower than a cut made with a more blunt object. Consequently, the sides of the cut are still pressed against each other with some amount of force and the blood tends to ooze out rather than gushing. Meanwhile, a broad cut made by a blunt instrument has had a fair-sized chunk of flesh torn away, which means that the damaged blood vessels are open and exposed, allowing the blood to flow freely. Of course, that\u2019s just a guess. I could be wrong. ",
