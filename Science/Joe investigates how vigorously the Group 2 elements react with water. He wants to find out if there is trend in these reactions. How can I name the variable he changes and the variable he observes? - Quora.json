What he is observing is the vigor of the reactions with water \u2026 how would you normally tell if one reaction was more or less vigorous than another? What do you normally call that? What he is changing is the element in group II being tested. So when you change elements in group II, what are you changing? (Look on a periodic table to see.) ",
