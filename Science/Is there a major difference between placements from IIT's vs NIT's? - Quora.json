            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A There are basically two major differences : Number of companies visiting : There is a difference in number of companies visiting for on campus placements of NITs and IITs. Though the difference isn\u2019t much for top NITs and IITs. But still IITians get placememt opportunity in various international companies which never visit NITs or any other top tier college other than IITs. There are some domestic companies which pay really high and visit IITs only.Salary offered : Now this is a very significant difference as almost every company especially investment banks, hedge funds and high frequency trading firms tend to pay IITians a lot more than they offer NITians or any other top college for similar job profile. I am not sure of new IITs but in established IITs you will be paid much higher for the same role in the same company than your any other college counterpart.Placements are great in top NITs and IITs but you can say that IITians are the first preference of every company and they fight to visit their campuses for day 0. Hiring is good for other colleges as well but being an IITian will always have its merit :) ",

There are 23 IITs and 31 NITs in India till date. The difference is the quality of education, reputation, placement records, etc. which is all better for IITs as compared to the NITs. Thus the difference is the value and ranking of the institutes which is better for IITs as compared to NITs and that's why students who appear in JEE Main keep their targets at IITs and strive to qualify both JEE main and Advanced.
