Basically all non-essential businesses and schools and public buildings and even many public parks and recreation areas have been closed. Almost everyone is working from home.

Only half the people in my state of Michigan are actually practicing social distancing and some of our states have not yet told people to stay home. That\u2019s why so many people are sick and we have no equipment. The great American industrial might has not been brought to bear on this war. It\u2019s getting late. ",
