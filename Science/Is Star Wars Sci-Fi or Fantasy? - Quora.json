            "answer_text": "The conventional answer to this question is that Star Wars is fantasy - \u201cscience fantasy\u201d is the term that is usually used. I\u2019ve stopped calling it that, personally, in favor of calling it \u201cspace opera.\u201d Your mileage may vary, but I feel like too often when I say \u201cscience fantasy\u201d people think \u201clike Tolkien, but with science fiction trappings.\u201d As Dirk Hooper correctly points out, Star Wars is fantasy - but in the vein of Burroughs, not of Tolkien. Star Wars has its influences from Tolkien, insofar as Tolkien has influenced pretty much all western imaginative fiction, but Tolkien isn\u2019t really in its DNA. His influence is pretty tenuous and far removed. Tolkien believed in worldbuilding to an almost fanatical degree. One could almost say he was not even especially interested in telling stories - that he told stories to elucidate the universe he had created rather than to tell the stories for their own sake. Tolkien was also fanatically obsessed with technical detail. He wasn\u2019t obsessed with all technical detail, but the technical things he cared about were cared about in exhaustive detail. He didn\u2019t invent thousands of years of martial arts for his world, for instance\u2026 but he did invent thousands of years of languages, complete with dialectical branches, vowel shifts, and other philological nerdery \u2026 all so he could write a total of a few pages in foreign languages in a work of thousands of pages of English. Star Wars isn\u2019t like that, and never has been. Star Wars doesn\u2019t care about relating every little character to half a dozen other little characters. It didn\u2019t create the universe first and fill in the stories later, and still doesn\u2019t. It cares more about the stories it tells than the world they occur in. It fills in technical detail haphazardly or not at all. Dave Filoni was once asked at a panel how one should prepare for a career in making Star Wars stories. He gave two pieces of advice. The first was what you must not do: obsessively consume and mentally catalogue every piece of Star Wars that\u2019s ever been published. Being a walking, talking Star Wars encyclopedia does not prepare you to tell stories in the Star Wars universe. Two, what you should do: watch classic films. Watch the TV serials and foreign films and American classics that a movie nerd born in the 1940s who went to film school in the 1960s would have been obsessed with. That\u2019s how you prepare for telling Star Wars stories. Star Wars is fantasy only (\u201conly\u201d) in the sense that it is fantastical - larger than life. If you think of it as a space descendant of Tolkien you\u2019re forever going to be misinterpreting it. ",

            "answer_text": " I\u2019m going to answer the question of whether Star Wars is science fiction or fantasy definitively. Star Wars is a fantasy set in space. What I could point to is the Force, which is clearly magic. Sure, you could argue that it\u2019s \u201cthe power of the mind\u201d and Jedis use telekinesis, and telepathy, and so on, which is science fiction, but they also forecast the future, talk to the dead, visit evil caves, and \u201cfeel\u201d each other\u2026 that\u2019s fantasy. I could point to the fact that, in the Star Wars movies, there is never any attempt to explain how anything works, at all. Why is there sound in space? Fantasy. How do lightsabers work? Fantasy. How does Yoda go from being crippled to doing back-flips? Fantasy. How do you stop a blaster bolt in mid air? Fantasy. How does the baddest bounty hunter in the galaxy get foiled accidentally by a blind man? Well, being completely oblivious that the character you created had become a much bigger deal to fans than you realize, and\u2014Fantasy. Science is completely absent from the Star Wars universe. Everything that happens in Star Wars happens because it\u2019s cool. And that\u2019s fantasy. Oh sure, there\u2019s one exception to that rule, and it\u2019s midi-chlorians, which goes against everything that Lucas himself established in order to affect social change. Introducing midi-chlorians was a mistake because Star Wars is a fantasy. I talk a lot more about that here: Dirk Hooper's answer to Why are most Star Wars fans so vehemently opposed to the idea of midichlorians? We could also look at Star Wars from a dispassionate distance. There are knights, and princesses, and wizards. A farm boy leaves to save the princess from the evil Lord\u2019s castle. Along the way there are sword-fights, and rope-swings across chasms, and weird creatures, and adventure. This guy\u2026  Is basically this guy!  I'm sure there are still plenty of people who are sceptical but I\u2019m going to defer to no less than Star Wars creator George Lucas to put this whole silly thing to bed FOREVER. Here, speaking about Star Wars in his own words, is George Lucas talking to Rolling Stone magazine in 1977, \u201cWell, I had a real problem because I was afraid that science-fiction buffs and everybody would say things like, \"You know there's no sound in outer space\". I just wanted to forget science. That would take care of itself. Stanley Kubrick made the ultimate science-fiction movie and it is going to be very hard for somebody to come along and make a better movie, as far as I'm concerned. I didn't want to make a 2001, I wanted to make a space fantasy that was more in the genre of Edgar Rice Burroughs; that whole other end of space fantasy that was there before science took it over in the Fifties. Once the atomic bomb came, everybody got into monsters and science and what would happen with this and what would happen with that. I think speculative fiction is very valid but they forgot the fairy tales and the dragons and Tolkien and all the real heroes.\u201d George Lucas: The Wizard of 'Star Wars' Cue the John Williams music. Star Wars is and always has been a fantasy tale. ",
