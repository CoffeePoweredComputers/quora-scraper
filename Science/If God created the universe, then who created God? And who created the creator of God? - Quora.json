            "answer_text": "First you have to understand where this concept came from, as it has only existed for a few thousand years and records of civilizations go back many many times more years than that. In the primal days we grasped at theory\u2019s to explain our world as we do now. One such theory they came up with with their limited perception and prehistoric intelligence is that there is always a beginning and an end. Pah, Infinity is not a concept most humans are capable of grasping even today! Another prehistoric law of nature is that nothing exists without being created, which to them with their limited perceptions was easily proven. For an animal was created through fornication, not thin air, plants from seeds, pots by humans, et cetera. In actuality; as we now know; these things only cause the process to start and that which makes up the whole is taken from the environment around the entity, animals eat plants and other animals while plants eat the stuff in the soil and pots are made from the stuff in the soil and all things go back to the soil. The hypothesis that there is a beginning and an end is obviously disproven by this law, because if it were true then there would have been a time when nothing existed and something had to create it. In your statement God is defined as a thing which by definition can and did always exist. Therefore they imagined a thing that by definition defies nature (is not limited in any way by it) something outside of it that we cannot imagine so that it can be the ultimate originator of all things so that their clearly disproven hypothesis can be maintained as a theory. We now know that matter cannot be created or destroyed, there is no beginning nor end for anything it is all simply matter changing forms. If that is true (which has been proven) then there is no beginning to existence. Existence; the multiverse; is infinite, matter always existed and always will exist. Therefore there can be no creator of existence, although like a man creating a pot there was something that started the process that created our universe. Another concept difficult for people to understand is natural cause and effect, as opposed to intelligent design. With their limited perceptions people have thought that because they are aware of their actions and making choices that the pot, the hut, et cetera is an intelligent design. Because we think this way, everything must be in this way, for they cannot imagine anything existing in another way than it does in their own perception. Is a hurricane created by the evaporation of hot air rising in the atmosphere (which has been proven) or because God made it appear to punish the wicked Floridians? Volcanos, earthquakes, tornados, et cetera we now know how they come into being naturally, but we once thought it happened magically at God (or the gods) whim. But the truth is our choices are no different from waters choice to erode a cliffside. We are of nature, our molecules form a particular pattern which forms us in a particular way. We are a much more complex series of molecules than water or acid, more than even the processes that create the horrors of nature, but we are still of nature and interact with it in the way our molecular alignment dictates. Everything is natural cause and effect, nothing is created through intelligent design. So if this god is real, and he did intentionally cause the creation of our universe to begin, he is a being of this existence (though perhaps vastly more complex than we can imagine) and interacted with it in a natural way to produce the outcome of the birth of a universe in one of the ways universes continue to bang into being and crunch out of being (though the matter is really just changing form). We humans have worshiped (were thankful for) the sun, the moon, the north star, the Earth itself, and this made sense because we didn\u2019t even realize outer space existed (there was also a time we didnt even realize the planet existed) and only perceived what happened within visual range as existing. We can now see distant planets, we understand outer space\u2019s existence, so worshipping something so small and familiar seems primitive. So it seems we now worship whatever natural phenomenon caused the big bang of our universe, and of course as we did with the sun (Ra, Sol, etc), our planet (Gaia, Terra, etc), the moon (Selene, Luna, etc), and the north star (Lucifer, Tou Mu, etc) we have personified it (as we personify everything, with our limited ability to imagine things other than ourselves existing) and associated a philosophy with it. As the creator of our universe this natural event created all things within it. All other gods are personifications of all these things existing within our universe therefore He created all other gods (angels, demons, etc) before us. The reality lines up with the train of thought (diluted with personification though it may be) explained by religion. ",

            "answer_text": "Humans created it. Here are some related evidence: Some of the evidence of man-made religions are below(just read no. 2, 3,10,11,12 if it's too long): The TRUTH behind some major religions, and don't miss the last paragraph that explains it all: ********************CAUTION****************** Christians should not read unless you are open minded. You may lose faith with your religion. I copy my answer below which I answered questions on why I don't convert to Christianity and The TRUTH behind some major religions. ********************CAUTION****************** 1) Jesus similarities with Buddha. Maya to Mary, miracle pregnancy to virgin pregnancy, birth during a journey home to from home, prophesied soon after birth, both had a disciple who betrayed them, walked on water, Gautama left the palace at age 29 and Jesus appeared at 29, Gautama became Buddha at 35 and Jesus died and resurrected at around 35 too, after they passed away, 500 arahants witnessed compilation of Buddha's teachings and over 500 witnesses to Jesus's resurrection etc. All coincidental ? Beside Buddha, Jesus also copied from Horus and Mithra. Surely they ALL cannot be coincidental. 2) Many of the Bible's mythologies was copied from older pagans, Greek, Egyptian or Hinduism religions(note the names too) E.g. Adam & Eve story similar to Atman and Jeewa, a pair of birds in Hinduism, big flood and survivor Noah/3 sons same as Manu/3 sons although cause of flood is different. Even the names of Abraham and wife/sister Sarah close to Brahma and Saraswathi beside having similar story. Regardless of which religion copied which, it proved this god is NOT the only true god or all mighty as it doesn't makes sense to create or allow more copies or religions. 3) Why a true all mighty, all knowing and only god allowed their people to branch off and kill their parent religion Judaism ? This alone is enough proof that their God is non-existant. \"Free will\" as an excuse is not acceptable as earlier they claimed their God killed all people with a big flood(without freewill) because they sinned. 4) The Bible condemned non-followers, clearly mentioned in Mark's words. Why should a Creator God's religion condemn non-believers when in the first place, they claimed their God created the world? Isn't this like playing both sides of the same coin, both good and evil ? 5)Not knowing why or how the world exists don't mean that it was created by a god. Now \"Creator\" got stale, they use \"Intelligent Design\" What is so intelligent in its design? If people don't need to go to toilet and don't have unpleasant feelings and sufferings, then I will call it an intelligent design. 6)Wisdom and meditation are not taught by them. Is it because they know meditation can make a person's mind clearer and wiser? 7)The Bible copied so much from older religions but why don't they copy the theory of karma too? Is it because karma debunk the idea of an all mighty God or is it because karma belief may prevent people from doing bad deeds ? 8) The way the church preached and claimed simply lacked substance and logic. If you ask them intelligent question, they will always be evasive and say you are not serious or an evil. 9) It don't makes sense to claim that only their believers will go to heaven and others don't since they claimed their God created all people. Such claim is an insult to other religions and cultures and caused people to divide. A good religion should be secular and treat all people equally. 10) The way they collect titlings during Sunday mass is so tricky. They know people will be shy not to pay or tend to pay more when others could be watching. This is why they don't just use a stationed money box like Buddhism, Hinduism or Chinese temples where people can donate anytime. Catholics and Islam made it even bigger by suggesting donation of a certain percentage of their income. 11)Most major festivals and holidays related to Christianity and Jesus, including Christmas(Jesus can't be born in winter), Easter, Thanksgiving, Good Friday, All Souls, Halloween and even New Year are copied from paganism which existed long before Judaism. They are similar both in dates and traditions, surely it can't be that coincidental. 12) A true creator god should be the first and only religion. All the pagans, Greek, Chinese, Hinduism religions existed before Abrahamic religions. It proved Judaism is not the first religion but they copied other religions' gods, mythologies and ideas to create their 1 only god concept. 13) Using fear: the afterlife or after death, hell or \"end of the world\" predictions every 2 years are common tricks too. 14) Behavior of their leaders: The case of Mother Teresa and Pope Francis. Catholics used Teresa and made so much money from the Indians but after her death, those money are not returned to the Indians who are poorer than the Vatican. The latest encounter between Dalai Lama and Pope Francis further proved Christianity is more interested with their income instead of world peace. When the Dalai Lama was in Italy and wanted to meet him, Francis turned down because he is afraid of losing income from China. Later, the Pope can travel all the way to Thailand and Japan to hold Catholics events. 15) The way the church used tricks like programs and events to attract the kids and lonely middle-aged people in Asia. Why must they use such tricks ?(this may not be in Western countries). 16) Missionaries only approach those who are alone and not those in a group because loners are always better target in any scam or bad business. If their God is all-mighty, why need missionaries to proselytize? 17) The ongoing child sex abuses committed by the pastors/priests that I read so often. They must have know that their God don't exist. 18) The Bible is full of lust(Sodomon's part), evil and violence. Their God killed countless people when Satan only killed a few. What's the idea behind it if not playing both sides of the same coin? 19) The Bible condemned dogs because they know dogs are man's best friend. Making men lonely is the best way to keep them dependant on religion. Otherwise I can't think of any other possible reason why the Bible must condemn dogs. 20) If God created everybody, then homosexuals are God's creation too. Why then condemn homosexuality ? 21) Incidents, eg: (a) Covid-19 in U.S., Italy, Spain, Brazil, Mexico are all high Christianity populated countries and more people died (b) The Air Asia plane crash of 2014 when 41 church members, 2 missionaries and their few month old baby all died on their way for a Christianity event from Surabaya to Singapore. Could all these 21 points above be coincidental ? Certainly not. Only 1 reason can tie up all 21 points above, that is this God was man-made to con, control or conquer others and gullible people are being victimised. Now, for the sake of world peace, please share and help to make people less ignorant to religions. ",
