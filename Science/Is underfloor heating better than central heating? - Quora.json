            "answer_text": "Cold winter months require for some warmth even if it is just about a warm home. To get a home like this it is entirely important that you choose a get an effectively functioning home heating system \u2013 one that not only ensures the warmth that you need but is also easy to use. The two best options usually available for people are either the central heating system or an underfloor heating system \u2013 while both of these are good at their work there are still some questions surrounding as to which is the one that will work best. Here, we\u2019re answering the same question so you can decide on the one that will be the best for you. Mentioned below are the pros and cons associated with both of these options \u2013 The Central Heating System For anyone who has little information about the central heating system \u2013 it is also referred to as the radiator system and that has been one of the traditional ways of room heating. Pros of Radiator Heating \u00b7 Quick to heat up \u00b7 Easy to use \u00b7 Low-maintenance Cons of Radiator Heating \u00b7 Takes up space \u00b7 Heat rises, so some heat is lost through the ceiling rather than circulating into the room \u00b7 Can look ugly on the wall \u00b7 Can be noisy at times Underfloor Heating System The system for house / room heating wherein the wires are heated only under the floor is a more modern way for heating. Considering that it has become a more common approach it is but important to understand the pros and cons about it, so here are the details associated with it further. Pros of Underfloor Heating \u00b7 Efficient in performance \u00b7 Can be laid in all new and old homes \u00b7 Does not take up any wall space (it can never be seen) \u00b7 Conducts an even distribution of heat in the room unlike radiators that concentrate on just one spot sometimes \u00b7 It is a kind of luxury \u00b7 Does not circulate dust/allergens unlike the central heating systems \u00b7 Operate silently Cons of Underfloor Heating \u00b7 Installation may be expensive compared \u00b7 The effects are not instantaneous; it can take up to two hours to heat a room \u00b7 It may restrict heating up the furniture \u00b7 Maintenance can be tricky at times \u00b7 Won\u2019t help you dry clothes \u2013 you can\u2019t put a towel rail on the floor Even though, honestly I personally believe that radiant heating systems are the very best considering their many benefits, this writeup will help you understand the one that will be the best for you. Additionally, if you are still unsure you can always get in touch with someone that has experience in this field and can provide you the information that you may require about the best heating system for your home.

            "answer_text": "What do you mean by better?If you are referring to the resultant effect of the system on the room or space, then yes, it is far better. Radiators are point sources of heat, usually at high temperatures, that rely on radiation and limited convection to heat a space. They are ugly, hard to clean and hard to place in modern home designs, that have extensive glass use on the external facades and large open plan interiors. Finding a wall long enough is often very difficult! UFH systems turn the entire floor surface into a low temperature radiator.Due to the fact that your heat source is the floor, you get a very natural flow of heat upwards, as the air warms.The effect of warm feet on the human body is also very pleasant and often one can get away with lower ambient air temps, if your feet are warm. By far the best form of UFH is water based UFH. It uses a fraction of the energy that its electrical counterpart uses and you can choose from a variety of technologies to heat the water. We use solar, wood fired boilers, wood pellet boilers, heat pumps, etc, or sometimes combinations of these technologies to efficiently heat the water.These systems can often be combined to also produce hot water for the house and also provide heat for hydronic towel rails in the bathrooms and also pool heating systems. These systems are expensive upfront, but given the long term energy efficiency, we see ROI periods of less than 5 years, when compared to traditional systems being used for the individual services. Water based UFH is very popular in Europe and we see regular advancements in control technology and pumping technology, that make these systems even more efficient. I hope this helps you. ",
