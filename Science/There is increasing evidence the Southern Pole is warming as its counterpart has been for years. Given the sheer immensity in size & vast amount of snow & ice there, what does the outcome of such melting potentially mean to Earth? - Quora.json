            "answer_text": "\u201cAntarctica is covered with ice an average of 2,133 meters (7,000 feet) thick. If all of the Antarctic ice melted, sea levels around the world would rise about 61 meters (200 feet). But the average temperature in Antarctica is -37\u00b0C, so the ice there is in no danger of melting. In fact in most parts of the continent it never gets above freezing.\u201d If the polar ice caps melted, how much would the oceans rise? But if the all of the Antarctic ice somehow melted and oceans rose 200 feet, then all coastal land currently below 200 feet above sea level would be flooded by ocean. Obviously this would take many years (hundreds or even thousands, depending upon how warm the Antarctic climate became. So there would be plenty of time for coastal inhabitants to move inland. Thus, the primary loss would be the $hundreds of billions, if not $trillions worth of buildings, homes, roads, and other structures. There would also be a loss of cropland, forests and animal/plant habitat, although the amount of marine habitat would increase. If Antarctica melted, it is probable that most or all of the other global ice sheets would as well, further raising ocean levels. There would be a slight decrease in overall salinity of the oceans due to the diluting effect of all of the additional fresh water from the melted ice. However, because the salinity change would occur over hundreds or thousands of years, most marine life would likely evolve with the change. However, in order for the temperatures to increase sufficiently to melt Antarctica, the earth would probably suffer even more adverse consequences from this increase, long before Antarctica completely melted. It is difficult, if not impossible, to know exactly what and how severe those consequences would be and how various climate feedback mechanisms would either mitigate or worsen them. So what are the chances that the above scenarios might occur? Certainly ocean levels have been much higher in the ancient past, and much of the various continents were covered. So it is quite possible that similar levels could be reached again. But the how and when is purely speculative. There is currently no proof that such events are imminent or that human emissions of CO2 are the cause, despite all of the claims by catastrophic anthropogenic CO2 global warming alarmists. When correlations between the rate of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and other climate parameters are statistically detrended, the correlations vanish. Detrending eliminates the correlation of  \u2014 atmospheric CO2 concentration and fossil fuel CO2 emissions;  \u2014 ocean CO2 levels and fossil fuel CO2 emissions;  \u2014 rate of global warming and rate of CO2 emissions;  \u2014 rate of sea level rise and rate of CO2 emissions; and  \u2014 rate of Arctic sea ice melt and rate of global warming.Spurious Correlations in Climate Science So if rising levels of CO2 are causing global temps to increase, the CO2 rise is due to natural sources from land, oceans and terrestrial and underwater volcanoes. In addition, new evidence suggests that most of any Antarctic ice melting is due to heating from over 100 volcanoes below the ice. Discovery of Massive Volcanic CO2 Emissions Puts Damper on Global Warming Theory \u2014 Plate climatology But there is also no proof that atmospheric CO2 significantly increases global temperatures. While CO2, H2O and a few other atmospheric gases absorb terrestrial IR radiation, the claim that back-radiation from these cooler gases warms an already warmer earth is just a hypothesis. Obviously some of the most outspoken CAGW alarmists are not worried about rising oceans. Obama and Gore have both purchased multi-million dollar coastal mansions. Obama\u2019s is only about 10 feet above sea level. https://www.quora.com/Will-Obamas-new-house-be-threatened-by-the-rise-of-the-oceans-caused-by-global-warming/answer/John-Flavin-1 But, even if the enormous rise in ocean levels does occur in the distant future, there is nothing that we can do about it at this time. The chance of this is probably on the same order as a massive asteroid strike and less than a massive pandemic or global thermonuclear war. There\u2019s plenty to worry about if one is so inclined.

            "answer_text": "If the whole lot goes the least you can expect is many low lying places will be under water. NY, NO and all the gulf coast, Florida will not have to worry about sink holes, there will be no Florida. Sea level increase of at least 30 feet. Probably much more. Countries like Bangladesh, Nederlands, Belgium, Denmark, coastal france, coastal UK (not the cliff side areas), low lying Island nations eg The Maldives, will vanish. Venice, what Venice? Loads of areas around the Med will vanish. The main problem will be the load of extra, cold, fresh, water will screw the ocean currents to a great extent. A lot of Europe will loose the warmish waters of the North Atlantic Drift, wrongly referred to as The Gulf Stream. The loss of the Gulf Stream which dives deep off the US East Coast pulling freshly oxygenated water to prime wild life territory will cause havoc. It is warm water above this that goes across to Europe. The overall temp of the world will drop. But before that the weather will get \u201cvery interesting\u201d. To put it simply, millions if not billions of displaced people, loss of fish stocks, loss of land for farming, climate change in a large way. Population crash, wars for food and living space, Nuclear power stations flooded, docks gone, rivers flooding due to sea level increase, CO2 release by the shed load as permafrost thaws. And without a doubt many more problems. It is going to take a while, but the problem is that it is a problem of positive feedback. The more ice melts, the warmer the Earth gets, the warmer the Earth gets, the more the ice melts. Repeat till you run out of ice. But the other problem is that even if we did a lot now, too reduce the effects, it is still going to get worse before it starts to get better. The Earth is a big place and like big ships, it takes a lot pf time to stop and reverse. ",
