            "answer_text": "Why did the Pope say he supports same-sex unions? Because he knows he\u2019s fighting an unpopular and losing battle. But he\u2019s smart enough to know when to choose his battles. Any state, any country, any non-Catholic religion can endorse, support, and allow same-sex unions and marriages. By supporting something over which he has no control anyway, he gives the appearance of being \u201cgenerous\u201d and \u201cenlightened\u201d. The fact is that he cannot stop same-sex unions OR marriages - he can only control what CATHOLICS do within their religion. ",

Contrary to what the lunatic fringe of the right says, it's not abandoning the traditional teaching on sex. And contrary to what the lunatic fringe of the left says, moral disapproval is neither hate nor a \"phobia.\u201d ",
