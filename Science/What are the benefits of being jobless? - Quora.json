            "answer_text": "You should feel thankful that you have an opportunity being jobless (if that\u2019s the case). It's time to come out of robotic mechanical routine and do something different and new. It's time to reboot your memory and thinking process and start afresh. Plan your day in a way that you would be spending a limited amount only And try to accommodate your needs within that amount. You would learn that it is possible to live with bare minimum necessities too. Take a break. Being Jobless gives you an opportunity to travel places but try to voyage with minimum possible expenditures. Believe me it's possible!! Relationships are always ignored or taken for granted when one thinks of success, career and earning money. It's your time to value meaningful relationships in your life and see the kind of rewards that you get by nurturing them. I know earnings anyways are required to sustain livelihood. Start looking for earning money with your hobbies. The things that you once thought of but could never do, it's time to do all that now. Explore current trends of earning money instead of traditional ways of doing a job and picking up a salary. At last, remember, jobs are meant for earnings and gaining work satisfaction in life. Both can be achieved without job too. It all depends how you perceive. Good luck!! ",
