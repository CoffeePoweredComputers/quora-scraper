            "answer_text": "The list which I am providing is not based on ranking, it is just a list of labs and universities in Europe . For PhD research the lab matters more than the university. Some of the best labs in Europe which are very good for computer science are 1) ETH-Zurich -  has a very good computer science PhD programme 2)Max planck institute for informatics - international max planck research school is one the top most labs which does cutting research in Computer science. Though they do not grant the PhD degree(the degree is granted by the affiliated German university) ,  as a PhD student at most of the German universities,  you can have the opportunity to do your research there. 3) Inria -  the French is top class in research as well with outstanding researchers and scientists. Similar to max planck,  Inria doesn't grant the PhD degree but the affiliated university grants the degree though you will be doing the PhD research at Inria. Every year they recruit PhD students and the applications are available on their website. 4) university of Cambridge - do I need to say more about this ;) 5)university of Oxford 6) EPFL -  this Swiss university is also up there in terms of ranking  There are other good universities as well such as University college London, imperial college, University of Edinburgh. But more than these you need to look a the specific labs at the universities and the research alignment  of the labs with your interests. Edit 1 : some more to the list areTU-Munich, University of Copenhagen, Saarland university, RWTH-aachen.  I can keep adding,  but as I said before,  for PhD,  research fit matters more than the university. ",
