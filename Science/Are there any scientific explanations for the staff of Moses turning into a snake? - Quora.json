            "answer_text": "I think you probably already knew the answer before you posted the question. If you knew any science and how it actually operates and on what, you\u2019d know that there can be no scientific explanation of the wooden staff turning into a snake. This is not just a case of finding it difficult to scientifically explain a natural phenomenon. This phenomenon described in the Bible is a miracle. Science does not deal with miracles. Besides, how do you differentiate a miracle from phenomena in the natural world? Some people ( - including me -) do not accept there is such a thing as miracles. The so called miracles are made-up stories intended to impress. ",

            "answer_text": "There are I believe certain snakes that exhibit tonic immobility if handled appropriately, a conjurers trick that may have been well known to the mythical moses and to the court magi,the act of casting the \u2018staves\u2019 to the floor would shock the snakes from their torpor.Any conjurer worth his salt would be familiar with every trick in the book. I recall seeing video of a snake handler at Giza perform such miracle with a cobra of some type, after some manipulation of the snake he was able to tie the critter in knots and it remained rigid and immobile until tapped with the palm of his hand.
