            "answer_text": "For a material to be transparent, it must not block the light by reflection, by scattering, or by absorption. If any of these processes are too great, we will perceive the material as opaque or perhaps translucent. In materials that have a high density of electrons that are free to move, the movement of those electrons will absorb the energy and re-emit it\u2014 mostly not in the direction it was originally going. These materials can look very shiny, but what isn\u2019t re-emitted is quickly absorbed, so these materials are nearly perfectly opaque, even for quite thin layers. If a material has many changes in density (as paper does) or has a very rough surface (as frosted glass does), then light will be refracted or reflected in random directions, so even if the reflection is not terribly strong, no image will pass through. If the scattering layer is thin, we will see light pass through. However, if enough layers of scattering are present, eventually the material becomes effectively impassable to light, rendering it opaque. Though light is almost never absorbed, to pass through, light would have to be lucky in scattering in the forward direction so many times, that it becomes very unlikely. An example of this would be what you would see underneath 100 feet of snow. Snow absorbs almost no light at all, but because of the many, many layers of scattering between you and the source of light, you will be in near total darkness under 100 feet. Some molecules have specific electronic transitions that can be excited, thus \u201cstealing\u201d a photon of light. If the density of these molecules is high, and if there are enough transitions to absorb all the different colors of light present, then without reflection or scattering, the material can appear opaque. Cobalt blue glass is opaque to red and orange wavelengths because of this kind of molecular absorption. ",

            "answer_text": "Materials are transparent to those wavelengths of light for which there is no mechanism within the material to absorb those wavelengths. Glass (silicon dioxide), for example, can absorb light both in the infrared and the ultraviolet wavelength ranges for two entirely different reasons. (Infrared radiation can stimulate mechanical vibrations in the molecular bonds of the material - hence is absorbed while raising its temperature a bit. Ultraviolet radiation is energetic enough to free some electrons from the molecular bonds - thus is absorbed making the material more electrically conductive.) But in the range between infrared and ultraviolet radiation - that is, in visible range, neither atomic vibrations nor electron transitions are stimulated, so those wavelengths are transmitted and we say the material is transparent. Other solids, metals for example, already have free electrons near the surface of the metal which readily absorb the energy of a wide range of wavelengths, so metals are not transparent. Some others, such as semiconducting silicon are similar to glass in that some wavelengths are absorbed and some are transmitted. In silicon, even infrared wavelengths near the visible are energetic enough to free electrons from the covalent bonds that hold the material together - so even shorter wavelengths (the visible spectrum) are also absorbed. But silicon is transparent to longer wavelength infrared radiation that is not energetic enough to stimulate those electron transitions within the material. When radiation is energetic enough to free electrons from the molecular bonds of the material, we say that the radiation energy is greater than the energy bandgap between the valence and conduction bands of the material, and electrons are promoted to the conduction band making the material more electrically conductive. That is the jargon of semiconductor physics and engineering. Silicon has a smaller bandgap than does silicon dioxide (glass) - so lower energy photons can promote those electron transitions, hence the material is not transparent to those visible wavelengths. Glass has a larger energy bandgap, hence requires more energetic photons (i.e., shorter wavelength radiation) to free those electrons, so is transparent to visible light. Diamond has a much larger bandgap yet, and hence is transparent to an even broader range of wavelengths of light. Probably a more detailed answer than was asked for (or maybe even necessary), but it might interest some. ",
