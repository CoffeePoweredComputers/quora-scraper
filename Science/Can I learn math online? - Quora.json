            "answer_text": "It\u2019s certainly possible (sites like Khan Academy wouldn\u2019t be a bad start), but it will be much more difficult. The general problem with online learning is the lack of interaction with an instructor, and the instructors inability to adjust the material or explanation for the student. I\u2019ve taken a staggering number of math courses in my life, and yes many of them I probably could have managed in an online format. But there\u2019s that one concept, that one trick, that you need to grasp but can\u2019t quite manage to get your mental hands around. Until you talk it out with the professor, they might point out a fundamental error you\u2019re making (multiplication isn\u2019t necessarily commutative for groups) or an alternate way of viewing something (real-valued polynomials will follow one of two patterns as the tend towards both infinities).
