            "answer_text": "A short answer would be that motion is neither relative nor absolute. The movement is a concept that designates the transcendent manifestation of existence in conjunction with transformation. \"Motion\" is a term that designates kinematic activity, while the movement designates a dynamic activity. Relative and absolute notions are at other levels of complexity than movement or motion, but also relative to each other. I don\u2019t think you know what you ask, just as Ali Abdulla, with all the respect for his scientific work, does not understand for himself what he has answered, as long as he thinks motion means speed.

            "answer_text": "All the velocities are relative and no one can say I am standing and you are moving unless you elect one reference frame as absolute (false assumption, but useful for our practical purposes). There is only one velocity which is the same in all the reference frames. It is the speed of light. Whatever is the reference frame you are in you will always measure that its speed is always about 3*10^8 m/s Thus the speed of light can be considered the only absolute speed. It is the only pivot we can count on. ",
