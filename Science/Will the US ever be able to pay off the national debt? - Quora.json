            "answer_text": "The debt will not be paid off, because voters will not elect politicians who will raise taxes and cut expenditures. Certainly nobody alive today will live to see the debt go to zero, but that may be okay. For reasons I am not smart enough to understand, but Alexander Hamilton was, it's not a bad thing for a country to have a debt. The question is the size of the debt. Of course our country grows, and the value of the dollar fluctuates, so it makes sense to consider the question using the unit \"percentage of the gross national product\". In other words, how does our total debt compare to all the money we make in a year? (If you make $50k, you can pay off $50k in credit card bills in a single year, assuming you keep working, but stand in the rain all night, wear the same clothes for a year, and forage for berries.) Here's a chart that shows our total outstanding debt at the end of the year as a percentage of the gross national product that year. Let's not argue about the blue and red stripes. Congress and the normal business cycle have more to do with deficits than the President.  Many readers know this very well, but for completeness, lets be sure we're talking about the same thing. The national debt is the total debt owed. It's complex, because some of it is owed to the Social Security trust fund and some say we shouldn't worry about debts we owe ourselves, since we can just print money. Others tend to turn white and faint when they hear that kind of talk. But anyway, the debt is the total outstanding. The deficit is the annual difference between income and expenses. It's equally mind-bogglingly complex, because some items are things you can just plan to spend and then spend precisely that much, but with others, like, say, food aid, you don't know what the total will be until the year is over, since you can't predict with certainty what will happen to the economy. Ideally, you might have a fairly steady debt that hovers around a particular percentage of the gross national product. The actual percentage isn't as important as the concept that we ought to agree on what that number is. Each year, if we run a deficit in the annual budget, the debt increases. If we run a surplus, the debt goes down. The debt we have now is not without precedent. We had a similar debt that we ran up in World War II, as the chart shows. But we ran surpluses in our budgets quite often until the early seventies, and we largely paid it down. Then it started going up again, and it's back up to something pretty close to 100% of the GDP. There are so many ways that a country's finances aren't like your finances, even beyond the complexity. But to pay down the debt, we obviously have to find a way to collect more taxes than we spend. It hasn't been trending that way recently. Republicans decry spending, but promise low taxes, and they deliver. Democrats decry taxes that are too low at the upper brackets, but promise lots of benefits, and they deliver. The resulting compromise (or witches brew, if you will), is the combination of low taxes and high benefits, which obviously creates a debt. To pay down that debt, future taxpayers will have to pay more of their paychecks to the government, and they have to get less in return. Sort of a raw deal we're handing our kids and their grandkids. We think we're being generous by helping today's poor, but we're not paying for it. We're borrowing the money from future generations. Not cool. ",

            "answer_text": "NO! Not if \u201cTAX REFORM\" of the type promised by Xmas recess becomes the standard over the next eight to twelve years. The Reagan gimmick to justify his doubling of tripling the national debt\u2026 and subsequent doubling by Bush & Bush \u2026 was that the debt would be \u201cMONETIZED\" meaning inflation would DEVALUE the fixed dollar debr. Republicans promised a Ponzi Scheme fraud against its citizens and the world. Those who remember the 1980\u2032s might recall the exceptionally high interest on U.S. Treasuries during the Reagan era. That was part of the con, and was accompanied by the runaway increase in the value of gold and silver. (Earier removable of Constitutionally mandated gold standard behind dollar as equal to one twentieth of an ounce of gold, was an earlier con.) But when inflation dropped to normal levels of 3% and kept falling \u2014 so mortgage rates fell from post-war 8% to current 4% \u2014 the bottom fell out of the con. But Republicans are still running that con!!!! We had a taste of their game with the Great Recession. And only a global Great Depression, that makes the 1929 DEPRESSION look like a mild recession, can clear the decks \u2014 if we keep letting the debt increase, while refusing income to balance the budget through taxation on wealthy, while also refusing to rein in the military budget because we insist on being global cops, the bottom drops out in mid 2030\u2032s. Japan is a model for the economic stress of an aging population. To ensure the collapse, Republicans have suppressed the minimum wage and Social Security to keep the bulk of society on public assistance. They even started training their base to call paid for Social Security a form of welfare, so, when the bottom falls out, they can blame the lazy bums on welfare. Comically, if a novelist were writing a apocalyptic saga set in a wartime 3035/40, or. A post-war 2050 or 2100, they could use the plot element of the Russians having decided the COLD WAR was pointless, and th post-Cuban Missile Crisis world too dangerous, so they planted agents to enter the political financial sector and create economic collapse. The Russian economy, thanks to the Stalin era, was structured to be immune from a global depression that would consume the Western powers. China, free of Western suppression instituted in 1880/90\u2032s, and with a third of global population within its boarders, could self-sustain a growing economy (providing it already has the most modern technology and was free from dependence on Middle Eastern oil). As for the Middle East, properly manipulated, their RELIGION allows them to become a surrogate army attacking the West as it collapses. So HAVE FUN KIDS, YOU ARE LIVING THROUGH THE PLOTLINE OF A CONSOIRACY NOVEL. AND THE DEBT WILL CAUSE THE NATION TO GO BANKRUPT BECAUSE RUSSIAN AGENTS TOOK OVER probably during Nixon era, and certainly to bring a demented Ronald Reagan into power. ",
