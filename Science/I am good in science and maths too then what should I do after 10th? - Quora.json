            "answer_text": "Believe in what you are and in what you are comfortable with. Passion for a subject does not mean getting good grades, it means you enjoy it. After class 10 you have to devote maximum time to minimum subjects that you will chose. If you are passionate about science stream then go for it. But if you feel that you are more comfortable with some other subject(s) or you love that other subject(s) more than science subjects go with your fresh opinion. It will motivate you to study furthur and will help you to climb high. Wishing u all the best! ",
