            "answer_text": "For any changes to occur there must be some driving force. For the flow of heat, there must be a temperature difference or temperature driving force or a difference in enthalpy. For a fluid to flow there must be some mechanical energy difference like pressure difference, or height or head difference. For the mass transfer to occur there must be a chemical potential difference between the two points we may say the concentration difference but its really the chemical potential difference. This happens in electricity also. So for every change, there is a driving force, so what will be the driving force for a chemical change or a chemical reaction. According to thermodynamics for any changes to be possible it must be spontaneous. In general, the spontaneity of a process only determines whether or not a process can occur and makes no indication as to whether or not the process will occur. In other words, spontaneity is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a process to actually occur. Furthermore, spontaneity makes no implication as to the speed at which spontaneous may occur. As an example, the conversion of a diamond into graphite is a spontaneous process at room temperature and pressure. Despite being spontaneous, this process does not occur since the energy to break the strong carbon-carbon bonds is larger than the release in free energy. But how can we measure spontaneity? For a process that occurs at constant temperature and pressure, spontaneity can be determined using the change in Gibbs free energy, which is given by: \u0394G =\u0394H - T\u0394S where the sign of \u0394G depends on the signs of the changes in enthalpy (\u0394H) and entropy (\u0394S). The sign of \u0394G will change from positive to negative (or vice versa) where T = \u0394H/\u0394S. In cases where \u0394G is: negative, the process is spontaneous and may proceed in the forward direction as written.positive, the process is non-spontaneous as written, but it may proceed spontaneously in the reverse direction.zero, the process is at equilibrium, with no net change taking place over time.So the Gibbs free energy depends on changes in enthalpy(\u0394H) and entropy (\u0394S). When \u0394S > 0 and \u0394H < 0, the process is always spontaneous as written.When \u0394S < 0 and \u0394H > 0, the process is never spontaneous, but the reverse process is always spontaneous.When \u0394S > 0 and \u0394H > 0, the process will be spontaneous at high temperatures and non-spontaneous at low temperatures.When \u0394S < 0 and \u0394H < 0, the process will be spontaneous at low temperatures and non-spontaneous at high temperatures.For the latter two cases, the temperature at which the spontaneity changes will be determined by the relative magnitudes of \u0394S and \u0394H. So simply we can say the driving forces for a chemical reaction are: 1. Enthalpy change (Depends on bond breaking and forming ) If it's negative, we call it exothermic reaction the result is less energy, more stable product because what was made has lost energy into the surroundings. This is the case if the interactions formed are stronger than the interactions broken. This is thermodynamically favorable.  But the opposite case that is \u0394H > 0 is also happening. Not only exothermic reactions are happening in nature but endothermic is also occurring, this is due to the condition 3 of the Gibbs free energy change to be negative at when \u0394S > 0 and \u0394H > 0, the process will be spontaneous at high temperatures and non-spontaneous at low temperatures.  2. Entropy The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Such systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy increases. Entropy is a function of the state of the system, so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is reversible, the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy. If it's positive, the energy in the system disperses out into the surroundings. An analogy is that if we are talking about ideal gas particles, the particles spread out more. When both cases are satisfied, i.e. if the change in enthalpy is negative and the change in entropy is positive, the reaction is said to be spontaneous, and thus, enthalpy and entropy are the two driving thermodynamic forces of chemical reactions.
