            "answer_text": "Good question! Allow me to suggest a different way to phase your question, though: \u201cWhy do atoms absorb some photon frequencies?\u201d The electromagnetic spectrum is huge, and the vast majority of photons from this broader spectrum do not interact with individual atoms much at all. But why? If you happen to be near a piano in a room that is very quiet and where it\u2019s OK to do this, I want you to try a little experiment: Get as close as you can to the board where all the piano wires are, e.g. by opening up the top of the piano (again, only if you can), then sing some note loudly. It doesn\u2019t matter what note. Now stop, abruptly, and listen! Do you hear your own note playing back to you? You should, on almost any piano. (This would also work for a harp, and might even work for a guitar; I\u2019ve never tried.) The piano absorbed the sound vibrations that you were emitting, which by the way are called phonons in quantum mechanics. (Yes, even ordinary sound is quantum mechanical in its deeper nature.) The piano then emitted the very same frequencies of sound, using the stored-up energy it had received from you But notice carefully: The only sounds you heard back were the ones you emitted. That means that the only strings that \u201cheard\u201d you singing were the ones tuned to exactly the note you were emitting. The other strings in the piano literally could not \u201chear\u201d your singing, at least not very well, because they had no ways to store up that particular kind of vibration. The only strings that could were the once for which each passing pulse of sound would cause the string to move in the same direction, every time, allowing those motions (and their energy) to add up. This reinforcing effect is generically called a resonance. That in a nutshell is why most photons just sail right by most atoms: The atoms are just not \u201ctuned right\u201d to collect much energy from them \u2014 and in the quantum world, \u201cnot much\u201d doesn\u2019t count, because photons are quantized and can only be absorbed whole. This means they are even more resistant to \u201chearing\u201d out-of-tune vibrations than your piano was. But in other cases an atom or molecules has electrons that are beautifully resonant with particular photon frequencies, such as that doublet of yellow resonances for vaporized sodium. These resonances tend to be particularly strong when elemental atoms are in their ionized vapor (plasma) state. Picking up photons gets easier in solid matter, where electrons spread across so many atoms can exist in a much broader range of energy states. This is where you get behaviors like carbon black, which can accept any optical photon very well, or new engineered materials designed to absorb light as well or better than carbon black.  So, the bottom line: An atom will in general be transparent to all ordinary-energy photons, unless they contain some kind of \u201cresonance mode\u201d that allows them to absorb that particular frequency of light well. Higher energy photons in the X-ray and gamma range can interact directly with electrons, paying little attention to atomic structure, so those more complicated to analyze.) ",

            "answer_text": "An incoming photon in a gas must match the energy gap between one electron\u2019s positions and the next highest slot or it will not be absorbed. The probability of being absorbed is a coupling constant, a number between 0 and 1. For a cold atom, the coupling constant is maximum only at a very narrow range of photon energies (wavelengths). This bandwidth expands as the thermal motion increases (the stuff gets hotter). In a metal, all photons are either absorbed or reflected. In other solids a broad range of photons is absorbed as thermal energy (heat). ",
