            "answer_text": "IBM made a little movie five years ago, using atoms to build figures and letters on a substrate of a different element. The atoms were shoved around stop-action-style by a scanning tunneling electron microscope to create the movement. (Actually they moved entire carbon monoxide molecules, but the visible bright dots are the oxygen atoms, according to reports. The surface was copper.) The waves seen in the copper surface have been described by some sources as quantum probability waves. But that makes me wonder, what is the scope detecting inasmuch as probability is not a substance. Also, some recent books say flatly that quantum probability functions are just mathematical objects with no physical form. So are those just the shapes of copper atoms, perhaps being tossed around by the CO molecules? What do I know? Well, \u201cI no nuttin!\u201d like the German sergeant Schultz in \u201cHogan\u2019s Heroes,\u201d It would be nice if one of Quora\u2019s bona-fide physicists would clarify this point.

            "answer_text": "In the UK, they actually have a microscope called the Nion Hermes Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope. It costs about $4.8 million and can image objects a million times smaller than a human hair. This is sufficient to see a single atom or atomic columns. Electron microscopes use a beam of electrons rather than photons, as you'd find in a regular light microscope. As electrons have a much shorter wavelength than photons, you can get much greater magnification and better resolution. For example, here is a picture of a pure graphene sheet:  Even though this next one is not from the same microscope, in the photo, a single atom of strontium is held almost perfectly still by an electrical field generated by a pair of electrodes. A laser excites and illuminates the atom, which shines like a tiny speck of dust caught in the glare of the sun. Still, you probably have to squint to see it.  zoomed in:  ",
