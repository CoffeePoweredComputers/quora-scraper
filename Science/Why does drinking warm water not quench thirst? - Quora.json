            "answer_text": "It does. Thirst is just the body's natural response to being dehydrated. Water of almost any temperature will satisfy that need. Perhaps you are confusing thirst with feeling too hot. Naturally, warm water is not as refreshing and therefore does not help to lower your body temperature as much as cool water, but that is a different issue. If you were dying of thirst in the desert and came across a canteen of hot water lying in the sun, you would be happy to drink it and I can guarantee you'd be much less thirsty as a result. ",

            "answer_text": "I personally think it has something to do with the temperature inside your body. When you drink warm water that is slightly warmer than ur body\u2019s temp your body will try to cool it down, but then this will raise your body\u2019s temp so your body needs to cool down by excreting sweat or any other way to cool your body down, which in turn would cause you to lose some moisture, hence you are less quenched as when you drink cold/colder water.But again this is just my opinion not a scientific statement.
