            "answer_text": "The answer provided by Mr. Xu is essentially correct in theory but is incomplete. There is a subtle and hidden physical consideration in this question that his answers ignores. The WEIGHT (w) of the object will actually make a DIFFERENCE in the determination of the NET FORCE. Case I: the two forces are in the same direction, along (+ x). The NET force is 20 N along (+ x). Case II: The two forces are in OPPOSITE direction along x-axis. The NET force is ZERO. Case III: the two forces are in the same direction along (- x). The NET force is (- 20 N). Case IV: The two forces are in the (+ y) direction. The NET force is: [(20 - w) N]. Case V: The two forces are in the (- y) direction. The NET force is: [(20 + w) N]. Case VI: one force is in the (+ y) and the other is in (- y). The Net force is (w). In all other cases, we must break down the two 10 N forces into (x & y) components and find SIGMA FORCE, as Mr. Xu suggests. ",

            "answer_text": "The net force force acting on the crate depends on the direction of the two forces and the amount of friction acting on the crate. The resultant vector is the vector sum of the 3 forces involved. If the boy and the girl are acting in the same direction, their combined forces is 20 newtons. If the force of friction is 8 newtons opposing their combined forces then the net force acting on the object is (20 N - 8 N) which can be simply written as 12 N in the direction of their combined forces. If the 3 forces are not in the same line then use trigonometry to determine the net force. ",
