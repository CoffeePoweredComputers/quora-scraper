            "answer_text": "\u2018In General\u2019 electromagnetic waves are able to \u2018pass\u2019 objects that are smaller than the wavelength of the wave. \u2018Diffraction\u2019 of any wave is a major feature of this process. If you and a friend stand near the corner of a brick building, one on each side of the corner, you can experiment with the diffraction of sound waves. Stand near the wall and you will find that lower frequency sounds will \u2018bend\u2019 around the corner more readily than will higher frequency sounds. ",
