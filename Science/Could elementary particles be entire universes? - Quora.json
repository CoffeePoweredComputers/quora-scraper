I suppose the answer would be \u201calmost definitely not.\u201d But 100 years ago, we didn\u2019t know there was anything smaller than an electron and now we know that is absolutely false. Quarks and Leptons are the smallest particles of an atom and are considered the building blocks and are incredibly much smaller than an electron. Quark > Electron > Atom > Molecule > Rock > Planet > Solar System > Solar Cluster > Galaxy > Galaxy Cluster > Universe What goes before Quark? That is unknown but perhaps not unknowable. ",

            "answer_text": "Stephen King wrote something like this in the Dark Tower series. A swirling Universe in the center of the Rose that was the Key to all Universes or something like that. If you want to really reach and say there are an infinite number of Universes then each one would contain an infinite number of particles and we get into an absurdity of possibilities where even the impossibilities become possibilities, but maybe that's the point. What's inside an atom? Let's smash it and find out. That was impossible once. It wasn't even what Atomists were thinking 2K years ago when they said things were made of things called atoms. Ok tangent done, sorry. Elementary particles by definition can't be universes. They are what make up other things, unless we are completely wrong about basically our entire understanding up to this point. That's beyond my realm of entertainable possibilities. ",

We believe we found the basic building blocks of realty, so did the scientists that found the atom. Have we found the Elementary particle? IMHO, no. They gave us the standard model\u2026now the think they found another particle not in the standard model\u2026dark matter particle ??? My point, assuming universes expand, the Elementary particle in question would either have to expand or contain a capsule to contain the expansion as mention in another answer below. We just have to see what the LHC tells us, or the newer theorized linear accelerators yield. Just think, if you are correct, we may be destroying entire civilizations. Oh well\u2026. ",
