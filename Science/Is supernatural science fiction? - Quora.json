            "answer_text": "Science fiction and fantasy are two fiction genres that are often confused and frequently actually cross into each other\u2019s realms. The most commonly accepted definition of which is which is simply whether the differences in the world as portrayed are based on technology or magic. So, Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate SG-1, and Doctor Who are all science fiction by that definition while Heroes, Supernatural, The Librarians, and Warehouse 13 are all fantasy. As I mentioned, there are some that can blur the lines a bit. A good example of this is the TV series Mutant X. For those not familiar with it, it is based on a group of humans who exhibit extraordinary abilities such as one who can generate bolts of electricity from his fingertips and another who is able to change the density of his body from being more solid than rock to being practically non-corporeal and therefore being able to walk through anything. So, this sounds like fantasy so far, yes? Well, the reason that it blurs the line is that all those who have these abilities were the subjects of DNA modifications while they were embryos. So, in other words, their abilities are the side effects of scientific manipulation. So, to answer your question, based on what I know of the series (as it is one that I have not watched), I would say that it is a fantasy series rather than science fiction. ",

            "answer_text": "It is easy to lump together genres that deal with elements not present in the real world. There are some areas where supernatural/speculative fiction and science fiction coincide, but for the most part, they each have their own unique qualities. For instance, take a look at the popular Netflix series Stranger Things. I think you\u2019d get a lot of different answers if you asked people whether it was supernatural fiction or science fiction. I don\u2019t think that it can be attributed to a single genre, so I\u2019d just call it a mixture of both. Stranger Things includes telekinesis and extra-dimensional creatures, which are more supernatural elements, but there are also scientists who precipitate these supernatural events. Even still, supernatural elements are usually far different than sci-fi elements. Things such as ghosts, demons, and extra-dimensional beings don\u2019t really have anything to do with science. The same could be said for some elements of science fiction, but the majority of science fiction is at least vaguely inspired by some scientific principles. ",
