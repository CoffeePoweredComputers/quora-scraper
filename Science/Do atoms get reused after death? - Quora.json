            "answer_text": "Most of the atoms on our planet have been here since the planet was formed. A very small number have arrived from space and a similar number are formed as a result of nuclear reactions. We are a jumble of atoms that used to be something else. We are recycled. While you are alive the atoms in your body, used to be the food, water and air you have consumed to stay alive. Since conception, your body has taken the food, water and air you take in and converted it into you. Anything the body cannot use is sent out of the body as faeces (poop), urine (pee) and the air you exhale. Side note: your digestive tract is a continuous tube that runs from your mouth to your anus. The inside of the digestive tract is actually outside the body. (weird, but true) Any food you consume is broken down by the digestion process into simple small chemicals: glucose (sugar), amino acids, (from protein), fatty acids (from fat). These very small molecules can pass through the wall of the small intestine and into the blood stream. Most of your water management happens in your large intestine. Side note to the side note\u2026 Other substances with small molecules can also get through the wall. These substance are almost all toxins. In other words if you get enough of them you will be harmed or killed. Most non-food substances like drugs such as ethanol, (the alcohol we can tolerate in very small doses) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can also pass through. Your liver is tasked with dealing with toxins. Before the liver can remove all of the toxin you will experience effects from it. Your headache might go away with the acetaminophen and your brain activity will be slowed by the alcohol. But, you don\u2019t have take acetaminophen only once in your life and never have to take it again. The liver isolates the toxins and breaks them down. If it can\u2019t you will likely not survive. There is a reason the liver is called a vital organ. The liver does many things and is a very interesting study\u2026 End of side notes. When you die your atoms are quickly recycled. If you are buried, the bacteria in your intestinal tract are not being fed anymore and start eating you. This decomposition is very temperature dependent. If you die in the tropics you will be reduced to a skeleton within days/weeks. If you are buried in a wooden coffin you quickly become worm food and then reenter the food chain and your atoms become whatever ate you\u2026 If you are unfortunate enough to be buried in a hermetically sealed crypt, you have interrupted the recycling process and your body becomes a disgusting soup of rotted flesh and bones\u2026 If you are embalmed (nice way to say pickled) this will slow down the decomposition, but will not stop it. If you die on a glacier, your body might be found nicely freeze dried and intact dozens/hundreds of years later. If you are cremated your body is burned and the gases produced are released into the atmosphere and the bones reduced to ash (mostly carbon). Your atoms released into the air are quickly recycled into other things. If your ashes are spread around, they will reenter the food chain or be converted into some mineral. Your atoms have been around for billions of years. You get to use them for a very short period of time. Enjoy while you can. You will quickly (in the terms of the age of the earth) be gone and your atoms converted into something else. ",
