            "answer_text": "It is actually the 'thermal conductivity' of the material that makes the difference. Think it as the material's capability to transfer(conduct) heat. The lower it is, the better it keeps you warm. For example, cotton has a thermal conductivity of 0.04 W/m-K, when it comes to copper, it is 401 W/m-K. That is why you feel copper is much colder than cotton no matter in summer or winter . As for wool, the thermal conductivity is 0.029 W/m-K, better than cotton.   The furry blanket is better (assuming they are of the same thickness) is probably due to the air between the blanket and your body. Air is actually a good insulation. Its thermal conductivity is 0.024 W/m-K, almost as good as wool. That is why many insulation windows are filled with air. The problem of air is that it flows, thus taking away the heat. But the furry blanket keep an layer of air between the body and the blanket, therefore give an extra layer of insulation. As for the smooth cotton blanket, it doesn't do that because it contact directly and smoothly with your body, in that way, it lose the extra layer of air insulation. ",
