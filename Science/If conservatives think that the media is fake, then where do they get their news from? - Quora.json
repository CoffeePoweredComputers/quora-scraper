            "answer_text": "Many Conservatives like myself do extensive research before believing any news. That should be the default thinking for any news. Fox, MSNBC, CNN it doesn\u2019t matter. When a story comes out that you or anyone is interested in start digging. I get my news from all over and the tentacles of a story go all over. Politco is liberal but they at time write some great articles. EnochTimes is Conservative and they write some great articles. At the same time both are guilty of putting up stories that may not be fake but they are not 100% truthful. Prime example is the recent story of \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Whitmer and immediately it was \u201cTrump supporters\u201d, etc. and I laughed. In less than a week through twitter, and social media everyone finds out they are anarchists and anti-Trump people. But you didn\u2019t see that on the \u201cfake\u201d news did you? Also fake news is considered the lack of news like I mentioned. Same with Sandmann whereas CNN and others ran with a fake story only to find out the truth. CNN and others had to retract their stories didn\u2019t they? Follow Timcast on youtube. Very liberal but he digs and finds his news. Truth is truth no matter where it comes from. ",

            "answer_text": "I watch MSM daily, mostly to see what kind of spin they have every day regarding the things going on in our country. Mostly it is the same old cookie cutter sensational news coverage on CBS, ABC, NBC, PBS, CNN, MSNBC, etc. For the most part they tell about news properly, at least the news that fits their agendas. Any news that runs counter to their agendas is conveniently not mentioned. However their Liberal Bias is plainly evident in their opinionated news stories, (especially their full on hatred of our current President and his Administration). Perhaps this is because a good percentage of the top brass in these news organizations are culled from former members of the Clinton and Obama Administrations. Globalist like the Bush and McCain families are also well represented on these news organizations. Trump is anti Globalism, and anti New World Order, and as such he is a threat to all who owe their power to these systems. At this point in time Trump is a David facing a Goliath of World proportions, and if they can\u2019t defeat him with their highly effective Propaganda apparatus at the polls, then all they have left is to manufacture a Civil War. Khrushchev was right in that pitting us against ourselves we would be conquered. ",
