            "answer_text": "Q. What is Science? (1) This answer is in the realm of Philosophy of science. (2) Science has been instrumental in many of humanity\u2019s most momentous endeavors. Sent people to the moon.Created nukes.Gave women control over their fertility.The PCThe Internet(3) People have disagreed over what all these achievements tell us about the image of our world, that science reveals. Does science give us an accurate representation of how things, nature, the world, the universe, truly are?Or, does science instead offer us something of great importance, but something quite distinct from a true picture of the universe? Maybe a set of techniques for computing observations, or a series of detailed stories that, whether true or false, have earned their keep, through their remarkable practical value?(4) Let\u2019s look at 3 possible views of science. (5) View #1: Scientific realism (5a) Simply\u2026 The goal of science is an account of the physical world that is literally true. Science is in the Truth business.Science represents those parts of the world it deals with in an increasingly accurate way over time. We understand our universe better and better over time.Science is not the only fount of knowledge. There is lots to learn from the Arts and the Humanities.Science is far from finished. Science continues to uncover the universe, refining and sharpening our images of nature.Science has been successful because this is the goal that it has been making progress towards.(5b) no-miracle argument This is the single, most popular argument to support Scientific Realism. No miracles, please. An analogy. You\u2019re trying to navigate a ship through treacherous waters. Two scenarios. You made the effort to find out the whereabouts of the submerged rocks and sandbanks. You navigated safely through. If you hadn\u2019t done your research, you would\u2019ve likely smashed your ship.You didn\u2019t do any research on the waters. In spite of your cluelessness, you were exceptionally fortunate to navigate safely through. A miracle!Apply the above to science. The waters \u2192 the universe.Your research on the waters \u2192 scientific theories on the universeNavigated safely through \u2192 Successful application of scientific theories e.g. applying physics laws to send people to the moonMiracle \u2192 The theory was actually wrong, but its application brought benefit to humanity \u2192 The physics laws were erroneous, but they got people to the moon anyway! Above: Hilary Putnam\u2019s no-miracle argument (6) View #2: Scientific theories are tools Should we think of scientific theories in the same way we think of hammers or computers. They\u2019re remarkably useful. But, they\u2019re mere tools. It makes no sense to ask whether a hammer is true. Or, whether a hammer accurately represents the world. Is this the case for science too? We should simply ask whether its theories are fit for their purposes. (7) View #3: Do we care if science accurately reflects the universe, as long as it\u2019s useful? A religious analogy. Some prominent Anglicans seem to think that the stories in the Bible are stimulating fictions, or maybe full-blown falsehoods, but we hold onto them because of the ways in which they help us navigate the world. The doctrine, the religion serves its flock. Newtonian mechanics was upended by Einstein. Newtonian mechanics sent people to the moon. Somewhat related: Sam Qwato's answer to Philosophy: What is C.S. Peirce's pragmatism? (8) More Philosophy of Science: Sam Qwato's answer to Regarding the scientific method, who was right, Thomas Kuhn or Karl Popper? ",

            "answer_text": "Science is a set of tools people used to build robust predictions. The tools are called The Scientific Method. (Some people prefer to say that Science creates explanations. That's fine. They are explanations in the form of predictions.) The first step is to come up with a falsifiable hypothesis. That's a claim which can, in theory, be proven wrong. The next step is to try to prove it wrong via careful observation and experimentation.  If you manage to falsify the hypothesis or are unable to falsify it, you will be able to use it to make predictions.  Here's a simple example: my hypothesis is that given a random sampling of New Yorkers, over 50% will prefer Coke to Pepsi in a blind taste test. That is falsifiable. It's possible that less-than 50% prefer Coke, and I can imagine ways of discovering that.  I attempt to falsify my claim by paying 1,000 New Yorkers, chosen at random, to try both Coke and Pepsi in unmarked cups. I make sure both test subjects and the people handing them the cups have no idea which cup contains Coke and which contains Pepsi.  That's called double-blind testing. It's one of many tools developed by scientists to try to make experiments as accurate as possible. Others include the use of control groups, the elimination of variables, etc.  Most of these tools are meant to mitigate human error. Science is a deeply-skeptical pursuit, and it assumes that if humans simply try to observe and reason--without the help of special tools and techniques--they will make all sorts of mistakes. For instance, if I know which cup contains Coke, I may unconsciously signal that to the test subjects. It's better if both they and I have no idea which beverage is in which cup. Let's say I discover that 80% prefer Coke. I then use that result to predict that if I try the same thing on another randomly selected group of New Yorkers, they too will prefer Coke at greater than 50%. The next part of the process is peer review. Scientists publish the results of their findings, the data they collected, and the methods the used, and let other scientists try to replicate their results.  The more repeated attempts lead to the same conclusions, the more robust the predictive power will be. Once the scientific community is convinced that New Yorkers prefer Coke to Pepsi, they can start using that prediction as a building block for other hypotheses. In other words, instead of \"if X and Y, then New Yorkers prefer Coke to Pepsi,\" they can start saying, \"Since New Yorkers prefer Coke to Pepsi, then ...\" Which is how we slowly build up a web of useful predictions.  These often become useful outside of Science, in this case maybe in marketing. Often, engineers and manufacturers use the predictions Science has come up with, for instance when they build Mars rovers and drugs that cure various diseases. ",

            "answer_text": "What is science?  Science is the concerted human effort to understand, or to understand better, the history of the natural world and how the natural world works, with observable physical evidence as the basis of that understanding1. It is done through observation of natural phenomena, and/or through experimentation that tries to simulate natural processes under controlled conditions. (There are, of course, more definitions of science.) Consider some examples. An ecologist observing the territorial behaviors of bluebirds and a geologist examining the distribution of fossils in an outcrop are both scientists making observations in order to find patterns in natural phenomena. They just do it outdoors and thus entertain the general public with their behavior. An astrophysicist photographing distant galaxies and a climatologist sifting data from weather balloons similarly are also scientists making observations but in more discrete settings. The examples above are observational science, but there is also experimental science. A chemist observing the rates of one chemical reaction at a variety of temperatures and a nuclear physicist recording the results of the bombardment of a particular kind of matter with neutrons are both scientists performing experiments to see what consistent patterns emerge. A biologist observing the reaction of a particular tissue to various stimulants is likewise experimenting to find patterns of behavior. These folks usually do their work in labs and wear impressive white lab coats, which seems to mean they make more money too. The critical commonality is that all these people are making and recording observations of nature, or of simulations of nature, in order to learn more about how nature, in the broadest sense, works. We'll see below that one of their main goals is to show that old ideas (the ideas of scientists a century ago or perhaps just a year ago) are wrong and that, instead, new ideas may better explain nature.

            "answer_text": "Science is the field of giving rigorous answers, but ironically the definition of \"science\" is itself not rigorous.  The field of \"philosophy of science\" is dedicated to trying to give an answer to the question. In school, they teach you about the scientific method: hypothesize, experiment, revise.  They don't teach you (generally) about the next step, publication.  Science is a human enterprise, conducted by fallible human beings, and for something to be science it has to be reviewed by other scientists.  This is obviously recursive and self-swallowing, not just in that it leaves open the \"base case\" of who is a scientist, but also in that peers who review the science are themselves human.  In that sense, science is itself as much art as science. And yet it muddles along.  We wouldn't be bothering to define science except that it's useful.  There's a lot of things that are clearly \"science\" and other things that are clearly \"not science\", and there's not a lot of controversy about that.  The peer review process is Good Enough. But that's not Good Enough for those who want a rigorous definition of science, and that opens a massive epistemological can of worms.  You'd really like a definition that says, \"Chemistry is science, phrenology is not\", but it turns out to be harder than you'd think.  There were great debates in the mid 20th century about whether something had to be \"verifiable\" (subject to an experiment that would confirm it) or \"falsifiable\" (subject to an experiment that could prove it false).  Both the verificationists (Vienna Circle and the Logical Positivists) and the falsificationists (Karl Popper) are subject to cases where their definitions either exclude a real science or include something widely considered pseudoscience. Then along comes Thomas Kuhn, who kind of swept both away with his theory of paradigm shift, moving away from science as an epistemological field to a more human enterprise.  He distinguishes between \"normal\" science, done in the current paradigm, and revolutions, which throw out the paradigm.   If you ask most scientists, they'll see their work in falsificationist terms, and that works well during both normal science and some revolutions.  Recent revolutions, such as quantum mechanics, have forced scientists to reconsider exactly what it means for something to be verified, since QM experiments are so fiendishly counterintuitive.   I've given only the barest outline of the debates, which are far more in-depth and complicated than I've given here.  It's a fascinating field, though, one that most elderly scientists end up turning their thoughts to at one time or another. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is a method (or tool) enabling the discovery of new observations, by the collation of data, development of models, and subsequent use of those models for prediction. Models themselves undergo change over time. I read the question Wiki with something approaching despair. It isn\u2019t a collation of all the knowledge of one hundred plus answers, and doesn\u2019t appear to contribute more than a naive personal, and cartoon like sketch of what one person considers science to be. How it is a Wiki, and not an answer staggers me. I will try to do more than a sketch, but what is a science is needs a little more explanation. There are (to my understanding) at least three ways for thinking about what constitutes a science: Science is a collection of \u2018facts\u2019 by observation (induction), which are then used to produce models that are a collation of our understanding. The key flaw with viewing science as purely induction, is the statistically small number of observations we can make, compared to a universe of potential data points. There is the possibility of being badly misled.Science is being practised if, and only if, the model utilised can be proved false (falsification). This view of science was pioneered by Karl Popper. As a model of what constitutes a science, it has the pragmatic advantage of directing experiments towards disproof of a theory, which ironically appears to expand our knowledge more rapidly than trying to shore up a theory with more and more facts. It does struggle a little with things that might be one off events, or broad sweep of scientific knowledge that don\u2019t easily fit into a model that may be falsified overall.Thomas Kuhn came up with a different view in his book The Structure of Scientific Revolution , which saw science broken into the following phases:Lack of consensus, characterised by competing theories, and large bodies of knowledge that lack a unifying principle.Normal science, which takes a unifying principle, and works within that paradigm in order to shore up a model, or theory behind that principle.Crisis where anomalies are discovered that challenge the paradigm of normal science. At this point there is often heated disagreement concerning the significance of anomalies, and denial of their existence by those still engaging in normal science.Paradigm shift, where a new model or theory has won over the majority of the scientific community, forming a new unifying principle for normal science to predict.Post revolution, where preceding science is recast into the new paradigm, giving the impression of continuous progress rather than the fits and starts demonstrated by looking at the history of events.All of the above, regardless which description you prefer as a model, indicates a science to be a tool that allows us to discover new things. Sometimes it looks like a stamp collection of things considered \u2018facts.\u2019 Sometimes it looks like a way of discovering more of our models, by deliberately challenging them. Sometimes, and certainly in the longer sweep of history, it looks like people working according to a specific set of assumptions (paradigm). In the latter case this is conducted by very human people, who resist change, who require a tipping point of observations before considering any change, at which point they switch to a new model and act as though that new new model was understood throughout earlier collection of facts. This gives an impression of continuous progress that doesn\u2019t actually match the flow of events. I suspect all these models hold something of the truth of what constitutes a science. If we try to shoe horn science into only one or other, then we will probably stumble into needing the others for completeness. What science is not might be as interesting as what it is. Science is not: An explanation for one-off events, that are not amenable to modelling or predictionA set of beliefs, even though practitioners may demonstrate some semblance to belief if their paradigm is challengedAn explanation of everything, with nothing yet to discover. If it were that, it\u2019d no longer be a tool for discovery, and it wouldn\u2019t need any further research.Holistically, I see science best summarised as per my opening paragraph: Science is a method (or tool) enabling the discovery of new observations, by the collation of data, development of models, and subsequent use of those models for prediction. Models themselves undergo change over time. As a closing note, it can be helpful to think about models. Models used in the sciences, are really a form of simulation. They are not truth in themselves. Maarten Steinbuch has posted the following statement about simulation to help focus the mind: Simulation is like masturbation: the more you do it, the more you think it is the real thing![1] Footnotes[1] Statements to remember on Theory and Practice",

You and I are constantly trying to figure out truth through our senses, but often we can be tricked into believing something that\u2019s false. Science applies the principles of logic to help us interpret what we observe. A basic example: A find a small box. What\u2019s in the box? I have no idea. Let\u2019s use science to find out! First, I look at the box and on the outside it says \u201c24K gold ingot\u201d. This is my first piece of data. It gives me a solid clue of what might be in the box. Is this a very good clue? It depends. If I were inside a bank vault, it would suggest there really is gold in the box. But if I were in a theater prop store, I would _logically_ assume it was probably fake. In one case, I would be more sure than the other, but I\u2019m not _completely_ sure. How can I be more sure? I need another observation. This time I lift the box. It\u2019s very heavy. Logically, this is exactly what I expect because gold is a dense, heavy metal. Now I have two observations that agree with the gold \u201chypothesis.\u201d I\u2019m starting to get excited. I\u2019m still not totally sure, so I need yet another observation. Now I actually open the box. Inside I can see a small brick of shiny yellow metal that definitely looks like gold. I have three confirming observations. This is enough that I now I feel confident try to sell it at a gold shop. There are some important things to notice about the above story that will help you understand science: At every point in the story, I am becoming more and more convinced that the truth is that there really is gold in the box.But: at any point in the story I could also make an observation that would prove there was not gold after all. The box could have been light. Or I could have seen a big rock when I opened it. I could have been 99% sure there was gold one moment and 0% sure then next.I am never 100% sure. Even after the 3rd observation, I will need more evidence if I hope to sell it. The gold dealer will perform even more tests to make sure it is pure gold before she gives me money.This is the nature of science. We make more and more observations, building up a case for the truth until we are proved otherwise. A true scientist is always open to being proved false, because that is the way truth is discovered. I want to stress here that scientific method can never get us to a 100% sure way of understanding truth. At the foundation of science is a logical principle that is based on probability. It is called \u201cOccam\u2019s Razor\u201d, and it says that given two explanations for a thing, the simplest explanation is most likely to be correct. Every scientific conclusion, discovery, or theory is ultimately based on this principle. This may seem like a weakness, and it is, but we must remember that in spite of this weakness, science has been spectacularly successful at advancing our knowledge and technology. This is because we have been relentlessly pushing our observations so that if we can\u2019t be 100% sure, we can at least be 99.9999% sure. The lesson is that science is wonderful and powerful, but it\u2019s not scientific to ever be absolutely sure. ",

            "answer_text": "This question has spawned an entire discipline: Philosophy of science; and its more rigorous form is known as the demarcation problem[1], i.e., how to differentiate science from non-science (which includes, but is not limited to, metaphysics, religion, and pseudoscience). Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have a clear cut definition of the term. What we have are different schools of philosophical thoughts. Thus, there is the \u201clogical positivism\u201d of the Vienna and Berlin circles, which holds that scientific statements should be verifiable. There is the \u201cfalsification\u201d of Karl Popper, requiring that scientific theories should ideally be falsifiable (and not just verifiable). There is Thomas Kuhn\u2019s \u201cpost-positivism,\u201d which emphasizes that a scientific paradigm is useful only insofar as it is successful in solving new puzzles while continuing to provide solutions for older problems. Surprisingly, there are those who believe that demarcation problem is ultimately an unsolvable epistemic dilemma. Even so, my favorite discourse on the nature of science was written almost five centuries ago by none other than Francis Bacon, which \u2014 though less precise and a bit more wishy-washy than the theses of Popper and Kuhn \u2014 is infinitely more enjoyable to read. Bacon compared science to the legendary Sphinx \u2014 a part-human, part-animal creature which dwelt on the summit of a mountain near Thebes and posed a riddle to wayward travelers, killing them if they answered wrongly. Only Oedipus managed to solve the riddles successfully and vanquish the monster, winning the kingship of Thebes as a reward. Here is what Bacon writes: Science, being the wonder of the ignorant and unskilful, may be not absurdly called a monster. In figure and aspect it is represented as many-shaped, in allusion to the immense variety of matter with which it deals. It is said to have the face and voice of a woman, in respect of its beauty and facility of utterance. Wings are added because the sciences and the discoveries of science spread and fly abroad in an instant; the communication of knowledge being like that of one candle with another, which lights up at once. Claws, sharp and hooked, are ascribed to it with great elegance, because the axioms and arguments of science penetrate and hold fast the mind, so that it has no means of evasion or escape; a point which the sacred philosopher also noted: The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails driven deep in. Again, all knowledge may be regarded as having its station on the heights of mountains; for it is deservedly esteemed a thing sublime and lofty, which looks down upon ignorance as from an eminence, and has moreover a spacious prospect on every side, such as we find on hill-tops. It is described as infesting the roads, because at every turn in the journey or pilgrimage of human life, matter and occasion for study assails and encounters us. Again Sphinx proposes to men a variety of hard questions and riddles which she received from the Muses. In these, while they remain with the Muses, there is probably no cruelty; for so long as the object of meditation and inquiry is merely to know, the understanding is not oppressed or straitened by it, but is free to wander and expatiate, and finds in the very uncertainty of conclusion and variety of choice a certain pleasure and delight; but when they pass from the Muses to Sphinx, that is from contemplation to practice, whereby there is necessity for present action, choice, and decision, then they begin to be painful and cruel; and unless they be solved and disposed of, they strangely torment and worry the mind, pulling it first this way and then that, and fairly tearing it to pieces. Moreover the riddles of the Sphinx have always a twofold condition attached to them; distraction and laceration of mind, if you fail to solve them; if you succeed, a kingdom. For he who understands his subject is master of his end; and every workman is king over his work.[2]  Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626) Footnotes[1] Demarcation problem - Wikipedia[2] XXVIII.

            "answer_text": "Science is about determining the difference between reality and imagination. The funny thing is that this is so because science is made up of the assembled fragments that are formed by the creation and elimination of imagination itself as it renders reality.  Science is an agricultural affair. It begins with observations made in a set of circumstances - like a seed in soil.  From this first formant we develop hypotheses in harmony like a chord across keys. This are the sprouts of the seedling.  A solution to the problem of scale Then, as the tender tendrils exit their initial imaginative environment they are tested by the context into which they creep. Some will wither. Some won\u2019t.  A decision tree Of those that flourish (as subsequent successes in trials centralise their structure) a fractal formation proceeds. What begins as only one branch may bear fruit thirty, sixty or a hundred times over.  Yes. Broccoli is a fractal. Now, every branch that does not bear fruit is pruned. It has no place in the ongoing process. Furthermore, the process produces its own procedure such that every fruit contains a new seed. In this way, deduction down to the most optimised vehicle acts as an ark that allows a new set of circumstances to induce a new stem.  Neuronal plasticity is promoted by this perpetual practice So, science is the objective of ontology - the certain knowledge that emerges from the rigorous refinement of renderings of reality. It is the marble which makes itself before being hewn by its own heuristics such that every fragment forms a future foundation. Some will never be built upon. Others will become the cornerstones and capstones of complete constructions. The beauty is that there is no end. Seasons come and go and everything has its place but the stuff of science endures eternally. It is the emergent activity of all actuality incarnate in intelligence. Simple isn\u2019t it? All sewn up. Just one question: Where do we start?  ",

            "answer_text": "Science means the perfect unbiased analysis of all the items and concepts of the imaginable creation. We welcome science as far as the path of the analysis is concerned. At the end, the right conclusion should be drawn and some scientists draw the wrong conclusion, which is in the opposite direction to the right conclusion. Science is like the straight tusk of the tree and these two conclusions are like the two branches generating from the tip of the tusk in the opposite directions. We also travel along the tusk in line with the atheists. We differ from the atheist at the end of the analysis only. Atheists take the direction of the wrong conclusion and we take the direction of the right conclusion. Our right conclusion is that no item of this imaginary creation is God and no concept related to this creation can be the concept of God. The wrong conclusion of the atheists is that nothing exists beyond this imaginable creation and hence God does not exist. We use the analysis of science to negate every item of the creation to be God (Neti Neti-Veda). Science is the indirect knowledge of God by which we reject the entire creation to be God and conclude that God, the creator, is beyond the creation. The direct knowledge of God is that God is beyond this creation and more than this no information of God is possible. We can show you what is not God and we cannot show you what is God. Space is the first item of the creation, which is not the absence of any imaginable item. Space is only very subtle invisible energy. Bend of space spoken in science proves this. There cannot be bending of nothing. God is the generator of this space or subtle energy. Veda says that God is generator of space and in another place says that God is the generator of energy. Both these statements are one and the same since space is subtle energy. The generator of space cannot have space in it. This means that there is no space in God. This results in saying that God is beyond spatial dimensions. We can never imagine that, which has no spatial dimensions. Hence, God is unimaginable. The atheist may ask proof for the existence of unimaginable and say that unimaginable without proof does not exist. One proof is the existence of unimaginable events called miracles in this world. The atheist may discard this proof saying that the miracle is only magic. The magic looks like miracle but on deep observation and analysis can be disproved. But, there are certain unimaginable events, which cannot be disproved even on deepest observations and deepest analysis. The atheist says that the magic of yesterday called as miracle is proved today and hence all the miracles will be proved as magic by tomorrow. But, this tomorrow never comes since the atheist is not stipulating the time gap for this tomorrow. Yesterday, you could not touch the roof of the house by your hand. Today, you touched the roof by practicing the high jump. Based on this, you are saying that you will continue the practice of high jump and touch the sky by tomorrow. We have experienced the today, which is present after the past yesterday, but this tomorrow is never experienced by us even though we waited up to the end of our life. Your promise of the time gap has utterly failed. The reason is that the sky can never be touched by you. But the roof is touched by you because it is touchable after certain practice. Today, you can touch the upper horizontal log of the door even without practice. By this, you can conclude three categories: a) touchable today, b) touchable by tomorrow after certain efforts and c) untouchable on any day. The three corresponding items of the creation to the above three categories are: a) visible-imaginable, b) invisible-imaginable and c) invisible-unimaginable. The ordinary person belongs to the first item. The scientist belongs to the second item. The philosopher belongs to the third item. If you are not willing to accept the genuine miracles, there is one outstanding miracle, which is beyond your understanding. You cannot deny this since it is referred by science as infinity. This creation or universe is infinite with unimaginable boundary. This is practically experienced through not only our eyes but also through your powerful telescopes. You have to accept the existence of unimaginable indicated by the word infinite. This universe is created by God, which is emerged from the God. When you touch the boundary of this imaginable universe, it means, you have touched the unimaginable God. There are only two items here. One is the unimaginable God and the other is the imaginable universe. The joint line between these two items cannot be a third item, which is different from the two items since only two items exist. Hence the end of one item means the beginning of the other item. When you have reached the end of the ocean, you have touched the beginning of the land. Therefore, if you have reached the end of imaginable universe, you must touch the beginning of unimaginable God. Since unimaginable can never be touched by anybody, which is even beyond imagination, it means that you can never reach the end of the imaginable universe. This is a practical scientific example that has to be accepted by any human being as a proof for the existence of the unimaginable, which is called by the word \u2018God\u2019 by us. Once the atheist accepts the unimaginable God, further extensions of this concept like human incarnation etc can be easily introduced. When God has unimaginable nature or capability to do any unimaginable action, such unimaginable God enters a specific human form for a specific program like preaching the spiritual knowledge that gives right direction for the spiritual aspirants to become human incarnation. When the capability of the unimaginable God cannot be questioned, you cannot oppose the probability of the concept of human incarnation of God especially when there is a genuine need. Hence, the establishment of the concept of unimaginable God is the main effort and other concepts become easy. Hence, Shankara tried to establish the existence of God in the minds of the atheists. Further concepts of worship of God etc were easily established by the followers like Ramanuja and Madhva. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question. Even though we often say we are living in the age of science, the word is often poorly understood and misused. Wikipedia's science (disambiguation) page makes it clear why the term might mean different things to different people. Instead of dealing with all the various meanings, let's look at the sort of science that gives us things like telecommunications, computers and space exploration. That kind of science is a disciplined, rule-based method for organizing information about how the world around us, and the universe it is in, actually work. It's a method for developing and refining a model that maps increasingly well to observed reality. Science currently deals with all the issues listed in the illustration below, and as the Scale of the Universe index on the left indicates, future improvements in our ability to observe at the very small and very large scale may extend what we are able to model.  How does that kind of science work? It uses the scientific method to refine. alter, expand or reject hypotheses. The steps of the scientific method are outlined below. Once a scientist has run though this entire process and it appears that the hypothesis is valid, s/he writes up all the steps in detail and submits it to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. Other scientists around the world look at the work and try to spot errors in methods or incorrect conclusions of observations. They duplicate the testing process to see if they get the same results. They think about whether some alternative explanation might better describe why the results were obtained. Only ideas that survive this rigorous review process become accepted theories, and even afterward, scientists continue to look for ways the theory might be improved or refined to yield and even more accurate mapping of observable results.  The above process is often slow and laborious, but it is the best method human beings have yet discovered to systematically increase our actual understanding of how \"life, the Universe and everything\" actually works.

            "answer_text": "Logical positivism, better known by its common name \u2018science\u2019, is the philosophy that what is verifiable empirically is what is cognitively meaningful to us - or in other, less precise terms, that what can be demonstrated in experiment is what we should hold to be \u2018true\u2019. Science in the modern age is exemplified not by the set of facts which we currently believe to be most accurate, but rather by the methodology by which we derive such \u2018facts\u2019 from our observations of the natural world. Of course, that seems like a rather obscure answer - does one really gain an understanding of science if it is explained as a methodology used to derive \u2018facts\u2019? Allow me to elaborate: The model of scientific progress is empirical in nature, and thus focuses primarily on the phenomena of the natural world. It relies on the following process to produce its results, the most striking of which is the device we\u2019re using to communicate right now - a computer; observations of (anomalous) phenomena -> the formulation of hypotheses which propose to explain the observed data -> experiments which have the potential to falsify the hypotheses in question -> more observations about the outcome of the experiment. These secondary observations lead scientists to formulate new hypotheses to replace the falsified ones as well as to propose new experiments which could yet falsify those hypotheses which proceeded uncontested through our previous tests. This process produces functional and pragmatic utility because it rejects every explanation which fails to maintain consistency with our observations of the natural world, and thereby it ensures that those which triumph over time are those models which have predictive accuracy. The accuracy to which I refer becomes obvious when we succeed in creating combustion engines to make cars run, or jet engines combined with modern aerodynamic engineering which enables planes to fly - the models which inform our designs must share something in common with the truth of our environment, or such results would be impossible. Over the course of history, natural philosophers have produced many interpretations of the world, yet none have proved as useful in our efforts to manipulate our environment as science; there is clearly something about this reductive, naturalistic approach that enables us to progress towards our goals with an effectiveness that is unprecedented and unparalleled. Science may never produce an absolute truth, mostly because such a thing is unattainable from the subjective perspective we inherently inhabit, yet nonetheless, it represents our best guess yet at a formula, limited as it may be, for truth. How does science work, one might ask? Consistency. Consistency with what, my good man? Ah, now that is the question. Good luck - it\u2019s an enigma, to be sure. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is basically the study of matter and energy using the scientific method and has been responsible for all technological advancements in society. It is na\u00efve to think that science has or will have all the answers to how the universe works at the smallest and largest level. Theoretically so far a heavy but small form of matter from which apparently sub atomic particles come from and makes up atoms is the Higgs boson with a Higgs field and mathematically string theory attempts to explain everything in the universe in terms of vibrations which has led to the concept of a holographic universe. The Hubble telescope has confirmed that there is indeed turbulence in the universe and that concepts such as dark gravity, dark matter, and dark energy which can\u2019t be detected or observed directly with scientific instruments may play a significant role in the universe. A concept such as a black hole which is an infinitely small point in space with infinite gravity and mass is in fact probably a grey hole where some energy or photons can escape so the concept of a black hole is wrong and a grey hole is also something very ludicrous. There is evidence of galaxies colliding so this casts doubt on the big bang hypothesis that all matter and energy in the universe originated from an infinitely small point in space or in effect a universal black hole. The concept of an expanding universe or the big bang is actually a modern scientific myth. The universe may in fact be infinite and relatively homogeneous and there are only little bang localized \u201cgrey\u201d holes in the middle of some or all galaxies. Mathematics as a tool is inadequate and results in singularities in every theory because no one really understands what an infinitely small point in space is and no one understands what infinity really means. What is the point of all this? Scientists are totally confused trying to explain the workings of the universe and no one unified theory seems to be a possible explanation including Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity which is outdated and mostly wrong. Humans are just not smart enough to explain all the intricate workings of the universe and won\u2019t be on into the foreseeable future. That being said there have been attempts at using science to explain society and politics such as social science and political science and this is all a myth because politics and society can\u2019t be studied with the scientific method and the closest that we can get is explaining politics and society in terms of vague statistical concepts or approximations with no cause effect relationships. Statistical methods will never come up with a moral code which should govern human behavior and nor will scientific research into animal behavior lead to the discovery of a moral code. In nature no one likes to be stolen from but this is not enough knowledge to formulate political laws which justly distribute information, goods, and services to its citizens, especially the destitute and also unemployed. Scientists must function independently of social or political monetary pressure to make objective discoveries possible. The corruption of big money in pharmaceutical companies is resulting in many fraudulent clinical statistical experiments conducted by scientists in the study of drugs and many drugs with terrible side effects are being approved by the FDA. Scientific R&D and the potential benefits which new revolutionary discoveries can make in society are sometimes bought up or kept secret by major corporations who don\u2019t want the new technology to adversely affect their bottom line profits. For true long duration benefit to society science must be funded by organizations which are impartial and not subject to money or political pressure. If independence from greed in the scientific community is not promoted then science will only be used to promote the politically powerful interests and only biased results will exit science labs. Scientists are playing God altering the genetic makeup of plants and animals and giant corporations are patenting the results without long duration testing of the resultant products on the human population. Myopic selection of genes based on a few desirable traits such as pest resistance, herbicide resistance, experimental gene insertion from bacteria, size, and fat content are producing Frankenstein crops and animals too dependent on humans which will not be healthy for the human population in the long duration. Emphasis on monopolistic monoculture is going to destroy healthy long duration food biodiversity. Gene modification has great potential for the manufacturing of many desirable substances biologically but it should not become unproven experimentation on the precious food supply. Uncovered bad effects on long duration human health may be irreversible and disasterously deadly since what you eat can potentially modify the metabolism or genetic functioning of future generations. Science is a powerful tool which can be used for good and/or bad purposes. Secretive science experimentation should not be going on in private laboratories with diabolical purposes in mind. Financed open source science is vital to monitor the biological products coming out of powerful companies. Independent research science facilities should exist to thoroughly retest and evaluate new genetic creations and drugs and they should be rewarded financially if they come up proof that indeed the new products flooding the market are indeed too harmful to be accepted into the economies of the world. CONCLUSION: Science is a tool which can be used for good and/or bad purposes. Will there be powerful monopolies judging the new biological products or should there be an independent watchdog? I don\u2019t see a danger to the world coming from physical science but I do foresee great danger to the world coming from biological science if it is not objectively monitored with financed open source information.

            "answer_text": "In laymans terms Science is a way of learning about the world through observing whats happening, creating an idea of whats going on (that\u2019s called a hypothesis), testing your idea as much as you are physically able, and revising it if your results from the test don\u2019t match what you originally came up with. Unlike other dogmatic approaches science at least in ideal circumstances self corrects. To start off with you come up with an idea of how the world works based on the things you can see going on. Then you would test them, if you think water disappears into dirt because worms are drinking it you would get a bucket of dirt with no worms and see if the water still disappears into it. If you do an experiment based on the rules of how the world works and you get an unexpected outcome you don\u2019t ignore it. Instead you go back to the rules and start re-writing them to match with actually happened when you tested them. This means that you\u2019re constantly correcting any mistakes or bad assumptions you have. One famous example of this would be the work on gravity done by Galileo. At the time it was generally accepted that heavier objects fell faster because\u2026 well they\u2019re heavier why wouldn\u2019t they? After some study though Galileo was able to prove objects of different weights would fall to the ground at the same pace, by dropping two balls of the Leaning Tower of Pisa no less and waiting for them to hit the ground. This changed a lot of things in physics and proved our assumptions about the world incorrect. Oh and on a final note a lot of laymen mix up theory and hypothesis. A hypothesis is an idea about how the world works, usually based on what you can observe happening around you. A theory is a hypothesis that has passed all the tests you can currently do and matches the real world. The reason we go with theory instead of fact is that a theory is always being challenged and constantly subject updates. I mentioned gravitation theory before and I should point out that while Galileo was right about how that part of gravitational attraction operates we\u2019re still learning new things about it today, like how gravity operates around black holes or what effect it has on space in general, which means we have to update the rules for gravitation in case something we thought we had down pat turns out to be more complicated then originally believed.

            "answer_text": "The word \"science\" probably brings to mind many different pictures: a fat textbook, white lab coats and microscopes, an astronomer peering through a telescope, a naturalist in the rainforest, Einstein's equations scribbled on a chalkboard, the launch of the space shuttle, bubbling beakers \u2026. All of those images reflect some aspect of science, but none of them provides a full picture because science has so many facets:  Science is both a body of knowledge and a process. In school, science may sometimes seem like a collection of isolated and static facts listed in a textbook, but that's only a small part of the story. Just as importantly, science is also a process of discovery that allows us to link isolated facts into coherent and comprehensive understandings of the natural world.Science is exciting. Science is a way of discovering what's in the universe and how those things work today, how they worked in the past, and how they are likely to work in the future. Scientists are motivated by the thrill of seeing or figuring out something that no one has before.Science is useful. The knowledge generated by science is powerful and reliable. It can be used to develop new technologies, treat diseases, and deal with many other sorts of problems.Science is ongoing. Science is continually refining and expanding our knowledge of the universe, and as it does, it leads to new questions for future investigation. Science will never be \"finished.\"Science is a global human endeavor. People all over the world participate in the process of science. And you can too!

            "answer_text": "Wikipedia says of science \u201c\u2026 a enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe\u201d and I think it does hit the main point of what science is all about. Why scientists work on every day? To understand the universe and understand how things work and fit in. Why do we want to understand that? So that we can predict what will happen if we do something, how something is supposed to act if something else happens to it. This is a generalistic approach, but I think it is valid, because it may also ask: \u201cWhy do we care?\u201d. You see, you can\u2019t deny that science has had a substantial, I would say without a doubt, a defining rule in the shape of our modern societies. And yet, many question if we should still be working on science. They say something like \u201cIs that going to be useful at all?\u201d. As a scientist, (at least now, I can call myself a minor one) it\u2019s really frustrating. And it depends on the science too. #THIS NEXT PART IS JUST A PERSONAL RANT. TL;DR: PEOPLE ARE NOT CARING ENOUGH ABOUT SCIENCE BECAUSE WE DON\u2019T HAVE ENOUGH SCIENCE POSTER CHILDS THAT CAUSE A HUGE UPROAR AND BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TURNING SCIENCE POLITICAL. In life and environmental sciences, it\u2019s easy to show how it can affect our daily lives, since regularly they have applications that may affect us directly. Chemistry also has some clear motivations for the public, because while they may not have a direct application, they have an industry, which is interested in the progress of chemistry. As for physics, we kind of reach a dilemma. Now we have applied physicists, and the projects I have worked on was essentially applied physics, so there is still some interest in that area. But I want to work on the fundamental fields someday, and it\u2019s really hard to find any useful application for fundamental physical research in less than 60 years. It didn\u2019t use to be like that. A good example would be the discovery of x-rays. Less than 20 years after its discovery, doctors had already seen its use for something that was very hard to do back then. Being able to see inside of someone without cutting they open. It was revolutionary. Somehow, medicine has been the area that has benefitted from physics the most this last century, other than the tech industry. The new diagnostic and therapeutic tools provided to medicine due to the quantum revolution, that also led to the development of computers and everything that followed it. General relativity allowed for the development of GPS, and for the proper usage of artificial satellites. These are all things that now are more and more prevalent in our lives, and yet, most of the physics required for them is more than 60 years old. Again, we do have some exceptions in the tech industry and medicine, but as for as the common person goes, physics stopped being relevant. And right now, science as a whole as grown so complex that it\u2019s hard for one person to even revolutionize one single field of a science, let alone revolutionize all of it. What would it take to do so? I can\u2019t fathom it, and that\u2019s because I\u2019m not an Einstein. And because I\u2019m a Feynmann either, I can\u2019t show people the marvels of science and captivate an audience as he did, specially since back then he wouldn\u2019t be competing with the Kardashians or Marvel movies (just comics). So these and many other factors explain why science has lost importance in the eyes of the public, and scientists themselves are losing trust from the public, for things that really shouldn\u2019t be political, like climate change. But that doesn\u2019t change science core principle of understanding the universe and predicting its next move. #THAT ENDS THE RANT. SORRY ABOUT THAT But in the end, science is all about working hard, (now as a team more than often) to try and solve an existing question, and maybe from there understand the universe a little bit better, predict what happens in similar circumstances and solve the new questions that will unavoidably pop up. I hope that helped. ",

            "answer_text": "In modern times, science is defined as an understanding that can be proven wrong. For example, let's say gravitation, throw an apple into the sky, then it will fall off, because it is attracted by the gravity of the earth. This understanding is a science. Gravity can have many conclusions. Apples will fall to the ground, bananas will fall to the ground, and pears will fall to the ground. These conclusions are clear and may be overturned. You can overthrow it through experiments and research. Any scientific theory may prove to be wrong. In turn, non-scientific theories are those that you can neither prove nor disprove. You cannot draw conclusions that can be clearly verified from these theories. For example, you cannot prove that there is a soul after death, nor can you prove that there is no soul after death. It is difficult for you to find an accurate conclusion from some of the widely circulated soul theories. Once you prove that this conclusion is wrong, you can overturn the whole theory. A theory that has no conclusion that might be overturned is non-scientific. one more thing, an interesting thing, mathematics, a discipline usually considered to be science, can have a wonderful connection with non-science. The development of modern logic (a branch of modern mathematics) has proved the unscientific nature of a series of mathematics. This is confusing and in some cases even desperate. Because it vaguely implies from one side that our thinking model does not break through the bottleneck of cognition well. So there is a hypothesis that our science, or more specifically, our mathematics, has been locked up by the weapons of the mathematical laws of higher civilizations. ",

            "answer_text": " Image: \"Sniffing\" bees trained for security at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Credit: LANL Science is a systematic and logical approach to discovering how things in the universe work. It is also the body of knowledge accumulated through the discoveries about all the things in the universe. The word \"science\" is derived from the Latin word scientia, which is knowledge based on demonstrable and reproducible data, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. True to this definition, science aims for measurable results through testing and analysis. Science is based on fact, not opinion or preferences. The process of science is designed to challenge ideas through research. One important aspect of the scientific process is that it is focuses only on the natural world, according to the University of California. Anything that is considered supernatural does not fit into the definition of science. The scientific method When conducting research, scientists use the scientific method to collect measurable, empirical evidence in an experiment related to a hypothesis(often in the form of an if/then statement), the results aiming to support or contradict a theory. \"As a field biologist, my favorite part of the scientific method is being in the field collecting the data,\" Jaime Tanner, a professor of biology at Marlboro College, told Live Science. \"But what really makes that fun is knowing that you are trying to answer an interesting question. So the first step in identifying questions and generating possible answers (hypotheses) is also very important and is a creative process. Then once you collect the data you analyze it to see if your hypothesis is supported or not.\" The steps of the scientific method go something like this: Make an observation or observations.Ask questions about the observations and gather information.Form a hypothesis \u2014 a tentative description of what's been observed, and make predictions based on that hypothesis.Test the hypothesis and predictions in an experiment that can be reproduced.Analyze the data and draw conclusions; accept or reject the hypothesis or modify the hypothesis if necessary.Reproduce the experiment until there are no discrepancies between observations and theory. \"Replication of methods and results is my favorite step in the scientific method,\" Moshe Pritsker, a former post-doctoral researcher at Harvard Medical School and CEO of JoVE, told Live Science. \"The reproducibility of published experiments is the foundation of science. No reproducibility \u2013 no science.\"Some key underpinnings to the scientific method: The hypothesis must be testable and falsifiable, according to North Carolina State University. Falsifiable means that there must be a possible negative answer to the hypothesis.Research must involve deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is the process of using true premises to reach a logical true conclusion while inductive reasoning takes the opposite approach.An experiment should include a dependent variable (which does not change) and an independent variable (which does change).An experiment should include an experimental group and a control group. The control group is what the experimental group is compared against.Scientific theories and laws The scientific method and science in general can be frustrating. A theory is almost never proven, though a few theories do become scientific laws. One example would be the laws of conservation of energy, which is the first law of thermodynamics. Dr. Linda Boland, a neurobiologist and chairperson of the biology department at the University of Richmond, Virginia, told Live Science that this is her favorite scientific law. \"This is one that guides much of my research on cellular electrical activity and it states that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only changed in form. This law continually reminds me of the many forms of energy,\" she said. A law just describes an observed phenomenon, but it doesn't explain why the phenomenon exists or what causes it. \"In science, laws are a starting place,\" said Peter Coppinger, an associate professor of biology and biomedical engineering at the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. \"From there, scientists can then ask the questions, 'Why and how?'\" Laws are generally considered to be without exception, though some laws have been modified over time after further testing found discrepancies. This does not mean theories are not meaningful. For a hypothesis to become a theory, rigorous testing must occur, typically across multiple disciplines by separate groups of scientists. Saying something is \"just a theory\" is a layperson's term that has no relationship to science. To most people a theory is a hunch. In science, a theory is the framework for observations and facts, Tanner told Live Science. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is the discipline which aims to explain natural phenomena. Curiosity is the source of science. Mathematics is the language of science. The main aim of science is to understand the workings of the universe. Logic, reasoning and describing the physical world in the language of mathematics is science. Mathematics is the language of science. This however, doesn\u2019t mean that the mathematical details have no intuitive explanation. It is totally naive to assume this. If there is no intuitive explanation of the mathematical details, the theory hasn\u2019t been understood. Science is based on the Scientific method: >The natural phenomenon is observed. Curiosity then leads to the study of the phenomenon. >The first step lies in determining the parameters on which the given phenomenon depends. This is done experimentally and is based on trial and error. The problem here is that not ALL parameters may be determined. Some parameters may only be determined afterwards, when everything doesn\u2019t seem to work out as expected. > After finding the parameters(maybe not all), we find out HOW are these parameters related to the phenomenon. For example, what happens when we increase or decrease some parameter? Is it directly proportional or inversely proportional to the phenomenon under study?Does some parameter have exponents? >After this has been done, we pack in all these parameters and the given phenomenon into a neat little equation, by introducing a constant of proportionality. >Thus, we have studied the phenomenon to some extent. Now we consider the phenomenon itself to be a parameter and study how other parameters behave. Studying one parameter at a time is best. > After this, a theory is made to explain the phenomenon under study. This theory must be able to explain what is observed. If it does not, the theory has to be replaced by a better theory. After we find out the most suitable explanation, the theory can be used for practical applications. >Now if we have left out some parameter, it will lead to undesired results when that parameter starts interfering. It is now required to study the parameter which was left out and understand its effects. This also means that we have to modify our theory, until it is able to explain the effects. >This can again be used for practical applications. The process of modifying that theory takes place again and again. No theory can be called final. >Now comes the interesting part of analysis: we use graphical methods to illustrate how the parameters are related. This is the reason mathematics is required. Mathematics is used to \u2018describe\u2019 different curves obtained. This \u2018description\u2019 of the \u2018behaviour\u2019 of the parameters is put in a mathematical model of the physical phenomenon. This model must be able to explain intuitively, WHY the theory works. If it doesn\u2019t, the theory has to be modified. > After obtaining many such mathematical models, it is now possible to RELATE various quantities together, using logical approach(theoretical physics). This method of relating quantities together can lead to many new relations, previously not found. This leads to new theories. All the time, it is the theories that are getting modified and not the mathematical models. This is because, the mathematical models which have been determined make intuitive sense. The theories however, may not. >This is the reason why some equations don\u2019t make intuitive sense. But all we need to do is UNDERSTAND mathematics for this. The understanding of mathematics leads to understanding of physical principles, i.e. the physical world. ",

            "answer_text": "I define science as that small set of knowledge on which we can expect universal agreement.  We many never agree on whether chocolate is the most delicious flavor in the world, or whether the best government is based on capitalism or socialism -- but we do expect to agree on whether electrons orbit nuclei. Here is a relevant anecdote: Some decades ago, the great scientist Walter Alvarez (discovered what killed the dinosaurs) told me he was beginning a project to study Milankovitch cycles.  (Those are climate cycles seen in ancient rock, typically 23,000 and 1,000,000 year periods.)  I told him that although I had not studied the field, I had grave doubts about the reality of those cycles.  He said that he did not want to start a project about which I was dubious, but I told him that I wasn't sure. We decided to hold a seminar, lasting one semester, in which we would have students report on the subject, and we would do extensive reading to lead the work. Here is the fascinating point, one that I realized when we began the seminar.  He and I knew -- we really knew -- that at the end of the semester, we would be in agreement.  We didn't know if we would accept the Milankovitch theory, or if we would reject it (or somewhere in between) but we knew we would agree.  That's because it was a scientific question.   At the end of the semester, we were in agreement.  The Milankovitch theory was basically correct, but some details needed further study. I wound up spending the next ten years of my life investigating those details, writing numerous papers, and writing a major technical book on the subject. (It's that work that led me to the study of global warming.) That was science. On politics, Walter and I frequently disagree, and we have no expectation that we will ever agree.  But on science, we always have that expectation. ",

In other words, \u201cscience\u201d and each of its many fields, involve you trying to use your mind and brain to \u201csleuth out\u201d whatever seems interesting to you. About 50 years ago, I think a great example occurred. Some kid who was still a student in College got a summer job as a Forest Ranger. Not much was expected of him. But one day while he was sitting out in the woods eating his sandwich for lunch, a consistent wind arose through the woods he was sitting in. As an observant kid, he NOTICED that all the trees (which were all the same species and age, since they had been planted together some years earlier) were rocking back and forth together. Except for ONE TREE. He had noticed something which later turned out to be really important. Do you know why? He sat there, eating his lunch AND THINKING. He realized that \u201cthere must be something different about that one tree. So he went over and studied it, but there seemed to be nothing different. He used his spray paint marker to put a prominent mark on that tree. Later, he described all this to his boss, and suggested that \u201cthere must be something different INSIDE that tree, and he suggested that it be cut down. The Boss smiled at a \u201cyoung kid\u201d. Months later, a deadly tree disease was found to be killing much of that forest. A (higher) Boss decided to cut down that one marked tree, and they found that it was filled with rotten wood and disease. That \u201cyoung kid\u201d had \u201capplied science and logic\u201d to figure out something which no one else could detect. An IDEAL application of what science actually is. Be observant. Be logical. And then sleuth through what you can find. ",

            "answer_text": "Logical positivism, better known by its common name \u2018science\u2019, is the philosophy that what is verifiable empirically is what is cognitively meaningful to us - or in other, less precise terms, that what can be demonstrated in experiment is what we should hold to be \u2018true\u2019. Science in the modern age is exemplified not by the set of facts which we currently believe to be most accurate, but rather by the methodology by which we derive such \u2018facts\u2019 from our observations of the natural world. Of course, that seems like a rather obscure answer - does one really gain an understanding of science if it is explained as a methodology used to derive \u2018facts\u2019? Allow me to elaborate: The model of scientific progress is empirical in nature, and thus focuses primarily on the phenomena of the natural world. It relies on the following process to produce its results, the most striking of which is the device we\u2019re using to communicate right now - a computer; observations of (anomalous) phenomena -> the formulation of hypotheses which propose to explain the observed data -> experiments which have the potential to falsify the hypotheses in question -> more observations about the outcome of the experiment. These secondary observations lead scientists to formulate new hypotheses to replace the falsified ones as well as to propose new experiments which could yet falsify those hypotheses which proceeded uncontested through our previous tests. This process produces functional and pragmatic utility because it rejects every explanation which fails to maintain consistency with our observations of the natural world, and thereby it ensures that those which triumph over time are those models which have predictive accuracy. The accuracy to which I refer becomes obvious when we succeed in creating combustion engines to make cars run, or jet engines combined with modern aerodynamic engineering which enables planes to fly - the models which inform our designs must share something in common with the truth of our environment, or such results would be impossible. Over the course of history, natural philosophers have produced many interpretations of the world, yet none have proved as useful in our efforts to manipulate our environment as science; there is clearly something about this reductive, naturalistic approach that enables us to progress towards our goals with an effectiveness that is unprecedented and unparalleled. Science may never produce an absolute truth, mostly because such a thing is unattainable from the subjective perspective we inherently inhabit, yet nonetheless, it represents our best guess yet at a formula, limited as it may be, for truth.

            "answer_text": "Science is the concerted human effort to understand, or to understand better, the history of the natural world and how the natural world works, with observable physical evidence as the basis of that understanding. It is done through observation of natural phenomena, and/or through experimentation that tries to simulate natural processes under controlled conditions. (There are, of course, more definitions of science.)       Consider some examples. An ecologist observing the territorial behaviors of bluebirds and a geologist examining the distribution of fossils in an outcrop are both scientists making observations in order to find patterns in natural phenomena. They just do it outdoors and thus entertain the general public with their behavior. An astrophysicist photographing distant galaxies and a climatologist sifting data from weather balloons similarly are also scientists making observations, but in more discrete settings.       The examples above are observational science, but there is also experimental science. A chemist observing the rates of one chemical reaction at a variety of temperatures and a nuclear physicist recording the results of bombardment of a particular kind of matter with neutrons are both scientists performing experiments to see what consistent patterns emerge. A biologist observing the reaction of a particular tissue to various stimulants is likewise experimenting to find patterns of behavior. These folks usually do their work in labs and wear impressive white lab coats, which seems to mean they make more money too.       The critical commonality is that all these people are making and recording observations of nature, or of simulations of nature, in order to learn more about how nature, in the broadest sense, works. We'll see below that one of their main goals is to show that old ideas (the ideas of scientists a century ago or perhaps just a year ago) are wrong and that, instead, new ideas may better explain nature.

            "answer_text": "In semi-casual conversation, \u201cscience\u201d can mean two things: either the discipline of investigating things via the scientific method, or the knowledge one gains from such investigations. The core of the scientific method is to elevate empirical evidence over anything else. You start with a question\u2026 for example how does so-and-so work? Then you guess at an answer. Then you determine whether your guess is consistent with empirical evidence. Or in a little more detail, you design an experiment that will at least potentially falsify your guess. Ideally, this is an experiment that has never been done before, so your guess involves a genuine prediction. If not, there\u2019s at least the chance that you\u2019ve implicitly \u201cbaked in\u201d existing knowledge to your guess, so the experiment will necessarily be consistent with it. In any case, if your guess doesn\u2019t agree with the experiment, it\u2019s wrong. If it does agree with the experiment, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s right. It\u2019s just \u201cnot yet wrong,\u201d as Feynman liked to say. But yeah, if a statement is consistent with tons and tons and tons of experiments, we start to get pretty high confidence that the statement is correct. That confidence can get so high that, as a practical matter, we consider that principle to be \u201cproven,\u201d even if it\u2019s not technically incontrovertible. The collection of those principles that we have a high confidence in is also called \u201cscience.\u201d Speaking even more casually, sometimes people use \u201cscience\u201d to just refer to any body of knowledge, especially intricate knowledge, whether it comes from the scientific method or not. E.g., one might refer to \u201cthe art and science of playing the piano.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Science is ancient, about 2500 years old, at least for us in the West (Eastern scientific traditions exist, as well). The original premise for science was that everything we could observe should be explainable without blaming it on the gods. Since then that has been refined, of course. Francis Bacon gets a lot of credit for the Scientific Method, emphasizing the process of observation. Lord Kelvin aka William Thompson declared that if you can\u2019t measure it then it didn\u2019t happen. Karl Popper argued that for something to be a scientific claim then there had to be a way to test that claim that would show that it was false. There\u2019s an entire discipline about the sociology of science that studies how science happens. Thomas Kuhn observed that scientists mostly do \u201cnormal science,\u201d which involves measuring things and comparing them to theory, until we come across a discrepancy. We start to pick at the discrepancy, and eventually we have a scientific revolution. There have been many scientific revolutions, from Gallileo\u2019s description of the pendulum, to Newton\u2019s laws of motion, to Maxwell\u2019s equations of electro-magnetism, to Einstein\u2019s descriptions of the photo-electric effect, Brownian motion, and his theories of relativity, to the discoveries of dark matter and dark energy. Because of these revolutions we say that science is *provisionally* true. To me science is the single most effective method we have available for understanding our universe and ourselves. It\u2019s cured diseases, allowed us to send people and machines to the Moon and other planets, and made us more comfortable. It is true that science also is the reason why we can wage devastating wars, why our planet is threatened with climate change, and why pollution and resource extraction devastate many parts of the planet. Like all tools science can be used for ill. ",

What makes science special is controlled skepticism, which is beautifully explained by Neil deGrasse Tyson in the last episode of the \u201cCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey\u201d. He explained the five rules that are used by generation of scientists/searchers/discoverers to pursue the discovery of truth. Those five rules are, Question Authority. No idea is true just because someone says so, including me.Think for yourself. Question yourself. Don\u2019t believe something just because you want to. Believing something does not make it so.Test ideas by the evidence gained from observation and experiment. If a favorite idea fails a well designed test, its wrong! Get over it.Follow the evidence, wherever it leads. If you have no evidence, reserve judgement.And the most important rule of all, 5. Remember, You could be wrong. Many great scientists were wrong at sometimes. Einstein, Newton and every other great scientists in history. You are human. Science is a way from fooling ourselves, and each other.

            "answer_text": "The word \"science\" probably brings to mind many different pictures: a fat textbook, white lab coats and microscopes, an astronomer peering through a telescope, a naturalist in the rainforest, Einstein's equations scribbled on a chalkboard, the launch of the space shuttle, bubbling beakers \u2026. All of those images reflect some aspect of science, but none of them provides a full picture because science has so many facets:   Science is both a body of knowledge and a process. In school, science may sometimes seem like a collection of isolated and static facts listed in a textbook, but that's only a small part of the story. Just as importantly, science is also a process of discovery that allows us to link isolated facts into coherent and comprehensive understandings of the natural world.   Science is exciting. Science is a way of discovering what's in the universe and how those things work today, how they worked in the past, and how they are likely to work in the future. Scientists are motivated by the thrill of seeing or figuring out something that no one has before.  Science is useful. The knowledge generated by science is powerful and reliable. It can be used to develop new technologies, treat diseases, and deal with many other sorts of problems. Science is ongoing. Science is continually refining and expanding our knowledge of the universe, and as it does, it leads to new questions for future investigation. Science will never be \"finished.\" Science is a global human endeavor. People all over the world participate in the process of science. And you can too!  ",

            "answer_text": "Q: What is science actually? Science is the relentless application of common sense to questions about how the world works. If you want to figure out how the world works, here\u2019s a good way to go about it: Collect people\u2019s ideas and publish them, for all to see and criticize.Decide whether ideas are good or bad based on the outcome of demonstrations (\u201cexperiments\u201d). And publish the results.Encourage other people to try and reproduce the results. If they fail, encourage them to publish about their inability to reproduce the result.When there are multiple ideas about the same thing works, apply common sense: choose the idea that applies to the widest number of situations and makes the fewest random underlying assumptions.Write the best ideas down in books. Toss out the ideas that don\u2019t work so well.The ability of human beings to follow guidelines like these is mixed at best. People get hung up on their own ideas. More generally, they get hung up on the things they are taught and find it difficult to adapt to change. Sometimes even highly-trained and well-intentioned scientists go off on wild digressions that don\u2019t adhere to these guidelines at all. But experience has shown that over time, following these guidelines gets the best answers to questions about how the world works. More effective ideas often lead to better technologies, which means people who follow the guidelines are more effective at dealing with the world than people who don\u2019t over the long term. And since reality is competitive and sometimes harsh, this in turn means groups of people who follow the guidelines often replace groups of people who don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "So I see three schools of thought here: Science as method (I think this began with Descartes but really only achieved this form with Locke et al) Science as an uncertain theoretical system (models) which explains and includes the results of the method (Thomas Kuhn) and science as a certain theoretical system which embraces the product of the method as something a) known in some way and b) capable of being used as a steady basis for induction. This last seems to match up with the work of Michael Augros and the Institute for the Study of Nature: http://www.isnature.org/Files/Augros_Reconciling_Science_Philosophy.htm I find the first least convincing. If you could teach a monkey to perform experiments as a lab assistant, the monkey isn't \"doing science\", it isn't observing and noting conclusions. The one \"doing science\" is the one observing and taking notes and making inferences. In this sense science is the act of collecting, correlating and interpreting data, if it is an act.  But suppose you could teach a computer to collect like data, and spit out a working model. Is the computer a scientist? Not if it isn't a strong AI, since the computer has no actual notion of what it's doing in a weak AI context, it's just a very clever puppet. So under normal circumstances, we have only one being really \"doing science\", the human observer. But if we have now moved back behind the method to the one performing it, in what does science consist? In the one observing the method having been carried out. In other words, to do science is to observe the result of the scientific method and interpret it in a way yielding a crystallized view of the regularity of things in the physical world. But it is not enough to stop at saying \"this always happens.\" If we stopped there science would, as the green Moon people say, be like magic. The second one is interesting, but it presumes a lot. So we say, okay, we need a systematic explanation of these observations. But we try to make one, and it falls apart. Then we say, we need another, and it falls apart. Now we could have two sorts of responses: someday we could find the actual model, or all our models must be imperfect approximations. But if science is supposed to be everything we know about the cosmos, and the cosmos is all there is, etc, then I hate to say it, but certainty about anything becomes impossible. We could all just be being fooled by the true conceptual model, namely, a clever space demon controlling our minds to make us think we are getting closer to the reality in our approximations. So even to say that what we see are anything but illusions of illusions of illusions ad infinitum, even like Russian nesting dolls, we have to (gasp!) step outside the mode we have of studying the physical universe into the question of our most general principles and into whether we can know what is closest to us with certainty. In other words, science not only depends on philosophy, it braces itself on it like a man on a life raft in the Pacific. It is thus interesting to me how people answer this. ",

            "answer_text": "Some have answered this question well on Quora. So too does Neil deGrasse Tyson. Here is my overview of the question. It's a philosophical defense of science that also addresses the question of Truth. Science, I believe, is historically a subset of philosophy. Scientists measure objects, energy fields, heat and other things they have access to through their senses. They don't measure spirits and angels. Their measuring involves mathematics, but if they are philosophically sound, in my opinion, they don't confuse abstractions with concrete reality outside their heads. A part of science is verification, as when we conclude that the person approaching is or is not someone we know. Knowledge often involves a complexity of associations and there is always the question of whether we should postpone a conclusion. (Darwin's theory of evolution didn't include later knowledge about evolutionary genetics.) Scientists don't wait until they have \"the whole truth\" because they believe (as I do) that we are incapable of knowing the whole truth. Scientists are openminded about possible corrections or improvements to their conclusions. They think of their theories as working approximations. We can point to a lot of erroneous science from a century or two ago, on race and some other matters. (I include some of Freud's work with this, work dismissed today by psychologists and neuroscientists as faulty. And there is Marx's theory built on faulty data and assumption of a long-run working class impoverishment in industrialized societies.) But because of the openness by good scientists to new data and new theorizing, science, I believe, can be labeled as progressive. Science moves on \u2013 an improvement over fantasy, wishful thinking, and dogma. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is not a set of knowledge as many seem to be saying. It is a process of finding out things in the world by experimenting.  When you tweak the style of your cooking based on how it appeals to others, you are doing science.  When you spar in martial arts, figuring out which techniques you're actually able to execute in chaotic situations against competitive opponents, you are doing science.  When you call someone out on their supposed ability to tell the difference between two things, and give them a blind test to see if they can really tell the difference, you are doing science.  Science goes hand in hand with statistics. There are varying levels of robustness when practicing science. For example, if I think I have ESP and can see cards before they're shown to me, and I find I can correctly actually guess cards correctly more often than I should by chance, I could calculate the percent chance my success was a fluke or a real trend. This p value is likely to be very weak if I did (for example) 1 correct guess in a total of 4 trials. But if I did 250 correct guesses out of a total of 1,000 trials, it would imply that there is definitely something more than random chance happening (either I have ESP, or the experiment was designed in a way that allowed me to cheat). I believe a lot of people who believe in mysticism and pseudoscience can greatly benefit from an education on these simple statistics concepts.  ",

The term science is derived from conscience (rational feel of truth), no relation with descriptions or concepts, as we all have been teached in schools. Conscience is only derived from rational and repetitive thought, therefore it can't use languages (mathematics), experiments or conceptual theories. All we have calling today as science is pure useless garbage, it has nothing to do with science, maybe with technology, but we also know that technology isn't science at all. Science is needed to give logical and rational explanations for example, how gravity, magnetism or electricity works, without using concepts as particles, waves, spacetime, energy, plasma and so on to the trash. Unfortunately science is completely dead, it became a religious belief and the so-called \u201cscientists\u201d of today only waste their time writing non-sense papers, throwing millions of electrical energy and oil into the garbage (CERN, LHC, LIGO\u2026) and creating new bogus terms and concepts to describe virtual particles and parallel dimensions, which again doesn't explain anything, just DESCRIBE some CONCEPT created within his theories.

And the important thing to keep in mind is that this method, if honestly followed, works better than anything else we've ever come up with.

In the modern context (for approximately 3/4 century), science is \u201cthe study of physical processes (called phenomena) through the use of the scientific method.\u201d Applying this to energy, space, and time, we get physics. Applying this to life, we get biology. There are many more foci for science when used in this context. So, the scientific method works as a filter, using positivism (that which can be measured) to permit phenomena which we can apply, and verificationism (that which produces accurate prediction) to filter the results of observations. We leave the interpretations of said results to philosophy, but use the results themselves to generate models. More specifically, the scientific method works like this: formulate a conjecture, make a prediction (hypothesis), devise repeatable experiments to test said prediction, analyse the results, and throw out hypotheses that fail to predict the results. This means, we will always be revising the working hypotheses (which we call theories).  On to the original definition, and why it's important. Science originally meant \u201cknowledge\u201d. More specifically, it was the culmination of knowledge for a specific discipline. This is important if you ever talk about the formal sciences, computer science, political science, and when people talk about things like astrology as a science (nowadays, astrology is a pseudoscience according to modern definitions). So, care when the word science gets used around you to know what the speaker meant, AND whether or not they know about the definitions at all. ",

            "answer_text": "If I may expand a bit on Robert Frost's answer.... Science is a process through which we acquire knowledge.   Is Biology a science?  Is Chemistry a science?  We commonly refer to them that way, (and it's reflected in the dictionary), but technically speaking, they are areas of scientific study.  You've heard that before, right?  It's not just a hoity-toity way of saying it; scientists use that language to be precise.   It is important not to confuse a body of knowledge with the science .  Once you abandon science's tendency to challenge everything we know, and start to revere knowledge for knowledge's sake, you enter the realm of dogma.  Dogma is anti-science.  (\"Scientific dogma\" is an oxymoron, but it happens).   And that is the essence of the conflict between religion and science.  Religion says, \"this is how it is, and that's that.\"  Science challenges.   Spirituality is not the same thing as religion.  Is there a contradiction between spirituality and science?  Some describe it this way:  a belief in God or a higher being is a matter of faith.  Science, on the other hand, is evidence-based.  Not a conflict per se; they simply do different things.  Science cannot comment on the existence of God without evidence.   Perhaps I'll write more and append it as a comment to this entry. ",

It is done through observation of natural phenomena, and/or through experimentation that tries to simulate natural processes under controlled conditions. (There are, of course,more definitions of .)     Consider some examples. An ecologist observing the territorial behaviors of bluebirds and a geologist examining the distribution of fossils in an outcrop are both scientists making observations in order to find patterns in natural phenomena. They just do it outdoors and thus entertain the general public with their behavior. An astrophysicist photographing distant galaxies and a climatologist sifting data from weather balloons similarly are also scientists making observations, but in more discrete settings.      The examples above are observational science, but there is also experimental science. A chemist observing the rates of one chemical reaction at a variety of temperatures and a nuclear physicist recording the results of bombardment of a particular kind of matter with neutrons are both scientists performing experiments to see what consistent patterns emerge. A biologist observing the reaction of a particular tissue to various stimulants is likewise experimenting to find patterns of behavior. These folks usually do their work in labs and wear impressive white lab coats, which seems to mean they make more money too.   ",

            "answer_text": "Hi. Here is our take on understanding science! [1] Ever wondered \u201cWhat is Science?\u201d The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. Ref - Science | Definition of Science by Lexico To me science is the systematic knowledge on things (living and non-living) gained through observation and experimentation. The word \"science\" comes from the Latin word \"scientia\" meaning knowledge. An individual who practices any branch of science is called a \"scientist\" and they are curious people. Science and scientists respect logical reasoning, and follow the cycle of curiosity and experimenting to understand things. These procedures are known as the scientific method. Let me explain further \u2013 say I am trying to understand \u201cWhat is Climate Change? How it happens? Is it natural or man-made?\u201d so on and so forth. That means I am curious. Curiosity is a desire to understand something and consume information just for the pleasure of doing so. People who have scientific curiosity do this because they take satisfaction in seeing what science does to resolve mysteries. Science-curious people are restless people till they don\u2019t get answers. I believe that we are naturally inquisitive. Unfortunately, by the time we enter school system, we seem to lose this natural curiosity. Here learning becomes equivalent to getting good marks. Another may be parental pressure. By the time we reach college, this natural curiosity seems to be in a 'sleep mode'. The average age of this loss is between 13 and 15. Though I personally feel in this \u201cpush Button\u201d era, the age must be now between 5 \u2013 15 years (citing personal experience only) So how do we satisfy our natural curiosity? There are some methods. These are the essence or soul of science. Without them, there would be no science or scientific discovery Let us understand these one by one \u2013 Research \u2013 systematic investigation into existing or new knowledge to gain further insight about all that is life Scientific discovery \u2013to explain the knowledge gathered through observations gained through previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences. Scientific discovery leads to healthy debates based on observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and new reasoning Laboratory \u2013 facility for science research or experimentation in controlled conditions to measure and record observations. A lab is equipped with {laboratory equipment, scientific instruments and chemical and laboratory glassware}. This is where we focus on at Science Katta Objectivity \u2013 is the process where the scientists must attempt to uncover truth about the natural world, by ensuring to eliminate personal or cognitive biases, emotional involvement, etc. Inquiry \u2013 a process or an act of asking for information. How can we help to re-awake our natural curiosity? I think that being curios will help us to search energetically and responsibly for information We tried to explore, observe and discover solution to our question and we find out some motivation that can explain it. Of course, maybe one or more may be the correct one. Try to analyse what suits you best - 1) Start playing more -There is a mutual relationship with playing, getting dirty (by the way it also helps in boosting your immunity system), using fantasy etc and curiosity. 2) Keeping yourself occupied \u2013 teenage or puberty is a crucial and delicate stage in our life. Our hormones are in a mess and we are trying to understand a lot of things about ourselves. At this stage of our life we need to be active and occupied. Develop a life style that is more productive and keeps you away from gadgets for at least a few hours everyday 3) Internet \u2013 Well, let me again ask you \u201cwhat a \"curiosity\" is?\u201d -it's when you want to know something -it's when you would like to know something -it's when you read for your personal knowledge (like I personally love to read about lives in general) -it's when you search the reason of something So, in the past, we would have to \"try\" to read 3, 4 books or papers, journals, encyclopaedias, before having a satisfactory answer. Today we can everything at a click of a mouse. But are we seeking answers or just information? We are treating \"SEARCH\" as a KEY word. The really hard question is \"How can we help to re-awake the natural curiosity of our students?\" Tip for parents, teachers and educators - reward every student that demonstrate to learn from something that is not the school-book, reward every activity, passion, \"curiosity\" of something that is not only the studying program and learning material. Tell me what you think Happy experimenting!!! Footnotes[1] Buy Laboratory Equipment, Scientific Instruments",

This is basically science at its lowest level, of course, you can take it a step further by inspecting the process of ingestion within the body through observation. In physics, a typical question is, how do we walk. We can explain this in terms of friction, take it a step further as the electromagnetic interactions between your feet and the ground, and support it with mathematical equations, depending on the scale of use. (In terms of friction and reactions for macroscopic use or in terms of electromagnetic theories for microscopic use.) As I'd say. You know science when you see it, which is basically everywhere if you pay close attention, be it in the things making up the world (physics/chemistry/astronomy/cosmology)\u2026and also within you(biology/pharmacy) or your mind(psychology).

This is because science is always practical application of any theoretical conundrum or assertion, which doesn\u2019t draw conclusive summary of its veracity or legitimacy until of course challenged or viewed from the pure scientific standpoint. I concur that science favors physical manifestation of any theoretical beliefs. It sees things from its own spectacle of what scientists believe; to substantiate physical or material world using its own experimental and observational conclusion. Some may say science advocates testable explanation of the material universe. Simplifying-ly science doesn\u2019t give a damn to your self-held belief. It rather accuses your belief as counterfactual of its own practically proven results on the same belief held by you. Quite interestingly, science somehow blames you for being extremely delusional because your belief doesn\u2019t concord to that of the science. Science, in its any given variety or subdivision (e.g. natural science, social science, applied science etc.), always favors empirical observation of the facts. That\u2019s why things like divinity, ghosts, paranormal activities, or any intangible occurrence in our material world lose their ground when analyzed from the scientific standpoint. ",

Different branches of science favor different organizing principles. The \"hard sciences\" (physics especially) favors quantitative measures of nature that can be expressed in terms of mathematical equations. Biology was once about cataloging the diversity of life, although with molecular biology, the focus has shifted to the discovery of mechanisms underlying the physiological functioning of life. Neuroscience, as a branch of biology, catalogs the diversity of phenomena and searches for underlying mechanisms. Psychology and the social sciences search for principles underlying the human condition, both individually and collectively. To gain greater legitimacy within the larger project of science, the social sciences have been moving towards greater use of quantitative measures and experimental methods. Engineering is different from science in that it emphasizes building (construction) rather than the discovery of natural properties and principles (deconstruction). Medicine is different from science in that it focuses on the treatment of physiological suffering. However in these days of evidence-based medicine, scientific principles have become the foundation of medical knowledge.  History is different from science in that it organizes events from the human social past into a framework that emphasizes meaning and understanding rather than quantitative principles. And the list goes on... ",

            "answer_text": "What science means to me is what it is commonly known to be; a process of discovery through nonbaised observation based on the scientific method, which was created in the late 17th century by a Sir Francis Bacon. This method, in a simplified way goes something like this: Natural phenomena is observedA hypothesis explaining the causal relationship between different phenomena is surmisedAn experiment is created where as many variables as possible are eliminated so that the only changing variable is the one you are describing in your hypothesis, which is compared to a \u201ccontrol\u201d that is an object that is kept in its current state to ensure that only the variable you are controlling is the one influencing the experiment.Data is collected based on changes to the object enacted by the variable under our controlData is then compared to the hypothesisRinse and repeat to establish a clear pattern betwrrn the object and variable to ensure nothing else is influencing the experimentEvaluate if your initial hypothesis was correct; if not, use the collected data to construct a new hypothesisIf a hypothesis passes muster a number of times and no new one challenges it, then that hypothesis becomes a theory which is science speak for true. The reason they call it a theory and not a fact is because the scientific method likes to firmly establish that every discovery is falsifiable. So while scientific knowledge in every field is always incomplete in this way, a \u201ctheory\u201d is science would be in common parlance indistinguishable form a fact. ",

            "answer_text": "Science vs Religion has been getting a lot of play time lately. It is unfortunate that most of the time they are played against each other - they shouldn\u2019t be. The fact that they are demonstrates that a lot of people don\u2019t really understand the proper role of Science. Human beings are endowed with a natural curiosity, and we spend a lot of time pondering \u201cthe unseen truth\u201d. We want to understand our universe, and know why things happen. Science is one path that we have found that leads us to know more about that unseen truth. We have created the Scientific Method, which uses accepted tools and processes to build upon the knowledge base. But since Science requires us to form hypotheses based on our current understanding, and then perform experiments which support or disprove those hypotheses, you must keep in mind that Science only deals with things that are measurable. Science is a proven path to find the unseen truth, but it may not be the only path. Religion is another path that some people use to discover the unseen truth. While people of Science may ridicule a person\u2019s religious beliefs because they are based on something that you can\u2019t measure, it doesn\u2019t mean that those religious beliefs are invalid. Science can\u2019t explain everything, and Science has been incredibly wrong in the past (Thank you, Copernicus and Einstein!) You should not try to \u201creconcile\u201d Science and religious beliefs. If you accept that Science only pertains to the things in the universe that are measurable, and Religion pertains to the things that are not measurable, then both can peacefully coexist. Clergy should not speculate about the age of the Earth, and Science should not speculate about the existence of God. Since we all just want to know the truth, let\u2019s all hold hands and get there in a way that we each find personally satisfying. ",

All of those images reflect some aspect of science, but none of them provides a full picture because science has so many facets: These images all show an aspect of science, but a complete view of science is more than any particular instance. Science is both a body of knowledge and a process. In school, science may sometimes seem like a collection of isolated and static factslisted in a textbook, but that's only a small part of the story. Just as importantly, science is also a process of discovery that allows us to link isolated facts into coherent and comprehensive understandings of the natural world.Science is exciting. Science is a way of discovering what's in the universe and how those things work today, how they worked in the past, and how they are likely to work in the future. Scientists are motivated by the thrill of seeing or figuring out something that no one has before.Science is useful. The knowledge generated by science is powerful and reliable.

            "answer_text": "Good Question! The work and the method of scientific thought is to formulate principles and undertake research without reference to God, so that a system of thought from which God is absent becomes the axis on which scientific work turns, causing man to be alienated from whatever lies beyond the scope of that thought. At the same time, man's practical life is inevitably connected with the sciences. The results yielded by empirical knowledge embrace all the material aspects of life, imprisoning man within their four impenetrable walls, and it is hardly possible to find any natural tool among the means of man's life. This necessarily increases man's trust in the sciences and affects his behavior, inducing in him a state of doubt and hesitation. In addition, the beneficial nature of the phenomena investigated by empirical science is tangible and aware to everyone, in sharp contrast to metaphysical questions. Similarly, the material phenomena investigated by empirical science are well-known, whereas the opposite is true in the case of metaphysics. The presentation of religious questions in the incorrect method followed by the medieval church, combined with enmity to all manifestations of science, was the most important factor in making empirical science appear preferable to philosophical and meta- physical concerns. In short, science appeared to be opposed to religion, not parallel to it. Once empirical logic succeeded in pouring all thoughts into its own mould, it colored men's outlook on the world to such a degree that they were convinced that it was the only basis for accepting the truth of a thing. They assigned it supreme authority and considered it impossible to prove the existence of anything imperceptible to the senses. So the empirical scientist, who is unaware of the method of those who know God, accepts and regards as proper, in the course of his life, whatever is compatible with scientific logic and thought. He grants himself the right to deny whatever is incompatible with his scientific method. His method is absolute trust in the experiment and regarding it as the sole proof for the correctness of any deduction. In such a situation, when the whole basis of religious thought is ignored, the scientist finds himself without any principles for interpreting those secondary religious questions which appear in the form of commands and prohibitions. Being totally accustomed to the language of science and dependent on formulae, he is utterly committed to his own method and imagines the binding, simple and straightforward commands of religion to be without content or value. This manner of thought is faulty and incorrect. Although the sciences have complex and extraordinarily precise formulae, the comprehension of which requires profound and difficult study, those same formulae leave the realm of science once they enter our practical lives, distancing themselves from the technical language of the scientists. Were this not to be the case, they would be restricted to scientific and industrial centers, libraries and centers of research. Everyone can make use of such facilities as the telephone and the radio. The same holds true of all scientific tools and instruments. For all their precision and complexity, a little specialized instruction will enable anyone to use them. The specialist and the expert do not pass on their mechanical, technical knowledge to the purchasers of the device; instead, they summarize in a few short sentences the result of the toils endured by the inventors. It is, therefore, unfair and incompatible with scientific logic to attempt to force the commands of religion (which cannot be compressed into a scientific formula, being both simple and universal) into the mould of one's own incorrect prejudices and imaginings, and then pronounce them worthless and insignificant, while ignoring their decisive role and their profound effects in our life. Practical instructions bear their fruit when they are proclaimed in a generally comprehensible language and become tangible for everyone in individual and social life. Furthermore, if it were supposed that the commands and instructions of religions should be determined by our cognition, understanding and taste, there would be no need for revelation and Prophets; we could construct our own religions. Man often overlooks his weaknesses, preoccupied as he is with his strengths. The science worshipper of the contemporary world is so proud of his knowledge as a result of the progress that has been attained in the experimental sciences that he imagines himself to have conquered and triumphantly taken possession of the world of truth. But nobody has ever been able to claim that he has attained knowledge of all the mysteries of the universe and removed all the veils from the world of nature. One must take a broader view of reality and realize how slight is one's own drop of knowledge when compared to the ocean of hidden mysteries that confronts us. In the wake of every scientific discovery, a further series of unknowns comes into view. Throughout the centuries that man has untiringly labored with all his resources to know the world as fully as possible, the only result of his exertions has been the discovery of a few among the many mysteries of the universe. Only a few short steps have been taken on this path, and there is a whole mass of unknowns clustered around human knowledge like a cloud. One must, therefore, assess more realistically the cognitive scope of the sensory sciences and their proper area of activity and influence. All preconceptions that are like barriers on the path to truth must be discarded in favor of a correct analysis. Without doubt, the empirical sciences can inform us only of the external aspects of phenomena; it is only matter and material phenomena that come within the scope of their study and are susceptible to laboratory experimentation. The method of the sciences in attaining their goal, while seeking to benefit from each slight increment in knowledge, is observation and experiment. Since the fundamental concern of the empirical sciences is the investigation of the external world, in order to be sure that a certain scientific theory is correct, we must compare it with the external world to test it. If the external world effectively verifies it, we accept it; if it does not, we do not accept it. So, considering the object and the method of the empirical sciences, we must ask whether metaphysical truths are subject to sensory test and experimentation? Does any empirical enquiry have the right to intervene in matters of faith and belief? Is any part of the experimental sciences concerned with God? To discover the correctness or incorrectness of a matter in the empirical sciences, it is necessary to make use of change and of the elimination of given factors and circumstances. This method is not applicable to the eternal, immutable and supra-material divine existence. Material knowledge is a lamp that can illumine certain unknown matters with its rays but it is not a lamp that can eliminate all darkness. For the knowledge of a system is dependent on comprehension of the whole in its totality and a form of cognition that can unite all partial insights in itself, resulting in a total vision. Now, to imprison human knowledge in the narrow, restrictive confines of the sensory sciences cannot bring man to a total vision, but only to an awareness of empirical phenomena combined with an unawareness of the inner dimension of being. Whether we believe in God or not has, in fact, no connection with the empirical sciences, because since the object of their investigations is matter, the sciences that concern themselves with material phenomena do not have the right to express themselves affirmatively or negatively concerning any non-material subject. According to the belief of religious schools of thought, God is not a body. He cannot be perceived by the senses. He transcends time and place. He is a being Whose existence is not subject to temporal limitation and place cannot restrict him. He is, therefore, free of need and exalted in His essence above any kind of deficiency. He knows the inner as well as the outer aspect of the universe; the world lies open before Him. Finally, He possesses the highest degree of every perfection and is loftier than whatever concerning Him might come to man's mind. We cannot possibly know the ground of His essence, given the inadequacy of ourselves and of our powers, faculties and instruments of discernment. For this reason, if you study all the books of empirical science, you will not find the slightest mention of an experiment concerning God or any judgment offered concerning God. Even if we do regard sense perception as the only means for discovering reality, we cannot prove, relying on sense perception, that nothing exists beyond the world of the senses. Such an assertion would, in itself, be non-empirical, resting on no sensory or empirical proof. Even if the followers of a religious school of thought had no proofs for their claim, to conclude firmly and forcibly that non- being reigns beyond the sensory realm would be a non-scientific choice, based on imagination and speculation. Some people try to propagate this fantasy in the garb of science and to present their choice as having been dictated by scientific thought. In the final analysis, however, the denial involved in such an assertion is unworthy of science and philosophy, and even contradicts empirical logic. In The Elementary Principles of Philosophy, Georges Pulitzer says, \"To imagine a thing that does not occupy time and space and is immune to change and development is an impossibility.\" It is plain that these words reflect a way of thought that does not know what it is searching for. If it knew what it was looking for, it would also understand how to look for it. Since the activity of this mode of thought revolves around nature and the sensory realm, it will naturally regard as impossible whatever lies beyond the scope of its activity and the existence of which cannot be proven by way of sensory experiment. It will regard belief in such an entity as contrary to the scientific mode of thought. However, scholars in the natural sciences are confronted with a whole mass of unknowns concerning this very earth and tangible, lifeless matter, even though they are constantly in touch with it (apart from which the material universe, with its countless mysteries and secrets, does not consist simply of this globe on which we live). Such scholars have, then, the right only to say, \"Since the supernatural realm lies beyond the scope of my professional tools, I remain silent and cannot utter a denial.\" How could they permit themselves to make a claim that would necessitate knowledge as extensive as the scheme of the universe, when their knowledge of the total scheme of being is close to zero? What proof exists to substantiate the claim that being is equivalent to matter and that the whole world of being consists of material entities? What scientist rejecting metaphysics has ever been able to found his denial on logic or proof, or to furnish evidence that beyond absolute non-being, nothing exists outside the seen realm? ***** Although science does not explicitly and definitively reject every unknown thing simply because it can have no access to it by means of its tools and instruments, patiently awaiting instead the day when it should be discovered, materialists do not even approach the question of the existence of God with doubt and hesitation; on the basis of their erroneous and hasty prejudices, they pronounce their judgment that the Creator does not exist. Such persons establish certain criteria and standards for themselves and are not prepared to apply a different criterion established for a definite purpose in a given area. For example, they would never use the criteria applicable to a surface to measure a body, but when it comes to measuring the supra-sensory world, they try to measure God, the spirit, and inspiration, with the same tools they use to measure the material world. When they find themselves unable to gain any knowledge of the entities in question, they proceed to deny their existence. Now, if a person imprisoned in empirical logic desires to accept the reality of the universe only to the extent permitted him by sensory experience and to deny whatever lies beyond that, he must recognize that this is a path he has chosen for himself; it is not the result of scientific investigation and experiment. This kind of pseudo-intellectualism arises from intellectual rebellion and an abandonment of one's original nature. The god that the natural scientist wishes vainly to \"prove\" with his tools and instruments is, in any event, no god at all in the view of those who worship God. Lesson 3: God and Empirical Logic ",

We value honesty in people, and probably with very few exceptions we each one of us perceive ourselves as honest. But people are complicated. Walt Whitman wisely wrote, \u201cDo I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.\u201d But nearly two centuries after Whitman\u2019s birth, we have become uncomfortable with contradictions, not only within scientific fact, but with the personal, the metaphorical. While for centuries people were mostly unfazed by contradictions in the Bible (with no small irony, the Scholastic movement of the late Middle Ages, which sought to iron out those contradictions, laid the logical foundation for modern science), today people lose their mind if a movie based upon a comic book differs in modest detail from the source material.

To some extent that\u2019s true\u2013we lie to our loved ones, we lie to ourselves\u2013and yet it\u2019s also trying to impose a rigid, science-inspired, axiomatic framework on goopy, non-axiomatic people, House being a premiere example of that attitude.

And then: The veracity of a scientific statement is determined by the quantity and quality of the experimental evidence. Questions about the quality of the science are questions about the experiments. Are they repeatable? Are they numerous? Are they tortured by statistical algorithms that stretch belief? Are the statements so abstract that only about 3 people in the world really know what is being postulated? Are the people posing the scientific statements prepared to be wrong? Or are they using politics, religion, or other human coercions to bully you into believing their \u201cscience\u201d? Science was developed in the 17th century as a response to what happened to Galileo. The motto \u201cnullius in verba\u201d was used to separate science from the Church and the King and charlatans who tried to bully you into believing. This motto means: on the word of no man. If you claim a scientific statement, do it. Repeat it. Welcome challenges. Look for errors, don\u2019t hide them. Don\u2019t lie. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is an organized body of truth regarding some special object of thought. Today it refers to the natural sciences which deals with the objects of sense. Aristotle considers the why of science when he states that science is not just a fact but a reasoned fact.. Science may also be defined as an intellectual habit of certain and evident knowledge of universal being, which is gained through demonstration. We say certain to distinguish it from opinion, which is uncertain, and by saying evident we distinguish it from faith, which is an inevident assent. It's object must be universal for we can only have certain knowledge of what is essential to a thing. Now essences are universal and necessary in the sense they cannot change. In Newton's view science is a systematic account of phenomena, expressed in mathematical terms, and interpreted sccording to mathematical law. The truth of a theory or law is to be judged by is applicability to a range of phenomena, by its self-consistecy, and by its simplicity. These may be fulfilled more or less at any moment. Physical science cannot give an account of the material world as a whole but only to that aspect which is amenable to mathematical treatment. A physico-mathematical theory be said to be true if it is self-consistent, and is the simplest possible scheme of mathematical concepts and explanatory entities which is exactly applicable, from the point of view of measurement, to all the phenomena which have been observed at any given moment.

Empiric science is based on real world observations and it more or less shows the evidence based folks where to aim their guns. The main flaw of empirical science is that looks can be deceiving. The main flaw of evidence based science is that studies can only look at limited variables in a research project and there are many important variables that we don\u2019t know about. And don't forget about common sense. It is comprised of eons of observations in the real world.

            "answer_text": "I think it's helpful to think of science as \"knowledge\" rather than a certain method of obtaining knowledge--because there is more than one way of getting information than simply relying on \"the scientific method.\" I'm a science teacher; I teach the scientific method; so, I'm aware of its weaknesses. Etymologically, \"science\" comes from a term that means \"to cut.\" This suggests that science was primarily a means of gaining knowledge--\"to know via cutting/dissection\"--which makes a lot of sense to me (a physician and science teacher). Historically, however, it has been synonymous with \"knowledge,\" the end goal of the scientific pursuit. The primacy of science as knowledge over science as method can be seen in how theology used to be called \"the queen of the sciences.\" Theology has never been known to be an experimental endeavor. It's all about knowing, not doing. Theology could never have been called a science unless it were thought of as a noun (a kind of knowledge) instead of a verb (a means of obtaining knowledge). This all goes to say that experiential/experimental data is not the only way of obtaining truth. One must rely on second-hand knowledge--knowledge given to us from reliable sources--almost all the time. Even scientists rely on data given to them from other scientists. As proof, think of this: if one were never to trust authorities, a person would have to redo every important experiment himself. Obviously, this would never be possible. ",

That inquisitive look on a child's face demonstrates an innate capacity for scientific thought.

This is not to say the average person cannot think scientifically.  We all have the capacity to rationally question our world, though some of us do have greater influence than others.  When that influence is coupled with ground-breaking ideas, revolutions in scientific thought can occur upon which subsequent new technologies and industries can be based. That is science.  It is an innate human capacity refined by education, sharpened by social competition as well as cooperation, and is the hallmark of free thinking societies worldwide.  It is the best method we currently have of understanding our world and our universe.  Through science we shine a light on the unknown, replace awe with actionable data, and increase our collective knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "Science means the perfect unbiased analysis of all the items and concepts of the imaginable creation. We welcome science as far as the path of the analysis is concerned. At the end, the right conclusion should be drawn and some scientists draw the wrong conclusion, which is in the opposite direction to the right conclusion. Science is like the straight tusk of the tree and these two conclusions are like the two branches generating from the tip of the tusk in the opposite directions. We also travel along the tusk in line with the atheists. We differ from the atheist at the end of the analysis only. Atheists take the direction of the wrong conclusion and we take the direction of the right conclusion. Our right conclusion is that no item of this imaginary creation is God and no concept related to this creation can be the concept of God. The wrong conclusion of the atheists is that nothing exists beyond this imaginable creation and hence God does not exist. We use the analysis of science to negate every item of the creation to be God (Neti Neti-Veda). Science is the indirect knowledge of God by which we reject the entire creation to be God and conclude that God, the creator, is beyond the creation. The direct knowledge of God is that God is beyond this creation and more than this no information of God is possible. We can show you what is not God and we cannot show you what is God. Space is the first item of the creation, which is not the absence of any imaginable item. Space is only very subtle invisible energy. Bend of space spoken in science proves this. There cannot be bending of nothing. God is the generator of this space or subtle energy. Veda says that God is generator of space and in another place says that God is the generator of energy. Both these statements are one and the same since space is subtle energy. The generator of space cannot have space in it. This means that there is no space in God. This results in saying that God is beyond spatial dimensions. We can never imagine that, which has no spatial dimensions. Hence, God is unimaginable. The atheist may ask proof for the existence of unimaginable and say that unimaginable without proof does not exist. One proof is the existence of unimaginable events called miracles in this world. The atheist may discard this proof saying that the miracle is only magic. The magic looks like miracle but on deep observation and analysis can be disproved. But, there are certain unimaginable events, which cannot be disproved even on deepest observations and deepest analysis. The atheist says that the magic of yesterday called as miracle is proved today and hence all the miracles will be proved as magic by tomorrow. But, this tomorrow never comes since the atheist is not stipulating the time gap for this tomorrow. Yesterday, you could not touch the roof of the house by your hand. Today, you touched the roof by practicing the high jump. Based on this, you are saying that you will continue the practice of high jump and touch the sky by tomorrow. We have experienced the today, which is present after the past yesterday, but this tomorrow is never experienced by us even though we waited up to the end of our life. Your promise of the time gap has utterly failed. The reason is that the sky can never be touched by you. But the roof is touched by you because it is touchable after certain practice. Today, you can touch the upper horizontal log of the door even without practice. By this, you can conclude three categories: a) touchable today, b) touchable by tomorrow after certain efforts and c) untouchable on any day. The three corresponding items of the creation to the above three categories are: a) visible-imaginable, b) invisible-imaginable and c) invisible-unimaginable. The ordinary person belongs to the first item. The scientist belongs to the second item. The philosopher belongs to the third item. If you are not willing to accept the genuine miracles, there is one outstanding miracle, which is beyond your understanding. You cannot deny this since it is referred by science as infinity. This creation or universe is infinite with unimaginable boundary. This is practically experienced through not only our eyes but also through your powerful telescopes. You have to accept the existence of unimaginable indicated by the word infinite. This universe is created by God, which is emerged from the God. When you touch the boundary of this imaginable universe, it means, you have touched the unimaginable God. There are only two items here. One is the unimaginable God and the other is the imaginable universe. The joint line between these two items cannot be a third item, which is different from the two items since only two items exist. Hence the end of one item means the beginning of the other item. When you have reached the end of the ocean, you have touched the beginning of the land. Therefore, if you have reached the end of imaginable universe, you must touch the beginning of unimaginable God. Since unimaginable can never be touched by anybody, which is even beyond imagination, it means that you can never reach the end of the imaginable universe. This is a practical scientific example that has to be accepted by any human being as a proof for the existence of the unimaginable, which is called by the word \u2018God\u2019 by us. Once the atheist accepts the unimaginable God, further extensions of this concept like human incarnation etc can be easily introduced. When God has unimaginable nature or capability to do any unimaginable action, such unimaginable God enters a specific human form for a specific program like preaching the spiritual knowledge that gives right direction for the spiritual aspirants to become human incarnation. When the capability of the unimaginable God cannot be questioned, you cannot oppose the probability of the concept of human incarnation of God especially when there is a genuine need. Hence, the establishment of the concept of unimaginable God is the main effort and other concepts become easy. Hence, Shankara tried to establish the existence of God in the minds of the atheists. Further concepts of worship of God etc were easily established by the followers like Ramanuja and Madhva. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is often counterintuitive. Small invisible creatures live on your food, giant metal cylinders fly through the air, magnets synchronize electrons, human gradually evolved from small mammals, which in turns evolved from fish and so on back to the first replicating molecule. Water defies gravity inside trees, the inner workings of illusions, atom bombs demonstrate a type of energy that hold everything together, and lastly, your mind is created by microscopic cells, that don\u2019t know who you are or cares. That is called the scientific images, because it draws upon all the scientific discoveries of stuff our ancestors didn\u2019t knew existed. Philosophy draws the common sense understanding of the world together with the scientific understanding of the worlds. The goal of philosophy is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term. This job description results in, that the philosopher often confronts the problem of - who do you believe, me or your lying eyes? \u2013 \u201cWe learn to take it that sticks appearing bent while partially immersed in water should in fact be judged straight. We learn not to suppose that the moon is larger when near the horizon than when higher in the sky.\u201d As Quine said in the web of beliefs. The existence of a manifestation of the color red in front of your eye, is hard to argue with. But sometimes seeing red, doesn\u2019t mean that there is a red object you are seeing, since it might be your brain playing a trick on you. Try this after image effect and see that color maybe isn\u2019t what you think it is. Look at the picture for 30 seconds and then look at a white back ground.  We call people that have a common sense understanding of the world, for na\u00efve realists. They see the world as it is, and don\u2019t question the obvious reality. If they see red, something red out there must exist. All these beliefs are called the manifest image, and they sometimes clash with the scientific image as the example above shows. This belief in all they see what there is, and it works remarkably well. When it comes to surviving and reproducing, the truth falls short, compared a useful illusion. That\u2019s why na\u00efve realism was the mind set held by most of our ancestors. Trying to understand how things work is a modern luxury. The na\u00efve realist\u2019s ontology contains things such as, sun sets, opportunities, colors, piles, love, words, consciousness, free will, and other everyday objects. It is basically all what everyone knows at the age of six. Not everyone thinks this dovetailing the scientific image with the manifest image is a good idea. Politicians, religious people, post modernists and ardent na\u00efve realists are some of the opponents of an examined life. They suffer from a premature curiosity satisfaction. They conjure up an excuse, which allow them to stop thing. This mysterious approach to life is the spell is broken by philosophy together with science. That was something about the interface between science and regular people. But how does science work? Science is creating bricks, which fit with the giant house of scientific discoveries. Science is to place a word in an ever-expanding cross-word puzzle. Science follows the scientific method, when it creates these bricks or words for the scientific image. For instance, give high fructose sugar to a bunch of humans and measure them in every possible way. Then compare it to a group which carefully removed that kind of sugar from their diet. Or take a litter of babies and rise them in a pack of wolves and compare it to children raised in a normal hunter-gatherer environment. In the biological sciences it\u2019s difficult to find the normal control group. Imagine, if you don\u2019t know the environment in which an airplane is meant to be, then you can perform a million experiments under water, which don\u2019t show how the plane actually should work. This underwater-airplane knowledge can live up to all the scientific criteria, but doesn\u2019t explain anything about the real function of air-planes. Science also looks for necessary and sufficient conditions, which seldom is practical. But what it lacks behind in practically it catches up with in truth. Necessary and sufficient condition can be represented with a Venn-diagram. Here\u2019s one for pancakes. It\u2019s necessary to use eggs, but not sufficient.  Another example of the finding the necessary and sufficient condition of a good cookie is this Cookie Perfection Machine. Was is a bad batch of cookies? Then add some more baking soda, sugar, salt, and flour in the next batch, and then they might turn out fine. You might end up with good cookies, but the truth eludes you. You don\u2019t know what made the difference. Was it the pinch of salt or a stick of butter? But who cares? Scientists, like this cookie engineer, do. Hold everything constant in you experiment and turn the knob slightly on one variable. The sufficient condition is called multiple realizability. There are often many ways you can solve the same problem. If you want to see, it\u2019s sufficient to evolve eyes, sonar, radar, or Electroreception. If you want to make a piercing weapon, you can evolve claws, horns, spikes, beaks, fangs, and knifes. The necessary condition is called a forced move. It\u2019s in something you can\u2019t get around, if you want to reach a certain goal. If you want to pass your genes on, it\u2019s necessary you find energy, have a membrane, and replicate. If you want to describe the essence of a bee, it\u2019s necessary that is yellow, black, flies, stings, buzzes, etc. But category membership is often better described with fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic say nothing that is necessary for being a bee, but you can be a more a less generic bee. Once a bee existed, that hadn\u2019t evolved all the structures moderns bees have in common. You can either say it wasn\u2019t a bee, which is a essentialist mind set. But essentialism in biology is close to an death sin, because all animals are offshoots in the tree of life, and have the same grand grand grand\u2026 mother, if we go way back. The other possibility is called gradualism, where you use fuzzy logic and say it was sorta a \u201cbee\u201d. The \u201csorta\u201d operators indicate the meaning of the word bee have been starched. The word \u201cBee\u201d now contain the primordial bees, which gradually evolved into modern bees. If a word becomes to fuzzy it loses all meaning, but there is no need for sharp edges of necessary and sufficient condition. Another important concept in the scientific image is vertical integration, the jumping together of science. The vertical integration of science tries to fix the different scientists ontology together. One level of description takes over, when the one above or below stops. We reason with a different ontology according to the level of explanation. Just think of concepts such as oxygen atom, sugar molecule, blood cell, your sex-drive, chair, city, planet, and the universe. ",

The fathers of science are many, let\u2019s say that the first one are Galileo Galilei and Ren\u00e9 Descartes. They both cut the world in primary and secondary properties (this was not a new thing btw but it is fundamental). The first properties were basically SPACE, we can measure the lenght of a ship, to say. But what about the color? Color is just the experience of an observer. The great step forward was mathematizing nature, and discovering that we can measure pretty everything. So the color become a light frequency.Of course the inner experience of RED COLOR will always be differente from one man to another, but we have a shared data about the kind of light coming from red surfaces.THIS OPENED THE WORLD. And Galileo was the first to even introduce a relativity theory, obviously not about space-time, but about differen systems of observation, and Einstein himself will use his thoughts.Natural Philosophy became Science when we started using heavily math and THE EXPERIMENTAL METHOD. Note that also Aristotle and fellows did accurate observations of nature, but they did not make experiment in the modern way: recreating a nature situation controlled in a lab and measuring all the parametres. Is Science true? Well as long as he came out from philosophy, truth is still the goal of Science. But more than its Mother, Science collect data. After the collection, data are organized in theories, that must have the power of logically and rationally explain most of possible of nature reality. So the data, if taken with perfect instruments and perfect environment, can be considered true, but still we must build a theory or we just won\u2019t understand scientifical data. So in the building of theory, scientist must do again some philosophy. You can find this in the long dispute about reality between Einstein and Bohr or the multiple interpretations that scientist arbitrally (to say their own convinctions) adobte for quantum mechanic. ",

All of those images reflect some aspect of science, but none of them provides a full picture because science has so many facets: Science is both a body of knowledge and a process. In school, science may sometimes seem like a collection of isolated and static factslisted in a textbook, but that's only a small part of the story. Just as importantly, science is also a process of discovery that allows us to link isolated facts into coherent and comprehensive understandings of the natural world.Science is exciting. Science is a way of discovering what's in the universe and how those things work today, how they worked in the past, and how they are likely to work in the future. Scientists are motivated by the thrill of seeing or figuring out something that no one has before.Science is useful. The knowledge generated by science is powerful and reliable. It can be used to develop new technologies, treat diseases, and deal with many other sorts of problems.Science is ongoing. Science is continually refining and expanding our knowledge of the universe, and as it does, it leads to new questions for future investigation. Science will never be \"finished.\"Science is a global human endeavor. People all over the world participate in the process of science. And you can too!",

            "answer_text": "The Science Disaster We have excluded every organism of the Biosphere as a partner in perception. We assume that they are less intelligent and are not capable of the meritorious thinking with which we credit ourselves. As a result we have excluded nature itself from our partnership in perception. We have not even conceptualized on the need, to evolve a language that includes the understanding mechanism of every organism. There is in fact the common language in the shape of air, where one can perceive in revelations by breathing,smelling,sensing,understand,interact,harmonize,cooperate,coordinate,cater,predict and learn along with other organisms, realizing the reality of one as the macro body as Gaia. In science partnership with Gaia which creates the emotional bonds is bias to be avoided. The lifeless machine, that just has no emotions, that does not participate in the continuous change as nature in evolution, the static thing, is the ideal of science! Science today is removing every aspect of nature and creating a machine to substitute. Nature is being cyborged after hundreds of organisms are killed. It is fast converting earth into a dead planet. All of us know the Technology is causing the extinction of the biosphere, that land, water and air are poisoned continuously, but still disabled ourselves from taking the basic steps to save nature. We are drifting helplessly and we call that drift itself progress. We have advanced in the lunacy so much that everyone who wants to be fancied as a thinker (tinker?) and intellectual, cannot even dare to say that science is mankind\u2019s lunacy. YM Saving a Revelation This is the age of indifference. None can feel and know by breathing. The flow of revelations from nature as the essential part of life, died. The very source of revelations, the symbiotic nature, is killed. Belief and faith have become impossible. May be, the discovery or guesswork, that our Milky Way itself is in a big Black Hole, is true. All revelations from nature are sucked away, creativity, suffocated. Life no longer is a voyage of revelations and discoveries, the thrill of feeling as knowing. You are just a customer in market for the manufactured products, for the manufactured music, for the manufactured arts. Nature is continuously killed. In the remaining nature, which is just waiting for its turn to be made extinct, revelations, very rarely happen. But they are at the individual level, the Biosphere as a macro body is extinct today. There is no one to breathe symbiotically the individual revelation and convert it into a flow of feelings and emotions. The air has become a collection of molecules without the capacity to create revelations. Inventions ousted or eliminated the flow of discoveries and revelations. Machines and machines, chemicals and chemicals, poisons and poisons, have become the science advancements. The natural emanation of breathing the healthy air in lush nature, the flow of symbiotic emotions, the revelations and discovery laden revelations are dubbed as bias. Even under these hopeless conditions, if one determinedly extracts revelations by breathing, and publishes it, automatically it gets bracketed with some ism or cult, robbing the revelation and originality of its basic character as the new and fresh.. It is made into a copy without originality. Some know all, may then comment or discourse or write not about the new revelations but about the ism or cult into which the revelation is fixed. Revelations are not recognized but buried in something already established, today. This is not the age of revelations from nature, but only the age of mechanical inventions, mathematical reduction, and destruction of nature. Nature can give revelations, only if allowed to live.

Science is experiment and observation connected to the technological revolution and the class struggle of humankind. Without philosophical materialism, as Dialectical Historical Quantum Materialistic Thought , it becomes a tool of the Ruling class. With it, it becomes the ideological outlook of the revolutionary proletariat . Science is therefore the ideology of the Ruling class. In every book on western philosophy, we see that science, which is based upon observational facts and experimentational facts, is an ideological tool of the Ruling class ideology to defend their State power and the civil society superstructure built up by that State power. Laws of science are based on Laws of Nature, which, since Heraclitus and Democritus of Abdera, has been based upon phenomenal matter moving in a mental representation of space and time as a nothingness (vacuum) . It\u2019s overthrew the ancient materialism of the Ionian philosophy, created the opiate of the masses in religion as a defense, and science religion as the basis of class dominance.

The heart of the process is the scientific method. This method is one of the most powerful tools ever created by mankind. It is self disciplining in that it unhesitatingly dismisses information proven to be wrong. It is the method by which theories are scrutinized, tested, and developed, often as successive approximations to the truth. Once a theory successfully and spectacularly explains the aspect of nature with which it is concerned, it can graduate, so to speak, to scientific fact, even though it always retains the title theory. Even such successful theories however, are still open to adjustment by the development information. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. In an older and closely related meaning, \"science\" also refers to this body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. Ever since classical antiquity, science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to philosophy. In the West during the early modern period the words \"science\" and \"philosophy of nature\" were sometimes used interchangeably,and until the 19th century natural philosophy (which is today called \"natural science\") was considered a branch of philosophy. In modern usage \"science\" most often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge, not only the knowledge itself. In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature. Over the course of the 19th century, the word \"science\" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself, as a disciplined way to study the natural world, including physics, chemistry, geology and biology. It is in the 19th century also that the term scientist began to be applied to those who sought knowledge and understanding of nature. Modern science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material world, the social sciences which study people and societies, and the formal sciences like mathematics. The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations. Disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences.

An interesting question is, if water always runs downhill what controls the flow rate of water running downhill? After a long process of formulating and testing hypotheses, during ancient Greek period, accurate mathematical formulas were developed predicting the flow rates and noting that they depended on area of the flow channel, roughness of the channel, and slope of the channel, The greeks and romans developed this science into a practical engineering system that could, and still does supply cities with fresh water.

As such, it provides descriptive and explanatory models and theories, that may (but not always) prove useful in producing predictions.In addition, and that is an essential difference between Science and, say, Religion or other speculative activities such as metaphysics, Science is guided by a method (\"Scientific Method\")  of accumulating knowledge by continuously challenging the models and theories it produces against Observable Facts.The Scientific Method is found on sound Reasonning based on logics, a particular branch of Mathematics. Another fundamental guideline for reasonning scientifically is to avoid unnecessary hypothesis as much as possible (i.e. Occam's Razor)In particular: science is not a unique source of Truth. Science produces models and theories that may be challenged and later on, changed to more adequate ones. However, the later principles may apply: a model is considered \"valid\" if no observable fact (at the current time) proves it otherwise. Thus, results brought by Science are not and may not be proven as true, but only judged acceptable as not being proved wrong at a given time. In particular: in order to work that way, practionners in the field of Science (\"Scientists\") MUST share their findings and challenge with each other.  Also: mathematics are not science. There are no observable facts to be challenged against. However, maths are widely used by science. Also: engineering of all sort is not Science, but Technique. It also follows a rational process of building knowledge, but generally differs in its objectives, often leaving the descriptive or explanatory  in favor of the capability to predict. F. ",

These things are scientifically accurate and proved in our own generation to be true. They are also hard evidence that the both the Bible and God are true for anyone who doubts.

It includes finding reasons for phenomena, the course of a phenomenon, or a phenomenon itself. Since it is derived from the Latin word meaning knowledge, it includes acquiring all information about about a certain specimen. You have general science which is subject of its own, but you also have a science for other things(social science, the science of mathematics,home science) , because everything has its basis in existence. All in all, it is a systematic study of an event made in order to predict the courses of similar events in future. Alternative answer: A subject in high school which you can choose if you are interested. ",

Quantum Bayesianism theorizes that reality adjusts to our expectations. The roots of QBISM are in the Copenhagen interpretation. The Copenhagen convention was convened to try to understand how one experiment could prove that light was made of particles while another experiment proved that it was made of waves. The consensus interpretation was that reality is constructed out of the expectations built into each experiment. QBISM is the formal application of this interpretation. ",

Accumulation of knowledge attempts to uncover TRUTHS (facts + reasonable conclusions). The correct process follows a step-wise set of activities that arises with a guess or question based on what you already know or have reasonable evidence to highly suspect. The process then conducts experiments to gather DATA, that is subsequently used to either support or refute the original guess. So, science is NOT purpose-driven; it\u2019s blind to outcomes during the phase of data collection. Moreover, science does NOT interpret the data with an agenda, other than to cleanly, objectively, truthfully draw reasonable conclusions from the data. ",

Concepts of looking at the very large and very small, as well as the intermediate have existed at least since Ancient Greece. When a new category is added to macro-, meso-, micro-, we will get a new type of science. Meanwhile, we can work with the physics of the small to create the metaphysics of the large, and the functions and paradigms of the middle. Knowledge comes in at every level, and exits through new categories. Aristotle's posterior analytics seems to suggest that new categories or proofs are the output, because producing old categories with new categories is more boring. But, sometimes it isn't, and then everything can be structured in New knowledge, like the Copornican Revolution. In a way both methods are analytic, one prior (deduction) and one post (Copornican).

Technology , on the other hand is the application of science to transform nature in the desired direction satisfying the will of human beings & this results in a new Product/process from natural resources. So , science is the activity of unfolding the secrets of nature. If the relevant aspects of nature are not fully understood, this unsolved problem acts as a driving force for science & helps in finding a quick solution for the scientific truth. Water flows from uphill to downhill is the scientific observation. If you wan t to prevent the flow of water from rivers into sea & getting wasted , you have to build a damn across the river - to make use of the river water from getting wasted into sea. For this , you have to build a damn. Building a damn is Technology. Converting the direction of flow of water through canals is Technology. Like this , for every scientific finding , you can convert that scientific finding into technology to make it more & directly useful to the mankind at large. I hope I have made your point clear.

It is the label we put on our combined efforts to learn and better understand our natural world. Scientific theories are explanations that describe observations and natural phenomena. If observations change or become richer, so does the theory need to change. What matters is observation and evidence. The more we learn, the more we usually realize how little we knew before. Science and the scientific method is a continually improving and ever-changing voyage towards knowledge and betterment. Its inherent structure understands that nothing is perfect, except observations and data. This is how we learn. ",

            "answer_text": "Science (from Latin scientia, meaning \"knowledge\") is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictionsabout the universe. This article is about the general term. For other uses, see Science (disambiguation). Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences, which study the material universe; the social sciences, which study people and societies; and the formal sciences, which study logic and mathematics. The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations. Disciplines which use science, like engineering and medicine, may also be considered to be applied sciences. From classical antiquity through the 19th century, science as a type of knowledge was more closely linked to philosophy than it is now, and in the Western world the term \"natural philosophy\" once encompassed fields of study that are today associated with science, such as astronomy, medicine, and physics. However, during the Islamic Golden Age foundations for the scientific method were laid by Ibn al-Haytham in his Book of Optics. While the classification of the material world by the ancient Indians and Greeks into air, earth, fire and water was more philosophical, medieval Middle Easterns used practical and experimental observation to classify materials. In the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of physical laws. Over the course of the 19th century, the word \"science\" became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world. It was during this time that scientific disciplines such as biology, chemistry, and physics reached their modern shapes. That same time period also included the origin of the terms \"scientist\" and \"scientific community\", the founding of scientific institutions, and the increasing significance of their interactions with society and other aspects of culture.

Astrology, Marxism, Philosophy, (maybe even \"Political Science\"), Poetry aren't sciences (which is not to say that they aren't important or, in some cases as important). There are different ideas why these aren't sciences (some might argue that astrology, for instance, is a science - but we all know it isn't :-)  ). Testability, repeated testability, predictability, falsifiability, simplicity, etc. may be some criteria to demarcate what is science and what isn't.

Does poetry provide superficial and not \"real\" knowledge? I have to admit, I find it a very tough question to answer. ",

What I find somewhat disheartening is the fact that not enough people study science in order to benefit from it in their everyday lives.  Also, politics could really benefit from a healthy injection of science.  However, the general public would also have to understand the science in order to make better political decisions.  ",

This understanding can be pursued by direct observation of how things behave under different circumstances, forming hypotheses about why things behave the way they do, and creating experiments attempting to disprove those hypotheses. A theory that we haven't been able to disprove may be considered a scientific fact until proven otherwise. A key rigor of science is repeatability. Any scientific data should be able to be replicated by anyone with the resources to do the experiment or observation, and the conclusions should be reasonable to all objective people. This definition tends to separate \"hard\" sciences, such as chemistry and physics, from \"soft\" sciences such as psychology or political science. In the latter, there are so many factors and variables that observations are often difficult to repeat and conclusions are hard to make in any absolute sense. ",

The more data the hypothesis explains with the fewer assumptions, the more robust hypothesis. They try to disprove the hypothesis. This is important. You can never definitively prove a hypothesis. In this sense all scientific knowledge carries a degree of uncertainty. Your experiment can take the general form of \u201cIf the hypothesis is true, then if we do A we would expect B. If you do A and you get B, then you have failed to prove your hypothesis false, and you can conduct another experiment. You make results known so that others can criticize and benefit from your experiment. Science is inherently a communal project. If not disproven, over time the hypothesis may be refined and treated as a theory. Note that Einstein did not base his famous theories on experimental data, but on thought experiments. His explanations were valued because of their simplicity and robustness. Years or decades later experiments were devised to test them. Darwin did not really conduct experiments. Rather, he gathered massive amounts of data and developed a few simple principles to explain them all. New data continue to support his explanation. The amazing thing with Darwin is that genetics was unknown when he wrote The Origin of Species. He did not know the device through which evolution worked, but he explained how it worked. ",

The one that the western culture uses is called Western Science, this is the science that people learn in schools, it is the so called proven science that proves something to exist by using the methods employed of finding the how, what and where of things in the universe. This science is one that picks everything apart, dissecting everything to know its true nature. What and how they are looking at it determine the reality. The other science which exists is called the Real Science, this science has existed since the beginning of the creation of life. This science doesn't question the existence of the universe, it doesn't question weather or not it is alive, or does not question how all the little parts work for there is no need to. It's intent is to help for the purpose of existence, that's it. The Real Scientists don't have the same agenda that Western Scientists have, they don't hope of becoming famous, or winning a Nobel Peace Prize, or other such nonsense. Their egos are not attached to their work; they do it in a humble way, quietly with no fanfare. What is the main purpose of science? My humble opinion gita 2018 ",

Science and the scientific method is the best way to get the closest to the truth. It won't tell you without a doubt whether this or that is a good/bad/true/false thing. It will bring answers and what you have to do yourself is reflect upon those answers to build your own opinion and decide for yourself if this is good/bad/true/false. I'd also like to add that one (1) research paper is not a proof. You at least need a meta analysis to bring a certain level of proof. Ideally meta analysis compiling other meta analysis would be the best way to go but you can't always find them -especially in areas that are not that well researched. Science can also be biased. It's an institution, a community made out of a majority of upper/middle-class white men that sometimes have trouble considering the sociological implications and causes of a conclusion. Is science perfect? No, but so far it has proven to be the best way to get to the best conclusion. Planes, cars, computers, TVs all those were created with the help of Science. ",

Additionally, I distinguish \u201cscience\u201d from \u201cphilosophy\u201d, since the latter encompasses all potential forms of knowledge including that subset we call scientific knowledge. Thus, scientific knowledge is a part of philosophical knowledge, not the other way around as some people have it. Moreover, the so called \u201cscientific method\u201d is a speculative form of philosophic knowledge and is not scientific knowledge itself. Science is the exercise of the scientific method, not the method itself. ",

The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations.[3] Disciplines which use science, like engineering and medicine, may also be considered to be applied sciences.

So technology came from science [ which is basically concerned with theory] and technology worked, or it was not technology and could be fixed as this computer can be repaired. Science cannot be repaired or fixed, only the theories can be discarded as new ones arise. Science mostly today is an intellectual pursuit and a scientist who is not engaged in the Scientific Method is akin to an academic: theoretical and not of any practical relevance. ",

It is the courage to say \u201cI was wrong\u201d or \u201cthe boss is wrong\u201d. Its opposite is dogmatic literalism: the idea that some text/theory are above reason, and cannot be criticised. We are unfortunately still living an epoch where some domain remains detached from that attitude, like (non confessional) theology, which was born science, though. I like to say that in occident science is born in -500 (Pythagorus) and died in +500 (closure of Plato Academy by Justinian). We are not yet back in science since. In some university, we cannot doubt (Aristotle\u2019s conception of) Matter, if not things like 9/11, or communicate some doubt about the \u201cdanger of drugs\u201d, without taking the risk of losing our job or the whole carier.
