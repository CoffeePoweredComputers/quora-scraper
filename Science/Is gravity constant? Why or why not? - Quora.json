            "answer_text": "First the boring bit, hey I\u2019m a Goddess right , I can be Sheldon Cooper if I like! So Yes gravity is constant. Its in fact calculated as such using whats called the gravitational constant.  Where G means Gravity. Alternatively you can use Newtons formula to calculate the gravity exerted by one body on another. At the moment that the effect of you on the Earth and the Earth on you!  Whatever mass an object is, will denote its total gravitational effect. HOWEVER if you mean does this change due to more mass being added to the earth or any other phenomena? Well yes it does. Very slightly. On a daily basis the moon exerts an influence on the earth and this is so strong that it creates the tides. So the moon is acting as a gravitational force pulling YOU toward the moon. The earth is pulling you toward the Earth. The earth obviously wins. You are closer to the center of mass of the Earth, its bigger and the moon is further way. This is not a negligible difference to the seas since the moon can pull the entire ocean toward it. But it is negliable to you, you are not as large as the ocean PLUS the moon / Tide delay is several hours. It takes time for the moon to pull the tides and by the time they rise the moon has in fact moved on! Gravity decreases according the inverse square rule law too so again its negligible but calculable. Also the earth is in orbit around the sun. Its not a perfect circle this orbit, its elliptical. So when we are closer the SUN does the same as the moon does. But its so far away that this effect is negligible, but its still a phenomena regardless of how slight. The same is true of every other massive body in the solar system acting on the earth. NEXT the earth is indeed getting slightly larger and more massive every year. Debris from space rains on the earth. This includes meteorites and space dust which lands on earth increasing its mass very, very slightly every year. Again its a tiny sum, a few thousand tons. So gravity on earth is 9.807m/s BUT it changes very slightly all day long and all year long. Anyway Don\u2019t lose sleep over it you won\u2019t be getting crushed to a pancake or drifting off into the cosmos any day soon. Instead relax, read my book in fact its free! and Semper In Lucem Solaria: ",

            "answer_text": "No. Gravity is often assumed to be the same everywhere on Earth but varies because the planet is not perfectly spherical or uniformly dense and is weaker at the equator due to centrifugal forces produced by the planet's rotation and at higher altitudes further from Earth's center such as at the summit of Mount Everest. First, there is the variation of gravity with latitude that you alluded to: you weigh about 0.5% more at the poles than on the equator. Second, gravity does indeed change with altitude. The gravitational force above the Earth's surface is proportional to 1/R\u00b2, where R is your distance from the center of the Earth. The radius of the Earth at the equator is 6,378 kilometers, so let's say you were on a mountain at the equator that was 5 kilometers high (around 16,400 feet). You would then be 6,383 kilometers from the Earth's center, and the gravitational force would have decreased by a factor of (6,378 / 6,383) = 0.9984. So the difference is less than 0.2%. Finally, there are very small differences (on the order of 0.01% or less) in gravity due to differences in the local geology. For example, changes in the density of rock underneath you or the presence of mountains nearby can have a slight effect on the gravitational force. ",

            "answer_text": "the force of gravity is not generally constant. It depends on the distance between bodies.We take it to be constant for us because most of our experiments and therefore physics problems happen in a region of space called \u201cearth\u2019s surface\u201d. The width of this region of space compared with the distance from the center of the earth is very small , so we can assume this width to be 0 and say that the distance from the centre is R = about 6000Km for ALL experiments happening at earth\u2019s surface.There are 2 points:There is a taylor expansion being made here, and only 1st or 2nd order terms considered.We care about the centre of the earth because, due to the 1/r^2 dependence of the force, one simple way of calculating it is by considering all mass concentrated at the centre and the rest being empty space.

            "answer_text": " Thanks to the apple that fell in front of Newton and the world got the theory of gravity. Well, it\u2019s the gravity which has kept everything and especially humans grounded without letting themselves fly in cloud nine. If you suppose that gravity is only useful for keeping things grounded on earth, then you are probably wrong. It has helped people from aeons to design drainage systems, lay road networks as well as survey land surfaces. This wasn\u2019t limited here alone, the scientists went one step ahead to construct gravity maps using a combination of ship records, land measurements and remote sensing. However, this was hardly any use to scientists, as they weren\u2019t able to determine the slight changes in the water movement that goes on to cause changes in gravity. The primary cause of gravity on earth is due to the presence of mass inside the earth. Each object has a different mass which leads to a variation of gravity. Thus, the greater the mass of the object, the greater will be its gravity pull. Granite is made up of dense material thus it will tend to exert greater pull over the objects than a material which has lesser dense material. In addition, the earth\u2019s surface has an uneven distribution of landforms and other features which includes deep-sea trenches, mountains and oceans. As each of them has a varying gravity they lead to an uneven gravity field around the earth. Coming to your question, the Earth\u2019s gravity changes every month to the next as the mass of water moving across the earth keeps varying every time. However, this is the very reason which allows one to weigh the different water forms witnessed on earth. Scientists on earth can weigh the rainfall, polar ice caps as well as the ocean. Additionally, gravity differs from place to place. In contrary to what is considered as the gravity is stronger at the equator and lower at the poles, the reality is the opposite. The gravity tends to be greater in the poles because of larger acceleration due to gravity and lower in the equator due to lesser acceleration. Thus, the next time you blame yourself for your weight or feel depressed remember, you are not overweight, just on the wrong place of the Earth! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are asking about whether gravity stays the same as the universe dilates - standard theory says yes because planetary orbits are stable during long term observation periods. But orbital stability depends upon the MG product where M is the central mass - so looms the possibility that either or both could vary - and if they vary such that the MG product remains constant, then gravity could vary as between two masses because the mass factor appears twice F = GM*M/r^2 \u2026\u2026\u2026..(1) To clarify, the orbital parameters v and r would be constant because they are obtained by setting the gravitational force specified by equation (1) equal to the centripetal force M*(v^2/r). (This is approximately true for M>>M* in an approximately circular orbit of radius r). Then MG = (v^2)r. The orbiting mass M* has cancelled - so the orbital velocity v and radius r will be temporally invariant ",

It is such a constant presence in our lives that it\u2019s difficult to image gravity acting any other way. But what if a million years ago gravity were much weaker than it is now? What if gravity were stronger in the Andromeda Galaxy than it is in our own Milky Way? If gravity varied over space and time, how would we know? This is an important question in astronomy, since we assume that gravity is a physical constant, meaning that it has always been the same everywhere throughout the history of the universe. Because of this we can compare observations of different regions of the sky with experiments we do on Earth to understand the cosmos. ",

There is speculation in some physics circles that the \u201cuniversal constants\u201d we observe are not actually constant at all, but actually vary according to other variables.

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy can\u2019t an object on Earth accelerate further than 9.8 m / s^2? \u201c Any Object can be accelerated to more than 9.8 m/s^2. I suspect you totally misunderstood that. What is this 9.8 m/s^2 ? It is the acceleration of a freely falling object towards earth. It accelerates at constant rate i.e. 9.8 m/s^2 (near the surface). But if you want put in more acceleration you can, but all the earth gives is only 9.8. Let\u2019s lookup the equations, Every object pulls every other object by gravitational force in this universe. But the force applied on the other body depends up on masses, distance of both the bodies. Lets deal with equations: F= G Mm/R^2 R= Radius of the Earth (i.e we are calculating the force at distance R from the center of earth, surface) M - Mass of Earth m - Mass of object Let\u2019s look at the acceleration of object from the above equation. a=F/m = GM/R^2 = (6.67408 * (10^(-11)) * mass of Earth) / (radius of Earth^2) = ~9.8m/s^2 So this 9.8 is the acceleration if the body is near the Earth\u2019s surface. If the distance varies, so is this 9.8 value. PS: If you put a ball in space and let it fall towards earth, it won\u2019t have constant acceleration but a constant increase in acceleration. So movement is actually \u201cjerk\u201d. The more it comes near, the more the acceleration will be. While falling, when the ball reaches the surface, it\u2019s acceleration will be 9.8m/s^2 but velocity depends on from where the ball started. ",

That is, mass attracts mass. As matter \u201cpiles up\u201d in concentration, the measured force\u2026 increases in direct relation to the mass (not weight !). Now, to get to a possible (not very probable, but possible) thought. It is possible that dark matter is not matter, but an unknown property of space-time that shows up only at galactic distances (50K light years and up ?). As we know, something is adding to the presently known effect of gravity, over galactic distances. Since we (well\u2026some \u2018we\u2019s\u2019) are loathe to mess with Newton and Einstein\u2026 it is best to call it dark matter; it seems to be undetectable , so far\u2026 Work is being done a new particle detector for CERN that will drastically improve the resolution for detecting particles; that instrumentation may allow CERN to detect something with the properties of dark matter.

The Atlantian crystal was rumoured to have been formed when a zero gravity point touched the Earth but there are no details about the phenomena or what may have caused it, only that it was rare. I did see experiments conducted with the crystal and it had an unusual effect on gravity but no explanation as to the cause or reason. The zero point is the point between two gravitational sources. Eg, the zero point in the gravitational tug of war between the Earth and the Moon is a point on the way to the Moon. The zero point may have been created during the theorizes collision of the Earth and the Moon, or by the Earth with Thera or some other planetary body. It may have been the result of Jupiter's transition. The latest evidence suggests that Jupiter could not possibly have formed in its current location. Somehow it was knocked out of its orbit and passed close to the Sun before settling into its current orbit. According to legend Chronos ate a number of his children but Jupiter escaped. I know science hates it when legend confirms their discoveries but legend and science indicate that there were a number of opportunities for the Earth to be caught in a zero point between the Sun and a gas giant. Unfortunately it's all conjecture and the only evidence that it may have even occurred is one strange crystal and some theories. ",

Therefore as earth formed and as comets hit to become oceans, or any other event which changes the size or density of an object, there will be a mathematicaly modelable outcome. To summarize. All matter has gravity and coalesces in 0g (this was shown on a space shuttle). Earth's mass has changed throughout it's formation, and still is. Therefore Earth's gravity is never perfectly steady.

The Earth has slowly but steadily been increasing in mass due to the asteroids and meteorite falling upon the planet since it first formed. Researchers have figured out that the actual amount of dust falling to the earth is along the lines of 60 tons per day. That means gravity today is a lot greater than it was when the Earth first formed. And the gravity increases every year, ever so slightly. But obviously if measured over a billion years that\u2019s an appreciable increase in gravity. ",

The earth however is not flat and produces a gravity which depends on the mass of the other object and the inverse square of the distance to this object, measured from center to center. ",

This is the acceleration of an object being pulled by the earth, without being affected by air and other effects.(It isn't the maximum acceleration of an object on earth, just the acceleration due to Earth's gravitational pull). It has a (roughly) fixed value, which is determined by the mass of the earth and how far from the earth the object is. ",
