            "answer_text": "This is very simple. Ionic Compounds are the ones which furnish ions in the aqueous solution, and hence helps in the conduction of electricity. COVALENT Compounds are the ones which do not furnish ions in the solution. As such conducion of electricity is very less or negligible. Actually, the water molecules are not able to seperate the elements of the covalent bond by making bond with oxygen and hydrogen due to which the covalent bond within the corresponding molecule remains intact, so that no hydration takes place. On the other hand in Ionic Compounds, the water molecules readily forms bond with the cationic and anionic part of the molecule, which weakens the ionic bond between the corresponding molecule, due to which hydration takes place and the ions are free to move.
