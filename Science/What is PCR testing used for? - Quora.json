            "answer_text": "Diagnostics - does the studied sample (e.g. a piece of meat) contain a specific DNA fragment? e.g. specific of a swan or a dog or maybe even some transgenic soybean flour?Fingerprinting - who of these persons did this hair belong to? Are these two flowers genetically identical?Modification and amplification - let\u2019s add a few nucleotides on one end of this molecule, and a few others on the opposite end or even in the middle of this molecule. Additionally let\u2019s add a radioactive or luminescent moiety to the studied fragment, so that it will be easier to detect it. Let\u2019s increase the quantity of this DNA, so that we may determine its sequence, or use it for cloning (which will allow obtaining even higher quantities of this DNA, e.g. for modification of some cells in a process called transformation or transfection).",

            "answer_text": "PCR is a simple but very useful test procedure that is used in studying molecular biology called the polymerase chain reaction. It is a technique used to amplify and study a particular segment of the DNA of interest in order produce lots of copies\u2026. Typical the PCR tests are used to detect HIV's genetic material, called RNA. Which can be used to screen any donated blood supply and to detect at the very early stages of infections, before antibodies can been be developed. ",
