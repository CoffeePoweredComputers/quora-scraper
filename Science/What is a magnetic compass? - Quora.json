            "answer_text": "What is a magnetic compass? It\u2019s another term for a compass, typically hand held.  The pointer is actually a bar magnet. The south pole is the one with a dot of color, and when the compass is held horizontal to the ground it aligns with Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines which run from pole to pole, and the south pole of the magnet will point towards the north pole of Earth, the same as opposite poles of magnets will attract each other. No matter where you are on Earth, Northern or Southern hemisphere, a compass will point towards Earth\u2019s magnetic north pole. For maritime and airborne navigation, adjustments are made to account for the fact that magnetic north and true north, Earth\u2019s axis, are not the same. The degree of adjustment, called declination, depends on where you are on Earth.  Longitude lines on maps run from rotational pole to pole, so in order to use a compass to accurately arrive at a location from where you are, you add or subtract the degree of declination. If magnetic north is directly between you and true north, no adjustment is needed. If magnetic north lies east of a straight line between you and true north, you adjust your course westward by that number of degrees, and vice versa. If magnetic north and true north were the same, then no adjustments would be needed at all. This may have been true at one point in time, and may be true again, because Earth\u2019s magnetic field is caused by its core\u2019s fluidity, and magnetic north migrates, 10 km per year towards true north.
