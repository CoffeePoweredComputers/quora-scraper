            "answer_text": "Physical laws appear to be the same even at the largest distances in the observable universe when looking at e.g. binary stars or other galaxies. There are plenty of things we can test at that distances, e.g. how these bodies move (they follow the same gravitational laws that we feel on Earth and its surroundings, e.g. the solar system), we can also see their chemical composition through light spectra, which also fits perfectly with current theories of light, and movement (e.g. expansion of the universe). In other words, everything in the observable universe seems to follow the same kind of local physical laws that we experience on Earth. However, we have only explored a tiny part in a tiny period of time, and it is not difficult to conceive (see Pierce, 1982; Wheeler, 1983; Davies, 2008; Smolin, 2013) that physical laws can change over time (rather than across space) e.g. as a function of global variables ruling the entire universe, and so perhaps the constant of gravitation was weaker or stronger in the past, and may change in the future, etc.  This is a question also related to the problem of fine-tuning, and the fact that some variables in the universe seem to have been \u2018fine-tuned\u2019 for the universe (and life) to exist, but this is likely not so (per agreement by scientists, and because the purpose of science is not to presuppose \u2018typicality\u2019, i.e. to presuppose that nothing/everything is a \u2018special case\u2019 that requires a \u2018special explanation\u2019).  The most likely explanation is that these apparently \u2018fine-tuned\u2019 variables are not disconnected from each other and that a large set of different self-consistent values of all those fundamental variables are compatible with the existence of a universe like ours. I am currently performing research in a project of computational cosmology trying to determine at some fundamental level how typical or atypical our universe may be as generated by e.g. a deterministic rule governing the evolution of the universe, so I hope you stay tuned.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure that we do. Albert Einstein stated that the laws of physics are the same everywhere in the universe and for all reference frames. But this assumes three dimensions of space and one of time. Lets consider dimensions to be mathematical properties of the state of a geometrical object. Let\u2019s say that these define the position in space and time of a particle. I can envision a fifth dimension which I would call the probability dimension which asks the question, \u201cOK,the particle exists at a certain place at a certain time, but what is the probability of it being at these coordinates? The probability dimension gives us information as to what probabilities might exist at different points for the other four dimensions ( for this particle). We could also envision a temperature dimension. There may be some law out there that stipulates that the temperature of an object changes with respect to a certain equation depending on the spatial, temporal, and probabilistic coordinates. And if it\u2019s an equation with temperature as a dependent variable (temperature here is a function of space, time, and probability) then it has to be true everywhere in the universe. I\u2019m not sure that the laws of physics will be consistent in systems being invented currently regarding superstring theory, black holes, worm holes, dark energy, and dark matter. But in constructing models of these concepts, physicist then use the same mathematics and physics they have in the past, then they are assuming that all the laws of physics are consistent across some new dimensions we may not have found. If they can get predictability though, out of their theories, then Einstein\u2019s law regarding consistency will hold. But if attempts at verifiability and predictability fail, then consistency fails. So I think the answer to your question is that we do not yet have a reason to think that the laws of physics will be consistent across all dimensions beyond the three of space and the one of time. But I would cross reference my answer with other contributors to Quora. ",
