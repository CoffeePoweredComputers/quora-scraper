            "answer_text": "As a geologist, I\u2019ve been collecting rocks and minerals for more than 50 years. I\u2019ve always been attracted to the infinite variety found in nature around the world. Crystal specimens are natural art. Their beauty can be appreciated in the perfect crystal shapes and beautiful colors. My great uncle, who was also a collector, got me hooked at an early age when we hunted and found crystals in a mine in Utah. Growing up in Colorado, we had great access to mines and tremendous outcrops. We collected crystals or fossils, whatever piqued our interest. I wanted to know more, this passion led to me majoring in geology and I\u2019ve been a professional geologist for over 40 years. On the days my sons had fathers day to read to their classes, I brought in several boxes of rocks telling the class, these are my books. Each rock tells a story and I\u2019d proceed to tell them the story of what each rock told me about how they were formed. The kids loved it. Perhaps I inspired a few to become geologists or at least have an appreciation for the rocks they may see. I still collect and still find enjoyment over finding a unique crystal or fossil. ",
