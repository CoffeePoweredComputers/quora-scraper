            "answer_text": "Newton realised that gravity was responsible for objects falling to the ground and for the orbit of celestial objects. \u2018\u2019 Newton formulated this insight into a mathematical equation, known today as the law of universal gravitation. When combined with knowledge of geometry and Newton\u2019s other equations of motion, we can use it to make predictions about the movement of the planets, or the paths of comets, or how much force is needed to get a rocket to the moon.\u2019\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraph: https://www.science.org.au/curious/space-time/gravity I think global positioning satellites on space provide daily answers for the question. Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are positioned about 12,550 miles above Earth\u2019s surface and therefore are not as close to Earth\u2019s gravitational field. The clocks on these satellites tick faster than the clocks on Earth\u2019s surface so scientists have put a correction into the satellite programs to ensure that the GPS data sent back to Earth\u2019s surface have matching times. Humans still only have a lifespan of 70 \u2013 100 years. Taking a look at our solar system and the planet with the largest gravitational mass, Jupiter, how much longer could we expect to live relative to Earth if we were able to move to there? According to Neil deGrasse Tyson, it would only be a few minutes. I read a nice article on: How Gravity Changes Time: The Effect Known as Gravitational Time Dilation \u2018\u2019 Gravity is not just a force. This effect measures the amount of time that has elapsed between two events by observers at different distances from a gravitational mass. In other words, time runs slower wherever gravity is strongest, and this is because gravity curves space-time.  Did you watch the movie Interstellar and come out wondering how any of it was possible? It is mind-boggling to comprehend that one hour can pass by on one planet while seven years pass by on Earth. The explanation comes down to what scientists call Gravitational Time Dilation. This effect measures the amount of time that has elapsed between two events by observers at different distances from a gravitational mass. In other words, time runs slower wherever gravity is strongest, and this is because gravity curves space-time. Think of it this way \u2014 time follows a simple equation: speed = distance / time Light (in this case, speed) is always constant and travels at a speed of 180,000 miles per second. Imagine two beams of light: one in a weak gravitational field traveling between points a and b, and the other in a strong gravitational field traveling between points c and d.  The path between c and d is longer due to the curving of space and time so it takes longer for light to travel between the two points. This effect has been proven by several experiments and is used to run and maintain something most of us use almost every single day: GPS. Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites are positioned about 12,550 miles above Earth\u2019s surface and therefore are not as close to Earth\u2019s gravitational field. The clocks on these satellites tick faster than the clocks on Earth\u2019s surface so scientists have put a correction into the satellite programs to ensure that the GPS data sent back to Earth\u2019s surface have matching times. Without this correction, GPS satellites would not be the useful tool that we know them to be. \u2018\u2019 Source of the quoted paragraphs: How Gravity Changes Time: The Effect Known as Gravitational Time Dilation ",

About 3/4 of the answers are \u201cbrilliant new theories that are going to overturn physics Real Soon Now\u2122\u201d (i.e. total nonsense). The easiest way to know is to look at your GPS. Does it have your correct location? Then gravity affects time! The GPS satellites are programmed to take relativity into account, and part of that is taking into account the affect of gravity on time. If the programming didn\u2019t match reality, your GPS wouldn\u2019t work. But since your GPS does work, that means the programming does match reality - that is to say, gravity affects time. ",
