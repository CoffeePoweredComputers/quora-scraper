            "answer_text": "When a neutron star is created after a stellar collapse, does it always rotate very rapidly (Pulsar)? Always! When the initial dust and gas cloud collapses to become a star it retains the angular velocity of the initial cloud - only what would be a barely detectable motion in a cloud half a light year across is a definite rotation in a star Our star - our sun - rotates once in about 24 of our days When a star explodes - blows the outer layers into space and has it\u2019s core shrink to a Neutron star that angular momentum is conserved But rather than a radius of about 600,000 km the Neutron star has a radius of about 30 km - 20,000 times smaller So the new Neutron star is spinning a LOT faster - as in several hundred revolutions per second The new Neutron star can transfer some of that angular momentum to the surrounding nebula and slow down a bit! But it will always be spinning very very fast ",

            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t know. Its not clear how we might detect a non rotating neutron star, so there could potentially be a lot of them that we have not detected. However, it is plausible to think of most stellar systems as having some angular momentum, and given the conservation laws applying and angular momentum, and the fact that a lot of the matter in a stellar system gets compressed into a very small core in the genesis of a neutron star, it seems likely that all most all such systems end up rotating very rapidly. I\u2019m not an astronomer, so the above is just based on my knowledge of physics, so take it as you will. ",
