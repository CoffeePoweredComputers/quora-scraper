            "answer_text": "Well skin had nothing to do with the topic so I removed it. Black isn't a colour, it is the absence of colour! You see, our brain translates light to colour. When we see a certain colour, we actually see the light a certain object is reflecting. Main colours are blue, red and green - primary colours in the spectrum, however, it is being argued - the rest are combinations of these.. Here's an example. We see apple as red, but we're not sure whether the apple IS red itself. We know that THE SURFACE reflects light in a way that we see red and absorbs the rest. And when it comes to black then it absorbs all colours - when it's white then it reflects all colours. Black doesn't get darker by anything. The only thing that determines its colour is how much it absorbs. The more a surface absorbs all colours the more 'black' it will be. The darkest I can imagine will be a black hole, since the gravitation is the strongest there.  I hope this answered your question ad gave you more idea about what *colours* are! ",
