            "answer_text": "I graduated CSE in 2012. When I went, the first year of CS classes were pretty terrible. They taught a home-grown conglomeration of C++ macros and templates called Resolve/C++, which was complex, weird, and came with a massive, poorly-written PDF full of free internet clipart. They finally upgraded to Java, so I think it's much better now, but I can't say for sure how much cruft remains. After those first courses, it seems like a pretty normal CS curriculum. Definitely take Crawfis' capstone class if you have the chance. ",
