            "answer_text": "I am an MIT alum from the department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences.  As an undergrad, you are required to take several introductory classes about geology, geophysics, weather, and climate, and math (this is on top of required MIT classes).  You then take classes particular to the topic of planetary science you are interested in (usually more courses on the ones listed above. If you are a graduate student (which I was), then your studies are much more focused on research.  There are technically no required classes, but to take no classes would be foolish because you need to have knowledge of planetary science to pass your general exam usually at the end of your second year.  The general exam consists of presenting two research projects that you have worked on with two different professors, after which they orally quiz you about general knowledge.  Once you have passed this, you then begin working on your PhD thesis, which can take 3-4 years.  At this point you will have to select a faculty member to be your advisor on the project and your research will be very narrowly focused.  There is also the path I took, which was to get my degree in a different program in the department (in my case atmospheric science), but have your research be planetary science.  The requirements for each of the degree programs are different. There is more information here:MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences ",
