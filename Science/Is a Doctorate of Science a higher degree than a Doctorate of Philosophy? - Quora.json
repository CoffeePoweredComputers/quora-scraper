            "answer_text": "In Australia, and in the UK, a DSc is a higher doctorate. A PhD is awarded based on examination of a single thesis, typically [in Australia] about 100,000 words in length. A DSc is awarded on the basis of a collection of published and unpublished works, usually with a unifying theme, representing, in the main, a lifetime of research. I have known a number of people with these higher doctorates, and without exception they have been outstanding research leaders in their field. In the US, the situation is quite different. For example, Buzz Aldrin in 1963 received a DSc from MIT for his thesis on orbital mechanics. In that case, the difference between a PhD and a DSc is moot. ",

            "answer_text": "Doctor of Science (Sc.D) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) - Both degrees are equal. The PhD or The ScD is the highest terminal degree given. There's no difference between the two. Some universities like MIT award both, PhD and ScD degrees while most of the universities in world award PhD as the highest degree. Both degrees have same value. One does the same research in both the degrees. Doctor of Science from The UK and Doctor of Philosophy from The US represents the same dossier. ",
