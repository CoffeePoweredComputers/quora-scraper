            "answer_text": "The atomic volume of transition elements is much lower than those of S and P block elements. This is because of the filling of the (n-1)d orbitals that cause an increase in the nuclear charge and pulls the electrons inward. This results in decrease in atomic volume. With the decrease in the atomic volume, the atomic density of these elements increases. Osmium is having a maximum density. In a given transition series, the density increases in moving across the period and reaches a maximum value at group VIII. The density increases as we move down the group. The atomic sizes of elements of the second and third transition series are nearly same but their atomic weights increase nearly two fold and the densities of elements of third transition series are generally twice of the corresponding second transition series.
