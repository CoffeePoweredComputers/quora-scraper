            "answer_text": "The first time I tried to write a draft of a scientific paper was one of the worst experiences of my life. My professor told me that I finally had enough data, and to go ahead and write up my manuscript! Yay! Yet what was originally a very happy moment for me quickly because a nightmare as I sat there staring at my blank page, with no clue what to put on it. I eventually made an outline that included the major paper sections and started filling it in from the beginning. This painful experience took me about six months, with my professor constantly asking me about my progress (which did not make it less stressful!). I didn\u2019t have one moment in those six months in which I wasn\u2019t thinking about my paper and how badly it was going. I finally put a draft together and finally released it back to my professor for his feedback. And then he promptly rewrote the entire paper. As you can imagine, that was a horrible experience, and I decided then and there that I never wanted to repeat it and never wanted anyone else to repeat. So afterwards, I decided to figure out how a paper really should be written and how to make the process almost formulaic to make it easier for scientists to manage. Welcome to the fruits of this labor. :-) How to write a scientific paper: When beginning our manuscript journey, lets first look at the structure of a typical scientific paper, where we can see the scope of the manuscript at each key part:  As you can see here, the research paper should both start and end with a very broad scope designed to help interest your audience in your research and teach them what they need to know to understand what you did. Unfortunately, many people write as I did - by looking at the structure of a paper and trying to write from the beginning. But as I learned first hand, that can make it very difficult to figure out what to write in each section. Why? Because the hardest parts to write are the parts with the widest scope. And the beginning of a manuscript definitely starts with the widest scope! Instead, I learned that it is always best to write from what you know best. It will help you put pen to paper, and it will help you craft a well-rounded document that includes just the right amount of scope at the beginning and end to first interest a reader and then leave them satisfied with your conclusions. Recommended Manuscript Writing Order: Therefore, I now recommend that scientists write their manuscripts in the following order, which starts from the most familiar parts that are the easiest to write. It then builds on what was already written to make the parts with a wider scope easier to think about and manage. Figures \u2013 Starting the paper with the figures forces an organizational structure and a story. By first assembling data into 4-8 concise figures that follow a logical order, the story and scope of the paper is set.Materials and methods \u2013 With the figures in place, it now becomes simple to write the first section of paper text, which will be the materials and methods required to collect the data that compose the figures. Conveniently, this is also the part of the work that should be the most familiar and therefore easiest to write, as it is the hands-on part of the work that you did and were intimately acquainted with on a daily basis.Results \u2013 Following logically from the materials and methods, the results describe what was seen and discovered when performing the experiments discussed in the materials and methods, and writing this section flows easily from that. I have some tips on writing up your results here: Results need context, too! How to maintain interest in the details.Discussion \u2013 Often drafted simultaneously with the results section, the discussion provides the reader with a sense of what your results mean and how they fit into the context of the field \u2013 widening the scope of the paper back out. For that reason, after a section of the results are written, it is then much easier to ponder these results and draft a brief description of what they tell you and why they are important. You can find very detailed tips on writing the introduction here: Kaycie Butler's answer to What are the simple tips for writing discussion part of the scientific articles? Is it needed to summarize results in the discussion section?Introduction \u2013 After the discussion is written, it becomes obvious what the key points of the research are, what background of the field is required knowledge for the reader to understand the research and place it into context, and what competing or collaborating results in the field have recently shown. This makes writing the introduction AFTER the discussion is already composed a very simple exercise of essentially filling-in-the-blanks, which consists of inserting details about the relevant information required to understand the discussion.Conclusion \u2013 The conclusion is written after the discussion had been laid out, and this section does not summarize the results but tells the reader exactly why this research matters and why it is important to the field. It should take what the information from the discussion and show why those discoveries are important and the impact they have on science\u2026ie., why is it worth publishing and reading this paper? Additionally, the conclusion should flow smoothly from the introduction, showing the reader how the questions about holes in the field that were posed in the introduction were addressed in this paper. I wrote a lot of details about what to think about when writing a conclusion here: Kaycie Butler's answer to How do I write a conclusion for a research paper?Title and Abstract \u2013 These parts are the final touches of the paper \u2013 essentially a cover sheet to the manuscript that is designed to attract attention and interest. The most effective way to write them, therefore, is after the manuscript is finished such that they best reflect the story that is contained in the manuscript and all of the details about the story outline and relevant impact on the field have already been worked out. You can find a detailed formula for how to choose a good title here: Kaycie Butler's answer to How do I create a research title?. You can also find a formula for writing an abstract here: Kaycie Butler's answer to How do I write a research abstract? or go to my website (link in abstract post) to download a very detailed guide to writing an abstract.Feedback - Science doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, and neither does good scientific writing! Never forget to get feedback on your writing early and often. It can help catch mistakes, both major and minor, can point out areas that are confusing or difficult for a reader, and can ultimately greatly improve the quality of work you are putting out in the world.And, there you go! A manuscript draft! May this little guide to drafting a manuscript help you spend much less time than I did on my first manuscript, and may the reviewers be ever in your favor! ",

            "answer_text": "What I usually do are: Zeroth: Read Journal instructions, the scope and the main criteria. First and most important write down in a very concise way the main contributions of my research. By contributions, I mean novel and significant achievements not found in previous articles. If I cannot clearly define my findings, so what do I expect from others, right? Second: I layout the paper. Start by a draft of the paper title, then add headers of sections and bullet points under each header of what I need to discuss, Figures to include, etc. Third: Make a schedule and commit to stick to it (this is particularly important if you are preparing a journal article with no submission deadline; PUT your own deadline). Fourth I prepare my material: Figures, tables, necessary references, etc. Fifth: Start the actual writing under the headers and making sure that I covered all the points highlighted by the bullets. Sixth: After finishing the writings, leave it for a day or two, then back and read it very very very carefully. Make changes (they are always a lot), call this version 2. Seventh: Add conclusion and abstract. Eighth: Leave for a day or two, read carefully and call the modified version version 3. Check for coherence and consistency. Ninth: Change seats and assume you are a referee who wants to reject your masterpiece and looks for inconsistency, weakness, etc. Compare to Journal scope and criteria. Tenth: If possible, give the manuscript to a friend in your field and someone who is remotely in the field (to see the big picture). Eleventh: Read again and make changes. Twelfth: Prepare for submission: Keep files to be submitted in one directory (PDF, ps, tex, bib, cover letter, etc). Submit (a lot to be said here as well). Best of Luck! ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of hints Professors or colleagues can give you.Personally I've found some to be particularly helpful:- Graphs ! Graphs ! Graphs !Do NOT start writing if you don't have your graphs ready. I've made this mistake twice and worked for weeks producing worthless manuscripts. Especially in certain fields, where papers generally do not exceed the 4 pages, changing a curve on a graph may imply that you have to change also your premises and introduction...- Itemize.Take time to sit down with pen and a note book and write down what you need to write down. Example :* Introduction - What I'm talking about ? Why is this important ? Why is my work more important than the other previous ones ? etc etc* Methods - What method did I use ? Samples ?* Results - etc etc etcAnswer all your questions, more will come.- Start ! Or the \"I has a potato\" strategy :)Many people get stuck in front of a blank page. It's normal.Just start writing whatever the hell you have in mind. You will come back later to check and adjust and refine.I call it the two phases strategy. You start by writing \"I has a potato\" and then you work on until you reach a more scientific form like \"Our experimental data indicate the presence of a tuber\"- Create your own double-checking group.Within your office colleagues or friends, be sure to ask some of them to check your manuscript before handling it to the advisors or submitting. Of course be available to check the works of your colleagues as well. Hope this helps :) ",

No. To communicate and disseminate research. off course At last your publication list and citations helps to get a job. What happens if a paper is written badly?Paper is rejected? not exactly. But Somebody who could have been interested Might miss it or Might not understand it. So, you want to write a paper? The Golden rule is \"Think of the Reader\". The silver rule is \"Understand what you want to say\". How to organise your thoughts?. Let's Try writing an editorial summary: Editor\u2019s summaries are 250 characters\u2026 including spaces.Once you have that, broaden it to an abstract of 150 to 200 words. Once you have that, plan the figures, tables, etc. There are different types of Journal you need to look at what does it publish? how much does it publish? There are two types highly selective versus also Large volume. Who reads it? some journals are red by specialist some are multi disciplinary. Following figure illustrates why type of journal you are targeting.These are the elements of the paper. If you look at more closely. In the Introduction topic, key, studies, objectives should be mentioned. In results section you can add evidence. but do not dump data!. guide readers correctly. finally in the discussion part you can put caveats, limitations also future implication that what next can happen. In introduction you need to move your words from general to more specific. Three important factors in Introduction part is Context, focus and findings. In context you can show why you are doing also be specific about what we don't know by previous literature. Second thing in introduction is focusing on key studies and objectives like why should i care?. At last in introduction show your findings as a preview of your methods and results. Let us look Abstract, they are like mini papers. It should only include topic, problem that being addressed, the research and key results. Avoid complex compound nouns. Use the active voice if possible. Try to avoid acronyms. Be very careful with adjectives. Avoid being too assertive, but don\u2019t be vague!At last. Titles are what lure your readers in. Don\u2019t put them off. should contain keywords that makes searchable. avoid complex compounds nouns, acronyms, use active voice.Thank you.  https://www.facebook.com/Nanotechnolo... ",

Once you know the target audience write the background accordingly. What needs more or less explnation depending on audience. Then I would write the results section and methods. These are just a report of how you did it and what you found. Once you have done this you write the discussion in light of the background i.e. what people knew before. As you have researched for the intro you should have a knowledge of the feild. Compare and contrast i.e. differences AND similarities to others work. Then you you provide a conclusion which may be a further hypothesis. Then a 150 to 200 word abstract. ",

As an author you are speaking to the reader. Blend in the work of others before you, that helps to build your case (the objective of your paper). Demonstrate that you are applying prior science to support the advancement of your hypothesis, and provide citations to support your work. Demonstrate (in your words) that you fully understand your topic and conclusions! Never put a link in the body of a scientific treatise; not even an on-line treatise. Links and citations necessary to support your hypothesis are important, but they belong at the end of your paper as numbered references. If you are incapable of explaining how a link supports your hypothesis, the reader is not going accomplish this for you!

Start writing introduction in plain simple language. Try to establish why you are doing it or the need for the paper. Next if you have a experiment site/species/specimen/population make a description/definition of it. Give your rationals here. Then describe methodology of your work. What method, why you chose the specific method and any other details. Next is data (if any) collection/description and result or analysis. After that you can put your conclusions in and provide your limitations and scope for further research. ",
