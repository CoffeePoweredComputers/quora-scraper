            "answer_text": "I will try to anwer in terms of mass, not volume. For starters, for the same volume of air, the mass of helium that occupies that volume is alot less (about 7.3 X). The molar mass of air is about 29 gr/mole, while helium is 4 gr/mole; this creates a bouyant force of 25 gr for every 4 gr of helium used. So if you multiply 1000 lbs by 4/25, you would need 160 lbs of helium. This translates to about 73 kg or roughly 400,000 liters of helium at STP. ",

            "answer_text": "About 500 m^3. I approximated 1000 lbm as 500 kg and I know that net buoyancy comes out very approximately to 1 m^3 displaces 1 kg of mass. It\u2019s a very nice simple rule of thumb near sea level. The 200 feet of altitude is irrelevant in the calculation with this level of approximation. ",
