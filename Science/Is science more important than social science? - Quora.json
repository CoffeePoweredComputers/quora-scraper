            "answer_text": "Is science more important than social science? If done right the social sciences are science and as such are not more or less important than science. Often a distinguished is made between the hard and the soft sciences. That distiguition might make sense if it refers to the accuracy of the measurements. In sciences such as physics measurement is relatively easy and cheap so hard estimates of values can be obtained. In social sciences measurements have much more variability and are much more expensive to get so the values are much softer. Which of course makes the hard sciences much easier and the soft sciences much harder. But both are valuable. ",

            "answer_text": "Important is a very subjective term. Both have their value but science is probably more useful than social science in that it gives more reliable results. The most important thing in the design of experiments is controlling variables. When it comes to social science this becomes nearly impossible due to the number of variables that can affect humans and our societies; many of which are not just outside of our control but may also be too obscure to identify. Such a lick of control means that getting the same repeated result from the same experiment becomes terribly hard and when you have low repeatability you also have low confidence. This doesn't mean that we don't learn important things from social science but it does seem to require more effort for fewer returns. ",
