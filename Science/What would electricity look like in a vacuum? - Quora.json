            "answer_text": "Nothing. Here on Earth, where we have a nice atmosphere, if you have a high enough voltage at a point the electrons will arc to another nearby conductor. When this happens you'll see a bright flash that looks like lightning (since lightning is essentially the same phenomenon, just larger). The reason you get that big flash is because the electrons have ALOT of energy, and as they move through the air they excite the air molecules along the way, meaning they give the molecule some extra energy. Molecules don't like this though, they prefer being at the lowest most stable energy state possible, so they release this extra energy as visible light. In a vacuum there are no air molecules to excite. The electricity can still \u201carc,\u201d meaning the electrons will still jump to another conductor, but there's nothing that'll give off light. ",

You can see electrical effects, like lightning say, when the charges interact with things to give off light. You would not more see electricity in a vacuum than you can see electricity in a wire. ",
