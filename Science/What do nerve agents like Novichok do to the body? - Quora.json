            "answer_text": "Novichok can be ingested through the skin and disrupts the transmission of chemicals through the body's nervous system. One substance, acetylcholine, builds up in the nerves, causing muscles to contract and spasm uncontrollably. Novichok agents, dispersed as an ultra-fine powder rather than vapor, belong to the class of inhibitors called \"organophosphate acetylcholinesterase\". They prevent the normal breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which, when it builds up, causes muscles to contract involuntarily. Because the victim's heart and diaphragm aren't functioning properly, this leads to respiratory and cardiac arrest. Those affected usually die from total heart failure or suffocation as copious fluid secretions fill their lungs. But even if they don't die, the substance can also cause permanent nerve damage, leaving victims permanently disabled, Russian scientists have said. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAs nerve agents, the Novichok agents belong to the class of organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. These chemical compounds inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, preventing the normal breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine concentrations then increase at neuromuscular junctions to cause involuntary contraction of all skeletal muscles (cholinergic crisis). This then leads to respiratory and cardiac arrest (as the victim's heart and diaphragm muscles no longer function normally) and finally death from heart failure or suffocation as copious fluid secretions fill the victim's lungs.\u201d(1) Links:- (1) Novichok agent - Wikipedia ",
