            "answer_text": "The Big Bang is a scientific theory about how the universe started, and then made the starsand galaxies we see today. The universe began as a very hot,small and dense superforce (the mix of the four fundamental forces , with no stars,atoms, form, or structure (called a \"singularity \"). Then about 13.7billion years ago, spaceexpanded very quickly (thus the name \"Big Bang\"). This started the formation of atoms, which eventually led to the formation of stars and galaxies. It was Georges Lema\u00eetre who first noted (in 1927) that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point. The universe is still expanding today, and getting colder as well. As a whole, the universe is growing and the temperature is falling as timepasses. cosmology is the study of how the universe began and its development. Scientists who study cosmology agree that the Big Bang theory matches what they have observed so far. Fred Hoyle called the theory the \"Big Bang\" on his radio show. He did not believe the Big Bang was correct. Scientists who did not agree with him thought the name was funny and decided to use it. Scientists base the Big Bang theory on many different observations. The most important is the redshift of very far away galaxies. Redshift is the Doppler effect occurring in light. When an object moves away from Earth, its color rays look more similar to the color red than they actually are, because the movement stretches the wavelength of light given off by the object. Scientists use the word \"red hot\" to describe this stretched light wave because red is the longest wavelength on the visible spectrum. The more redshift there is, the faster the object is moving away. By measuring the redshift, scientists proved that the universe is expanding, and they can work out how fast the object is moving away from the Earth. With very exact observation and measurements, scientists believe that the universe was a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago. Because most things become colder as they expand, scientists assume that the universe was very small and very hot when it started. Other observations that support the Big Bang theory are the amounts of chemical elements in the universe. Amounts of very light elements, such as hydrogen, helium and lithium seem to agree with the theory of the Big Bang. Scientists also have found \"cosmic microwaves background Radiation\". This radiation is known as radio waves, and they are everywhere in the universe. This radiation is now very weak and cold, but a long time ago it was very strong and very hot. It could be said that time had no meaning before the Big Bang. If the Big Bang was the beginning of time, then there was no universe before the Big Bang, since there could not be any \"before\" if there was no time! Other ideas state that the Big Bang was not the beginning of time 13.8 billion years ago. Instead, some believe that there was a completely different universe before the Big Bang, and it may have been very different from the one we know today.  ",

            "answer_text": "The Big Bang is not a theory. It is just a model to explain the birth of this Universe. It is accepted by most scientists and cosmologists. It is mostly based on two evidences- expanding space and the back ground radiation. It is believed by many that red shift in light coming from the farthest galaxies is mostly due to expanding space. If not, those galaxies cannot fly away at faster than speed of light. Some of the red shift in light is attributed to Doppler\u2019s effect. They think that if galaxies are flying away from each other, then they must have been closure to each other in the beginning. It must have been very hot in the beginning to cause the CMR (cosmic microwave radiation) which we see in the back ground radiation. This is what they say to prove the model of the Big Bang. But there are many questions. The Universe is homogenous and isotropic. There is no evidence that shows space is expanding. All galaxies in the Universe are moving through space. They are not moving as riding on cloud of space and pushed by expanding space. The Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxies are moving towards each other. Galaxies are not embedded in space. Stars in galaxies are moving through space. Gravity is every where in the Universe. If gravity compensate local expansion, then gravity must compensate expansion at 13.8 light years away too. Red shift in light indicates that galaxies are moving away at faster than speed of light. This is not possible. So to accommodate this anomaly, they introduce concept of expansion of space. Gravity over there cannot overcome expanding space. Poor explanation. This does not prove that the Universe is expanding. The Universe is dynamic and all objects in it are in motion, some are moving faster than others. Red shift in light is also not due to Doppler\u2019s effect. In Doppler\u2019s effect, a source emitting light must exists and must physically be moving away from the observer. This is not case with receding galaxies. Light becomes orphan right after being emitted by the source i.e. the sun rays. After emitting these red shifted light, sources must have moved away from the location they emitted those light. What we can learn from this red shifted light is distance and direction of the location where these lights were emitted. This also does not prove that the Universe is really expanding. CMR- the back ground radiation. NASA has taken an image of this radiation. It has been proved by scientists that this is sure sign of the Big Bang. It was taken just recently. If we look at it, we hardly find any variation in temperature. It is almost very smoothed. How can it be even after 13.8 billion years after the event and passing through all galaxies, voids since then? According to this image, the Universe should be full of uniformly distributed particles only. Instead, we see fully formed planets, stars, galaxies, cluster of galaxies and super voids. CMR is not the evidence of the Big Bang. All galaxies are surrounded by hallow and intergalactic space of particles which are heated by radiation from stars in the galaxies. CMR is due to this. Hubble telescope has taken a deep field image of galaxies at 13.2 billion light years away. The oldest galaxy in that field is 13.2 billion years old. Our home galaxy is 13.2 to 14 billion years old. It is found that the oldest star in our home galaxy is 14 bullion years old. It is believed that the Milky Way galaxy is the oldest in the Universe. There is a super massive black hole at its center. How can this black hole can exists at the moment of the Big Bang? It is impossible. We do not see any evidence of the Big Bang in local Universe. Energy cannot be created or destroyed. This is what we see in the Universe. This must be true at any event in this Universe without any condition. Energy can keep on changing from one form into the other. There is no proof of infinite density, pressure, temperature in the beginning of the Universe. The model of the Big Bang breaks down as they go closure to the point of creation. This means it is not correct. It does not have any solution of it. It only indicates our in ability to understand this Universe. The Big Bang is a theory to explain how the Universe began. It has many holes for which we have no answers. No one has seen the edges or boundary of the Universe. We do not know size of this Universe. How can we say it is expanding? Expanding into what? Expanding from where? This model has many problems-magnetic mono problem, flatness problem, horizon problem, inflation problem, thermodynamics problems, etc. It is not a theory at all. We have to search for better explanation to understand our Universe. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u2018Big Bang\u2019 is really a misnomer, it would better be described as an \u2018Expansion Event\u2019 (EE). There are some very difficult components to understand here, firstly, the EE did not happen in space because space as we know it, would not have allowed the singularity to expand; space is not empty. The EE must have occurred within (even that word is inaccurate) a state where there was neither space nor time. Question 1. Where did the singularity come from? There are no viable explanations for this other that a) flights of science fiction, and b) God (which so far is the most reasonable explanation. Question 2. How was the singularity moved from \u2018x\u2019 into the state of no time or space? Again there are no answers to this other than those answers given to question 1, above. However theoretically speaking if we managed to place a Super-dense Particle of matter into a condition of no time or space, it is likely that it would expand at incredible speeds, far in excess of the speed of light buy many thousands of factors. I believe the closest analogy we have in this material universe is injecting a gas into a vessel containing a vacuum, the gas will expand to fill every available volume. As the available volume is infinite, the universe will expand infinitely, until it runs out of energy. The creation of matter in the void is key to instantly creating both space and time, in this sense, when we say space, we mean dimension, rather that outer-space. Matter cannot exist without both time and dimension.. If we move we travel in both time and dimension, i.e. meters (dimension/space) per minute (time), matter also can only exist in dimension and time because time and dimension are relative and interdependent. So there was no \u2018Bang\u2019 just a very fast expansion, the balloon analogy is one that tends to be misleading, the balloon did not burst, we are living in it, it is called the universe. A better analogy, and one I used to use when lecturing was that of a huge chocolate muffin. We put all our ingredients into the mix to make the muffin, just as was in the singularity, then we pop it into the oven, our void. What happens then is the ingredients start to expand and we need to imagine that the chips are the solid matter that formed into galaxies. As our muffin expands the chips move further apart, the chips close to the centre of the muffin move apart, but much more slowly than those chips further out toward the edge. Assuming we are close to the centre of the universe, the galaxies near the Milky Way will move but slowly, those out near the boundary of the universe will move apart at incredible speeds. Recently we have observed something called Ram Stripping in something like eleven thousand galaxies, where new stars are no longer being created, and brown-dust is starting to be a feature. I believe that this Ram Stripping is the first sign that our universe is starting to run out of energy. What will happen as the universe runs down is anyone\u2019s guess, maybe that expansion will stop and the universe will start to shrink, or collapse, heading for the \u2018Big Implosion\u2019. There are also indications that this is happening. William G. Tifft of the University of Arizona had been looking at lists of red shifts (rates of expansion or how fast galaxies are moving apart) from distant galaxies. On a graph, he plotted the red shifts, which he corrected for the effects of the Earth's motion. If the red shifts from these objects are the result of their speeding away from Earth, their red shifts should be evenly spread over the known range of shifts. Tifft found that they're not even at all. The red shifts are clumped into patterns. The intervals are about 72 kilometers per second, with some half that value and some one-third of that value. Astronomers from the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh verified his results.  A second study by Tifft has shown that galaxy red shifts measured from Earth have changed in just a few years! This change is completely unexpected by proponents of the big bang theory. The change is large enough that Tifft expects to be able to test the rate at which these changes take place within only a few years! One suggestion is that red shifts may be some sort of decay phenomenon rather than expansion of the universe. The end is near? Maybe! Sorry for the longish answer but it is complicated. ",

            "answer_text": "  What is the Big Bang Theory (in simple terms)? The Big Bang theory states that the universe was extremely hot and dense, and then space itself expanded very quickly to add space between things, and this caused the universe to cool enough for atoms to form. The beginning of the expansion took place about 13.8 billion years ago, and space everywhere is still expanding. The Big Bang theory is not a theory about the universe beginning to exist, and begins with space-time, matter, and energy already in existence. It is also not a theory about a universe coming from nothing. That is a common misconception that the media, and even some scientists, have. There was no explosion, and there was no point of origin, nor was there a center to the expansion. Picture a space that is chock full of matter, and then imagine the space itself begins to expand so that space begins to grow between the particles of matter, so that the solid block now looks like it is full of smoke, and then imagine gravity causing the smoke to collect into thin tendrils, a sort of three-dimensional web that is made of galaxies. That is one way to picture the Big Bang. \u201cDid the Universe expand from a point? If so, doesn't the universe have to have an edge?No. The Big Bang was not an explosion IN space. It was a process that involved ALL of space. This misconception causes more confusion than any other in cosmology. Unfortunately, many students, teachers, and scientists(!) mistakenly picture the \"Big Bang\" as an explosion that took place at some location in space, hurtling matter outward. In reality, ALL of space was filled with energy right from the beginning. There was no center to the expansion, and no magical point from which matter hurtled outward. The confusion arises in part because of the amazing conclusion that the OBSERVABLE portion of the universe was once packed into an incredibly tiny volume. But that primordial pellet of matter and energy was NOT surrounded by empty space... it was surrounded by more matter and energy (which today is beyond the region we can observe.) In fact, if the whole universe is infinitely large now, then it was always infinite, including during the Big Bang as well. To put it another way, the current evidence indicates only that the early universe - the WHOLE universe - was extremely DENSE - but not necessarily extremely small. Thus the Big Bang took place everywhere in space, not at a particular point in space\u201d Brief Answers to Cosmic Questions ",

            "answer_text": "By definition a space-time is a smooth 4D manifold X admitting a Lorentzian metric g whose curvature tensors satisfy the Mileva Marity-Einstein field equations for some \u201creasonable\u201d distribution of matter and energy. On the other hand, the singularity theorems of Penrose and Hawking assert that any such space-time must contain singular points. In other words, it can\u2019t be a smooth manifold with metric g defined at every point. The logical conclusion is that the universe cannot exist (a valid point as per Wheeler\u2019s Participatory Universe and Langan\u2019s CTMU Self-determinatory Universe the universe is as mental as it is physical). Yet somehow God was able to overcome this difficulty, or at least we think so. The only other publicized attempt is due to Hawking and Hartle. The Hawking-Hartle \u201cno boundary\u201d theory has been popularized as a theory of \u201cimaginary time.\u201d A better description of the geometry of the model is given by saying that in a small neighborhood of the \u201cbig bang\u201d the metric changes signature, becoming positive definite locally. The physical interpretation is that at the moment of creation none of the four directions in space-time had yet been distinguished as \u201ctime.\u201d One possible explanation is that close to the topological singularity spatial and time dimensions were interchanged: time was more \u201cspatial\u201d while spatial dimensions were more like \u201ctime\u201d we experience at present time. Gradually, these dimensions took the shape we intuitively understand today. The other explanation is that \u201ctime\u201d simply do not exist as according to Tesla time is just a notion for the flow of entropy, which only has a true physical meaning. All physics equations can be re-written with time removed and replaced with the entropy flow. Entropy flow is two-headed, the two prongs stemming from the topological singularity manifold. The universe is eternal as existence precedes ontology (philosophy of existence). Time does not exist. Imagine the \u201cAxis of Existence\u201d and somewhere on it a \u201cpoint\u201d of topological singularity and of minimal entropy from which entropy flows in two directions. Thus our universe is a perfect topological space in every point of its eternal existence. ",

            "answer_text": " The Big Bang Theory is a cosmological model that explains the large-time scale evolution of the observable universe. The model explains how Universe evolved and expanded from an initial point with extremely high temperature and density to how we observe it today. The Universe expanded from this point of singularity where known laws of space and time break down and quantum interactions hold. This model is the most widely accepted as the model explaining the evolution of the Universe among Astrophysicists, Astronomers, and Mathematicians. Big Bang Model offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed criteria in the Universe, like Cosmic Background Radiation, large-scale structure of the observable Universe, expansion of the Universe, and abundance of light elements i.e. Hydrogen and Helium. This theory is compatible with the Hubble\u2019s Law- the phenomena that farther the galaxies- the faster they will be moving away from each other.  Space and Time were born at the time of big bang and therefore, known laws of physics came into existence at the time of Big Bang. Therefore, any event which may have occurred before the Big Bang would not affect any event of the modern Universe as time itself came after the Big Bang. Careful analysis of the expansion rate of the Universe and detailed measurements spot the Big Bang to have occurred at 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus accepted as the age of the Universe. Features of the Model The model depends on 2 major assumptions- The universality of physical laws = This assumption states that all parts of the Universe are subjected to the same laws of nature that we find here on Earth. This was the underlying assumption of General relativity.Cosmological Principle = This principle suggests that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic.These assumptions have been tested separately and results gathered from experiments have agreed with the theoretical results. The first assumption was tested by calculating and analyzing observations of the Universe showing the largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant over the age of the Universe to be of the order of. Also, the large-scale structure of the Universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth. If it is isotropic, then one can derive the cosmological principle from the simple Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred observer or vantage point. The cosmological principle has therefore been calculated to an order of via observations of the temperature of the CMB. The Universe at the has been measured to be homogenous with an upper bound of the order of 10% inhomogeneity. ",

            "answer_text": "The Big Bang theory is a cosmological model of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of extremely high density and high temperature, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure. Crucially, the theory is compatible with Hubble's law \u2013 the observation that the farther away galaxies are, the faster they are moving away from Earth. Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the theory describes a high density state preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning. There is no evidence of any phenomena prior to the singularity. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After its initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements \u2013 mostly hydrogen, with some helium and lithium \u2013 later coalesced through gravity, forming early stars and galaxies, the descendants of which are visible today. Besides these primordial building materials, astronomers observe the gravitational effects of an unknown dark matter surrounding galaxies. Most of the gravitational potential in the universe seems to be in this form, and the Big Bang theory and various observations indicate that it is not conventional baryonic matter that forms atoms. Measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, an observation attributed to dark energy's existence. Source: Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "The Big Bang theory is the phenomenon which gave birth to the Universe that we know today. It took place from a small singularity which was very densely populated with the matter. The Expansion took place in a very shot fraction of a time. Matter and Anti-Matter were the first to come into existence and later on the atoms combined to form molecules and gases. The expansion of the Universe occurred at a very high rate of Speed. Which was referred as a huge explosion.  As the time passed matter evolved and cooled down to form the Space bodies. It took Billions and Millions of years to form a rocky planets and other space bodies.  The Expansion is still taking place at an increasing n rate of speed as compared to that of the time of Big Bang. The Scientist have stated with the help of the Quantum technologies that at some point this expansion will come to halt and it will reverse the conditions. i,e. the Universe will start contracting in the opposite direction. The Scientists have stated that our Universe goes through a Cyclic - Expansion state which is called as the Cosmic Cyclic Universe theory. The Theory of Multi Universe was also explained by these Scientists. As they said, it is possible that the Multiple Universe Exist as the Universe goes through four different state of Expansion.  As the Universe we know today is Expanding at a very very high rate of Speed. Similarly, the events occurring in this Universe could be completely different as those are taking place in Other four.  Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The BBT describes a hypothetical expansion of the universe which repeatedly violates every Law of Physics known to mankind, after some other unexplainable event which also violates every known Law of Physics, creates the universe. The Big Bang leaves behind a universe made of 96% undetectable \u201cFlat Earth\u201d which had been moved apart faster than the speed of light by the \u201cTooth Fairy\u201d. The BBT creates two types of \u201cFlat Earth\u201d. \u201cDark Matter Flat Earth\u201d which pulls the universe together. \u201cDark Energy Flat Earth\u201d which pushes the universe apart. These two contradictory things then must be balanced in such a finely tuned manner that a single change to the \u201cDark Energy\u201d - of one part in a Trillion, Trillion, Trillion, Trillion, Trillion, Trillion, Trillion, Trillion, Trillion, Trillion would lead to nothing recognizable in the universe at all. Of course, this doesn\u2019t bother anybody, nor does the fact that we can\u2019t find any \u201cFlat Earth Matter or Energy\u201d no matter how much time or money we spend. However, since the BBT is wrong unless the Flat Earth exists, this proves the Flat Earth exists and you are a crackpot if you don\u2019t agree. Which brings us to the Tooth Fairy\u2019s contribution. When we noticed that every single part of our universe is exactly the same, and that this observation violates the entire premise of evolution, which mathematically stated is TIME = CHANGE. We need a fix. So we teach that when the universe is very young, and very close together, everything in the universe \u201ccommunicates\u201d with each other and become exactly the same. The Tooth Fairy then eats these undetectable, un-provable things called \u201cInflatons\u201d which apparently grow on the Flat Earth, cause we can\u2019t find any of this stuff, anywhere. But should we have to??? I once heard it said that extraordinary claims required extraordinary something or other\u2026but that only applies to people who don\u2019t agree with what I say. Intellectuals don\u2019t need facts to be right. Anyway, the Tooth Fairy then grows strong enough to move every part of the universe apart faster than the speed of light, forget Einstein. If we just call things that WE CAN OBSERVE, CAN MEASURE AND CAN MAKE PREDICTIONS BASED UPON - \u201cNothing\u201d. Then, when we have said that \u201cNothing\u201d moved faster than the speed of light, and we haven\u2019t violated Einstein. Isn\u2019t it great to just make stuff up and call it science? Here Alan Guth, the Inventor of the Tooth Fairy/Inflation theory explains how Al Gore is President and Elvis is still alive.  Anyway, when the Tooth Fairy and the Flat Earth are finally finished putting the stuff in the universe where it is\u2026we notice a few things are missing. I\u2019m not saying the Tooth Fairy is a thief, but there are a lot of teeth missing in the houses she breaks into.\u2026just sayin, maybe that\u2019s who stole all the anti-matter. If the universe magically created itself out of nothing then it should have created just as much anti-matter as matter. Which would instantly destroy the universe. Problem? Not if you don\u2019t teach anyone about it. And where are the monopoles?!?! Who took the monopoles? Unsolved problems in the Big Bang model - Physics and Universe Darn it! If the Big Bang happened there would be hard evidence left behind, so what if it doesn\u2019t exist. We can ignore the evidence because the BBT made TWO CORRECT PREDICTIONS! 1. The BBT correctly predicts the abundance of light elements is the universe. As proven by this article - Fusion experiments show that the Big Bang can't account for lithium. Replication of Big Bang reveals flaws in theory of atom formation Darn it! O.K. scratch that - The BBT made ONE CORRECT PREDICTION! 2. The BBT predicts a Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. Just one small problem with the CMB though\u2026. In 2004, NASA discovered that the CMB says the EARTH is the CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. Lawrence Krauss, PhD is a Professor of Theoretical Physics at Arizona State and arguably the loudest spokesperson for Atheism on the planet. He states - That's crazy. We're looking out at the whole universe. There's no way there should be a correlation of structure with our motion of the earth around the sun \"the plane of the earth around the sun\" the ecliptic. That would say we are truly the center of the universe. THE ENERGY OF EMPTY SPACE THAT ISN'T ZERO So far the results have been confirmed by THREE DIFFERENT SATELLITES, COBE, WMAP and PLANCK. George Efstathiou, Ph.D. is a Professor of Astrophysics at the University of Cambridge and director of the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, here is what he said at the press conference annoucing the PLANCK SATELLITE results - \"Why characteristics of the CMB should relate to our solar system is not understood. ... I was explicitly told not to say anything about God in this talk\u201d Planck probe's cosmic 'baby picture' revises universe's vital statistics Darn it! O.K. scratch that - The BBT has made NO CORRECT PREDICTIONS! Well, unless you want to admit the Earth is the Center of the Universe. Bottom line - Intellectuals don\u2019t need facts to be right. ",

            "answer_text": "The Big Bang theory is that the universe started - about 13 billion years ago - as something very small and expanded to what it is today. That is easy enough to understand, but the obvious questions are: What was \u201cbefore\u201d the Big Bang?Where does the universe end? ie does it have an edge or does it go on forever?How come can it have expanded so much - ie faster than the speed of light?To answer these questions, you need to get your head around Einstein\u2019s theories of relativity. This is not as difficult as you might think. Einstein\u2019s theories provide some very counter-intuitive information, but once you get them, things seem more logical. Relativity says that \u201ctime\u201d is all relative and it is affected by gravity. Also it says the feeling you get from gravity is the same as you get from acceleration. You could not tell the difference between being in a lift that is going down or in a box on the moon - where the gravity is less. When you get a lot of gravity, time slows down. This can be proved and it actually happens in satellites and has to be corrected for. When you get a massive amount of gravity, time slows down to the point where it stops. So at the Big Bang when the whole of the universe was but a dot (technically called a singularity), time stopped. It therefore doesn\u2019t make sense to talk about \u201cbefore\u201d the Big Bang. It was when time began. Relativity also says that space is \u201ccurved\u201d, so just like the surface of the Earth is curved, so too is space. This is more difficult to get your head around. If the Earth was as large as the universe, you would get the impression it was completely flat - because it would curve so little, you would not be able to perceive it. You might think that because it was flat, it went on forever - ie to infinity and beyond - but actually if you walked for long enough, you would come back to where you started. So too with space. Ignoring the fact that the universe is expanding, if you sent off a rocket in any direction you like, it would eventually arrive back where it started. Because the universe itself is expanding, we are moving away from distant obects (eg galaxies) faster than the speed of light (which Einstein said was impossible). This sounds implausible, but the objects aren\u2019t moving, it is space that is expanding. Its like drawing two crosses on a balloon, then blowing up the balloon. The crosses stay where they are, but get further and further apart. So there you have it. Once you can accept the predictions of Einstein\u2019s theories of relativity, you see things differently. Fortunately, this does not mean you have to be able to solve his field equations though! ",

The summarised points of this theory are as follows- 1. The tiny particles grouped together. They formed atoms. Then those atoms grouped together. These atoms came together to form stars and galaxies. 2. The first stars created bigger atoms and groups of atoms called molecules. That led to more stars being born. 3. At the same time, galaxies were crashing and grouping together. As new stars were being born and dying, then things like asteroids, comets, planets, and black holes formed. ",

            "answer_text": "The big bang is how astronomers explain the way the universe began. It is the idea that the universe began as just a single point, then expanded and stretched to grow as large as it is right now (and it could still be stretching). What's This Big Bang All About? In 1927, an astronomer named Georges Lema\u00eetre had a big idea. He said that a very long time ago, the universe started as just a single point. He said the universe stretched and expanded to get as big as it is now, and that it could keep on stretching. What an Idea! The universe is a very big place, and it\u2019s been around for a very long time. Thinking about how it all started is hard to imagine. Some More Information Just two years later, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble noticed that other galaxies were moving away from us. And that\u2019s not all. The farthest galaxies were moving faster than the ones close to us. This meant that the universe was still expanding, just like Lema\u00eetrethought. If things were moving apart, it meant that long ago, everything had been close together. Everything we can see in our universe today\u2014stars, planets, comets, asteroids\u2014they weren't there at the beginning. Where did they come from? A Tiny, Hot Beginning When the universe began, it was just hot, tiny particles mixed with light and energy. It was nothing like what we see now. As everything expanded and took up more space, it cooled down. The tiny particles grouped together. They formed atoms. Then those atoms grouped together. Over lots of time, atoms came together to form stars and galaxies. The first stars created bigger atoms and groups of atoms called molecules. That led to more stars being born. At the same time, galaxies were crashing and grouping together. As new stars were being born and dying, then things like asteroids, comets, planets, and black holes formed! A Super Long Time How long did all of this take? Well, we now know that the universe is 13,800,000,000 years old\u2014that\u2019s 13.8 billion. That is a very long time. What's in a Name? That\u2019s pretty much how the universe began. Because it got so big and led to such great things, some people call it the \"Big Bang.\" But maybe a better name would be the \"Everywhere Stretch.\" What do you think? ",

            "answer_text": "The BBT is a theory based on observed and/or speculated about phenomenon such as Dark Energy/Dark Matter which makes up reportedly 96% of the total energy of the universe which scientists have no idea what it is or how and why it functions and that\u2019s why its called \u201cDark.\u201d Yet they claim that all this unknown energy and all the unknown vastness of the universe (which could be infinite or nearly so) containing untold trillions of galaxies somehow exploded/inflated/popped/expanded into existence 13.8 billion years ago from a infinitesimally small and infinitely dense point which they call a \u201csingularity\u201d that is physically indescribable, mathematically unverified, and beyond the conceptions of space and time . And I submit this claim is not only presumptuous but preposterous on its face. The philosophy of the universe cannot be predicated on the observations of so-called science. If such a metamorphosis could not be seen, a scientist would be inclined to deny the possibility of developing a butterfly out of a caterpillar. Likewise without knowing/understanding the function of \"Dark Energy\" which comprises 71% of total universe energy one can only speculate as to the cause of space expansion and one cannot rightly rule out that space itself does not periodically expand and contract. To conclude: The BBT claiming the universe was born into existence from a supposed initial infinitely dense and infinitesimally small \"singularity\" 13.8 billion years ago is just what it is. Its a theory. NOT a fact. And the scientific community is doing a great disservice to the general public by presenting said theory as pretty much scientific fact/truth. To me it is utter foolishness to assert you know the age of the universe and how it came to be when you do not understand 96% of the energy of the universe and you do not even know its vastness. ",

However, the creator of the universes refers to it in His verbatim book as ONE ENTITY when the creator caused this one entity to split into seven universes. Our universe with its vastness is so tiny by comparison with the other six universes but scientists still can\u2019t decipher our tiny universe let alone the other six. Although I have answered a similar question to this many times before, I\u2019ll repeat it here for your sake. The universe we know so far is only the first tiny universe and the distance from the first universe to the second is 500 years and 500 years between each of the rest of the universes up to the seventh universe. Universe one compared to the second universe is like a ring in a desert. Universes 1+2 compared to the 3rd. are like a ring in a desert. Universes 1, 2, and 3 compared to the 4th. are like a ring in a desert. Universes 1, 2, 3 and 4 compared to the 5th. are like a ring in a desert.

All the seven universes compared to the chair where God puts His foot are like a ring in a desert. The seven universes and the chair compared to the throne of God are like a ring in a desert. The seven universes, the chair and God\u2019s throne compared to God\u2019s knowledge are like a ring in a desert. Now imagine how small our known universe is in comparison to the rest. Scientists will continue to discover more and more with time but the verbatim book of the creator, the Holy Qur\u2019an, has already given us the answers but scientists think that they know better than the ONE who created them instead of believing in what God has revealed to us in His verbatim book.

The cosmos contained a vast array of fundamental particles such as neutrons, electrons and protons. These decayed or combined as the universe got cooler. This early soup would have been impossible to look at, because light could not carry inside of it. \"The free electrons would have caused light (photons) to scatter the way sunlight scatters from the water droplets in clouds,\" NASA stated. Over time, however, the free electrons met up with nuclei and created neutral atoms. This allowed light to shine through about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. This early light \u2014 sometimes called the \"afterglow\" of the Big Bang \u2014 is more properly known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB). It was first predicted by Ralph Alpher and other scientists in 1948, but was found only by accident almost 20 years later. [Images: Peering Back to the Big Bang & Early Universe] Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, both of Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, were building a radio receiver in 1965 and picking up higher-than-expected temperatures, according to NASA. At first, they thought the anomaly was due to pigeons and their dung, but even after cleaning up the mess and killing pigeons that tried to roost inside the antenna, the anomaly persisted. Simultaneously, a Princeton University team (led by Robert Dicke) was trying to find evidence of the CMB, and realized that Penzias and Wilson had stumbled upon it. The teams each published papers in the Astrophysical Journal in 1965.\u201d ",

My opinion: [1] If not for the possibility of quantum probabilistic physics creating several multiverses, and among them, by probability, there will be at least one, ours. FAQ # 1 = Could a black hole and a white hole (Einstein-Rosen bridges) have triggered the bing bang? My opinion: [1] I mean the black hole as responsible for keeping the seeds (matter) between the connected multiverses and the white hole for spreading the seeds, through the big bang. [1] An exit to the origin of this universe would be that this universe is connected to a larger, closed, cyclical universe (different from Penrose), older and spatially infinite. [1] And when the first of a series of other multiverses comes to an end what happens is what we see in the Hubble parameter: a difference in the rate of expansion, an increase, due to the energy generated by the end of a multiverse.

ORCID orcid.orgCleiton Da Costa Cleiton Da Costa (0000-0003-4848-2478). E-mail: yamabushicleiton@gmail.com Dedicated to the memory of Fred Hoyle This article presents a scenario configured for what would have triggered the big bang. The inspiration came from renowned British astronomer Fred Hoyle. Until his death, he never accepted the idea of the big bang, even with the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation (Penzias & Wilson 1965), the oldest in the universe, present throughout the cosmos and practically the same in any direction, suggesting that at some point that distance had been much closer, in a hot and dense point until it suffered cosmic inflation. But his conviction that the universe has always existed, will exist and will continue to exist, an eternal universe, served as an expiration for this research, with the configuration of a scenario it was possible to put its persistence in a logical and linear model. RESUME In this article I will give an outlet to one of the greatest mysteries of astrophysics: what was there before the big bang? (Penrose et al. 2018) Apparent evidence for Hawking points in the CMB Sky, reported remnants of a universe prior to ours, were identified in cosmic microwave background radiation, through certain patterns that seem swirling, called Hawking. The Stationary state, (Hoyle et al. 1948) x inflationary state, Georges Lama\u00eetre (1927 and 1931), this defended an expanding universe, that a stationary, homogeneous, isotropic and spatially infinite universe. Alan Guth (1981) cosmic inflation, hyperinflation greater than the speed of light. Albert Einstein (1917), proposed his model of universe, based on his theory of general relativity, being homogeneous, isotropic and static. Stephen Hawking, BBC Brasil report (2015) \u201cIf you fall into a black hole, don't surrender\u201d, at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden; \"There is a way out\". Multiverse, Erwin Shor\u00f6dinger (1952), in a lecture in Dublin, the first known reference to the multiverse. One of Karl Schwarzschild's solutions, White holes, also foreseen in the theory of relativity. The big crunch, one of the theories for the end of the universe. If there was a way to combine all this knowledge, among others possible, in a single model of pre big bang, evolution of a universe previous to ours, where they all fit together to explain what was there before the big bang, however, not individually, in order to configure a scenario in which it may be possible to explain this questioning. I explore the possibility that all of these studies can complement each other to form a timeline. Research and observations over the next decades, for a more complete model, through technological advances for the collection of more data is necessary, as well as the use of synthetic scientific computer simulation methods, with algorithms and techniques, to measure, refine , define and reproduce this scenario.

            "answer_text": "As far as I know, the complete story of the Big Bang came into being, and also operates is actually a little more on the humongous side than you have probably heard, and by the way, you do understand where this so called Big Bang theory originated from I dare to take it - if you had stated Hawking you would have been correct. Hawking said that the whole shebang, every thing out there, that is in the sky, the star, the planets, comets, you name it, originally was not there, they all, he said, are the product of the Big Bang. He further said, nothing was here, and in strange way, space itself was not here too. Now who is going to prove that wrong, since you cannot recreate that. He said that the universe, and that means everything, started with the Big Bang, this itsey bitsy nugget of matter if you even wish to call it that, although technically that is probably a valid term, just kind of appeared, then the \u201cbang\u201d part. OK, so is that possible, yes that is possible, well at least we thing so, because we actually have come to believe that there are Black Holes all over the place, and the Big Bang nugget of matter of which I speak was in fact a Black Hole; that is correct the Big Bang was begun by a Black Hole. Now the strange part that a whole lot of people don\u2019t include when they tell this story, is that that black hole, the one that initiated the Big Bang, was actually the collapse from the previous universe that existed, but had, for a variety of reasons, came squashing down to eventually form that Black Hole. So it is reasonably safe to say, that the Big Bank phenomenon was a continually occurring thing - Big Bang, then Universe, then Universe Callapse to Black Hole, then Big Bang, over and over again, and this means then that the universe is like the beat of a heart somewhat, expanding, then collapsing, but each time, loosing some of its mass, loosing some of it\u2019s energy, which means, that each time a new universe is formed it is a little different, because simply, it contains less energy, so in a nutshell, is less cooler, well it is less cooler on the of course, but I mean less swankies I suppose is a good way to put it. How many times has this happened, I don\u2019t know, I doubt anyone truly does; but one thing we do know, is that there was a first time, which the black hole that started it was most likely unstable, as I tend to think there are several variety of Black HOles, but that may be just a guess.

Some idiot decided to pop it with a sharp in and that caused a lot of trouble. All this hot gas made up of quarks and gluons rushed out into the cold andbecame 98% hydrogen and helium, plus a small amount of other stuff like oxygen, nirogen carbon magnesium etc. The cooling caused the stuff to cool trapping the poor old quarks inside forever, floating in space. The hydrogen and helium formed the stars which are still giving light and heat, and the other stuff formed planets and the crazy thing called life \u201coccurred\u201d. God knows how! And the extreme form of life became human kind which is a sort of noxious fungus which fortunately is destroying itself. ",

            "answer_text": "In 1922, Russian cosmologist & mathematician Alexander Friedman found that solutions to Einstein's general relativty field equations resulted in an expanding universe.  Big bang proponents suggest that some 10 billion to 20 billion years ago, a massive blast allowed all the universe's known matter and energy\u2014even space and time themselves\u2014to spring from some ancient and unknown type of energy.  The big bang is an attempt to explain how the universe developed from a very tiny, dense state into what it is today. It doesn't attempt to explain what initiated the creation of the universe, or what came before the big bang or even what lies outside the universe.  Another misconception is that the big bang was a kind of explosion. That's not accurate either. The big bang describes the expansion of the universe. While some versions of the theory refer to an incredibly rapid expansion.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are lots of answers (and books ) which explain the Big Bang. The concept that OUR universe began from small beginnings and has grown ever since is well documented. Various problems (like the horizon problem) have been explained through various evolutionary stages (like Inflation). For me, the main achievement of the Big Bang Theory is that it explains why OUR universe is not static. This used to be the status quo for physics 100 years ago but it is hard to comprehend how OUR universe could remain unchanging forever. The Big Bang Theory has given us a way to understand the beginning of OUR universe and an evolutionary process and this is currently mainstream science. The problem with the Big Bang it that it does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the end of OUR universe. Some scientists have postulated that OUR universe could end in a 'wimper' of photons. This is an interesting idea because this is very similar to the environment that was expected at the Big Bang. These scientists suggest that the beginning was really a Big Bounce and that we live within a universe (OUR universe) which is one of a series of universes - maybe an infinite series! This hypothesis is gaining traction because it provides an explanation for the beginning AND the end. NB. My book (above) covers the universe evolution in some detail. ",

Being 3 dimensional creatures, we cannot imagine a place being space-less but according to the theory, there was in fact absolutely nothing. Then the universe evolved from a point. That point had all the energy, space, matter (Every thing that is in the universe now because that point WAS the universe). It expanded, and the space it had in it also expanded with it. The matter got separated from each other forming galaxies later and the process kept going. A few billion years later, here we are. Hope this explains the big bang theory in a nutshell. Fun Fact : The expansion is still going on. And our very precise and accurate calculations say that the expansion is accelerating. And it is happening at a speed faster than light. ",

Precise predictions of background radiation temperature, even before it was actually discovered, as well as recent findings suggesting that our universe was much hotter in the younger ages, support the Big Bang Theory.  What is Big Bang ? If we trace the Hubble expansion back in time, we conclude 1). All matters in the universe should be in a very small volume long time ago: if we trace back to t =0, the size of the universe is zero! 2). At t =0, all matters must be compressed into zero size.

The big bang was not the beginning of the universe we live in. Our universe has been here for probably infinity. Everything was already here when the big bang happened. Our universe was no different before the big bang. The big bang made all the galaxies spread out into space to where we see them today. Space itself is not expanding. Let me repeat that. Space is not expanding. The big bang was the only thing it could have been. A collision between two gargantuan objects. Where these two objects came from I have no idea. We as humans will never find out all the details about our universe but there is no reason we can't deduce what happened that created what we see today. These two objects were going extremely fast. The pressure and friction from the collision put all the matter in the plasma state the second the event happened. The galaxies are simply shrapnel from the collision. That's all. Each one had its own size, shape, rotational rate, and trajectory. That is why they are so different. Everything has done nothing but cool ever since. The main problem with the current theory was the implication that space was somehow involved with the expansion of the galaxies. That is the sole reason of the confusion that exists to this day. That assumption was made for religious reasons to be blunt. Edwin Hubble, the true pioneer of the expanding galaxies, never, ever believed in the big bang theory. For the reason I mentioned above, his thoughts on the process were completely ignored even though his opinion should have trumped all others. So, in a nutshell, the big bang was just two objects colliding. Einstein said a theory must be explained simply. Well, there it is. ",

We are just one of the results of this calculation after it has been calculated to a point equating to about 14 Billion years (from the last Big Bang). (N.B. Time does not really exist but is one of the rules of the calculation). There is no difference from our point of view to living in a REAL PHYSICAL UNIVERSE and to living in the mathematical concept of a universe, We can not tell the difference. Consciousness is local to one point and time in the model. Most points will have very little or none but for a few points which coincide with a critical part of a brain or possibly of a computer they have access to much more data through memory cells linked to that point Obviously a universe can be defined by many rules and a starting condition. Therefore there are an infinite number of universes but only a small percentage will evolve to the point that we experience. The Big Bang by my definition is the start of the calculation, which may have been way before the Big Bang that we can see evidence of in the background radiation. This other Big Bang (14 billion years ago approx.) may be part of a cycle of many such explosions but may have been the first. ",

Not only that - galaxies are moved away from us faster the further away from us they are. The way they are moving shows us that we aren\u2019t at a special place. Galaxies are moving away from each other. In every galaxy the distance galaxies will be seen to be rushing away. This means that the universe hasn\u2019t stayed the same in the past. When we calculate what happened in the past we find that about 13\u201314 billion years ago the universe was very dense and very hot. The universe was so hot that even atoms could not exist, and the particles that make up the nuclei of atoms were in pieces. Working forward again we can make calculations about what we would find if our understanding is correct. We can predict the proportions of hydrogen and helium and other light elements that would have been created. We get this right. We also predict that the universe would have been dark for hundreds of thousands of years because light can\u2019t get through clouds of gas if the atoms of that gas are split up (the universe was too hot for those atoms to form). Then, after hundreds of thousands of years, the universe cooled enough for the light to escape, and we predict that we should see the light today as microwaves. We do! And that is the best proof that the Big Bang really happened. ",

Since they fall into the category of a-priori knowledge, then current theories which obey the Law of Conservation of matter/energy must also be abandoned.

            "answer_text": "A brief question demands a brief answer :) The conditions behind what is popularly known as the Big Bang, in simplistic terms, comes from extrapolating the current expansion of the cosmos backward in time. Just as we can foresee how the universe will look billions of years from now, or tomorrow, so can we extrapolate back in time, and see how it looked yesterday and the day before that, etc. Compute the numbers, measure the observations, and it shows our observable universe was highly concentrated about 13,8 billion years ago; into an extremely hot and dense space.  A bit like a deflating balloon. At one point the balloon can deflate no more. The model leads us to a point where we can see no further back, and it leads us to a point where all the observable matter and energy in our universe was in a singular point.

The show is about a group of four like-minded individuals who work at CalTech, a private research university in Pasadena, California. They share similar interests in science-fiction, science fact and are awkward around women. The two main protagonists, Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper share an apartment. The apartment across the hall from theirs becomes vacant and a pretty girl moves in, who is an aspiring actress called Penny. The other two individuals are called Howard Wolowitz and Rajesh Koothrappali. They are all very tech savvy and have high IQ\u2019s. The show provides insight into how the four friends interact with Penny and how she helps them become more grounded with respect to social interactions in real-life situations. As time goes by, additional characters are introduced and we find out how they become part of the expanding group. While the show uses science and technology as set-ups for punchlines in the script, cameos from actual scientists and science-fiction actors have also contributed to its success. The show is currently airing its twelfth and final season. ",

The only logical answer is that \"nothingness\" existed before the creation.Since nothing ever may be created out of nothingness, the BB theory must be wrong.However, assuming that it is right, we should be able to confirm the model by astronomical observations. We cannot do this because these astronomical observations do not agree with the model.Regardless of additional assumptions (patches), for example, \"Inflation,\" Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and other \"tweaks,\" there currently is no BB-type model that agrees with all observations.Then there is the impossibility that everything in the cosmos was created in an instant. In essence, hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with several hundred billion stars, and each star with its planets, ever could have been created in an instant.Conclusion: The BB model is wrong!There is a much better model. The cosmological expansion is in the \"scale of existence\" rather than in space. There is no predetermined scale of things in the universe. The cosmos, with all its matter, may exist at any scale, and the world makes use of this \"new\" degree of freedom. I have shown in books and several papers that this Scale Expanding Cosmos (SEC) model is superior to the BB model. It agrees with all observations, and it eliminates Inflation, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy since this new model agrees with all observations. It also explains what is causing the inertial force that resists acceleration. And, it allows the derivation of Quantum Mechanics from General Relativity. However, the new SEC model forces revision of our current physics going back to Newton and is therefore strongly resisted by the academia. The SEC model has been published in several papers and books all over the world but has not yet received general acceptance.

That dramatic change that began the temporal continuity of the Universe we see today we term, \u201cThe Big Bang\u201d Simply put, it is a change in the Universe that is connected to our existence.

This observation supports the expansion of time and space within the universe and suggests that the universe previously had less spacetime and the mass was more densely packed.

From measuring this radiation we can determine how long the universe has been cooling since the Big Bang event.

Then in 1927 Georges Lemaitre proposed the big bang theoretical model of the expanding universe. In around 1930 astronomer Edwin Hubble found that all galaxies were flying away from each other in all directions as predicted by the model of the expanding universe. So scientists conjectured that in distant past (13.8 billion years ago) all the matter of the universe was confined to a single point called Singularity which exploded with a big bang. Then George Gammow and other scientists predicted hot big bang. They calculated the temperature of the cooled universe at present time. This was experimentally verified by Wilson and Penzias and later others to be 2.7 degree Kelvin. This established the big bang theory as a viable theory of creation. ",

The entire universe once existed in a highly compactified state. We know this because the average temperature we observe today is cold, 3 degrees above absolute zero, and the observation that the universe is expanding. If we run that movie backwards the we see a universe that is contracting and thus more dense. Anything that is compressed heats up thus, at earlier times the universe was necessarily hotter. The uniformity comes from observing that opposite ends of the universe today have almost exactly the same temperature even though those ends are separated by tens of billions of light-years, yet, in the past, must have existed in a state of thermal equilibrium. Put that all together and it spells Duh!? ",

Because current instruments don't allow astronomers to peer back at the universe's birth, much of what we understand about the Big Bang Theory comes from mathematical formulas and models. Astronomers can, however, see the \"echo\" of the expansion through a phenomenon known as the cosmic microwave background. While the majority of the astronomical community accepts the theory, there are some theorists who have alternative explanations besides the Big Bang \u2014 such as eternal inflation or an oscillating universe.

If that assumption is wrong then most of what we think we know about the universe ain't so. Well, Doppler effect is not the only cause of red shift.

Each of the main characters has problems with the opposite sex. Sheldon\u2019s lack of awareness is much worse than the others. Sheldon does not recognize why something he does is so awkwardly wrong, like referring to slavery when talking to a black Human Relations supervisor, or not realizing when he is putting out sexual signals to another guy (when he was trying to find a guy for Penny). I\u2019ve seen so many examples from my own life while watching this show. In fact, my sister started watching it because some of her kids have ADHD, recognized me in some of the BBT behaviors, then recommended that I start watching it, but I\u2019d already discovered it. I\u2019m sure there are many other answers to this question, but this is why I enjoy the show. ",

            "answer_text": "Before the formation of universe existed a consciousness. Then energy, matter, life and intelligence etc. were not created, but a program of creation was imbibed in this consciousness. When this consciousness decided to create universe, it broke itself in smallest possible particles known as GOD PARTICLES. It was like the seed of a tree that contains the entire software for sprouting and growth of the tree. The seed sprouts when all ingredients for its life are present. This also depends on the software imbibed in the ever existing consciousness i.e. when the creation would start, and when PRALYA (total destruction) would take place. The universe came in existence due to presence of that consciousness that we term as GOD (Generator, Operator and Destroyer). When these God Particles joined, the creation of universe started. Scientists have named this event as big bang. Energy, matter, life and other ingredients were produced at this point and started joining; thus creating the universe. This process is still continuing, and universes are being continuously created. ",

The 4 flights of stairs that you see in the building are actually a single floor, redecorated to depict different floors. You can catch this on certain youtube videos. Not only that, each and every room in the show has three walls, because cameras.  3. The equations that you see on the boards are real and come from the show\u2019s \u2018science consultant\u2019 David Saltzberg. He is also the one who comes with the science references in the show.  4. You might remember an episode in Season 2 where guys are looking for a member for their team and Rajesh mentions TV\u2019s Blossom (Mayim Bialik). Later on, she joins the show as Amy. Also, she\u2019s actually a neuroscientist. These are just some of the facts I know about TBBT. ",

So the time or the event when the expansion began, when all the known matter was accomodated at a single point (well it's inappropriate to say 'the time when' because it is belived that even time had a beginning during Big Bang), is termed as Big Bang.

This strong statement suggests the level of confidence in which the big bang theory, first advanced by Belgian physicist Georges Lema\u00eetre, is held by those who study these matters. However, you must not imagine that the big bang was\rlike the explosion of some gigantic firecracker and that, in principle at least, you could have stood to one side and watched. There was no \u201cone side\u201d because the Big bang represents the beginning of spacetime itself. From the point of view of\rour present universe, there is no position in space to which you can point and say, \u201cThe big bang happened there.\u201d It happened everywhere. Moreover, there was no \u201cbefore the big bang,\u201d because time began with\rthat creation event. In this context, the word \u201cbefore\u201d loses its meaning. We can, however, conjecture about what went on during succeeding intervals of time after\r the big bang. ",
