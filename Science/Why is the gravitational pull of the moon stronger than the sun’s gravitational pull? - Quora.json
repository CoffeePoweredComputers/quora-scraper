            "answer_text": "The gravitational pull between two bodies is proportional to the mass of either body and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The mass of the sun is around 27000000 times that of the moon. The sun is around 400 times farther than the moon. The square of this is 160000. So, obviously, the pull of the sun is much more than moon on the earth. However, if you are talking about the tides, they depend not upon the gravitational force, but on the rate of variation of the gravitational force with distance. This varies as the cube of the distance (since the differential of r exp -2 varies as r exp -3 Also the mass of a spherical object is volume times density. The volume varies as the cube of the radius. Therefore, the ratio of the masses of the sun and moon varies as the the cube of the ratio of their radii and as the ratio of their densities. Since the angle subtended by the sun and moon is the same (as viewed from the earth, it follows that the ratio r/d is the same for the sun and the moon. The net result is that the tidal forces of the sun and moon are simply proportional to the ratio of their densities, other factors simply cancel out. And here it is the moon which wins, its density being about 2.4 times that of the sun. Thus, the tidal force of the moon is stronger by the same factor. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t. Gravitational force diminishes over distance. The Sun is about 93 million miles from the Earth. Our Moon is an average of about 240 thousand miles from us. The Moon has about 1/6 the Earth\u2019s mass, hence, 1/6 the Earth\u2019s gravity. The Sun has 27 million times the mass of our Moon, hence, 27 million times it\u2019s gravity. The Moon is about 387.5 times closer to the Earth than the Sun is. So, at these respective distances, our Sun only exerts 67,677 times the gravitational force on the Earth than our Moon does. Still exponentially more. Due to tidal action, it may seem the Moon\u2019s gravity is stronger than the Sun\u2019s, but upon deeper observation, due to the frequency of the Moon orbiting the Earth, in relation to the Earths rotation, we find that the higher tides, are on the side of the Earth where the Moon and the Sun are more closely lined up, and the lower tides are on the opposing side of our planet.
