Perhaps you are unaware that climate change has happened before and is, in fact, always occurring? Yes, human activity has altered the time line of the change in climate , just as volcanos, comet or asteroid strikes, solar activity and other occurrences can and have altered it in the past. New science will have little to do with how we handle climate change. Just as humans have done in the past, we will alter our personal environments when possible and adapt as we have in the past. ",

In any case the idea is to remove carbon from the atmosphere either through regenerative agriculture or free air capture of carbon dioxide. Simply reducing emissions won\u2019t do the job, and we can\u2019t stop using fossil fuels overnight. ",
