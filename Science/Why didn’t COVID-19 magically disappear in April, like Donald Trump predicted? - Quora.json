            "answer_text": "Because it was never going to do so. Donald Trump, like many other arrogant and unintelligent people, take away parts of the narratives that they told, rather than listening to the entire body of work, reflecting upon what they have learned, and then making statements or decisions based upon their having analyzed the matter thoroughly. At some point, someone mentioned that SOME viruses seem to diminish when the weather grows warmer. Since Trump's main priority is his reelection to office, since analysis and introspection are not part of his makeup, and since he needs to \u201clike\" an idea before he deems it to be good, he latched onto that mentioning and transformed it to \u201cApril\u201d. He then repeated it (unwisely) on video where a permanent record of his having said it would be made. The reality is that COVID-19 makes its own time schedule, and it always has. The people around Trump who are not sycophants, have attempted to make him understand that, and they have all failed. The people who believe in Trump however take what he says as \u201cgospel\", and they anticipated that this pandemic would have been resolved by now. Trump never should have promised an end date, as he definitely informed that there wasn't one. However his need to be reelected and his limitations of intellect and character wouldn't allow him to appear to be uncertain, even when he was. He simply blurted out what sounded good to him, and then compounded that error by repeating it when he didn't need to do so ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, what I heard Trump say was that we don't know how weather will impact the virus. He went on to say how some viruses become less of a problem when the weather starts to warm up. So, since this is the first time the medical community has faced this virus nobody knew if warmer weather would help slow down the rate of infection or not. Trump hoped that in April the warmer weather would have a positive impact. I never heard Trump state as a fact that the virus would go away in April. So much of what Trump says gets twisted by the media when it is reported. They misquote him and edit the tapes in a way to make Trump look as bad as possible. Their behavior is shameful. Nobody did anything close to this with President \u201cIf you like your doctor you can keep your doctor\" Obama, not even Fox News. ",
