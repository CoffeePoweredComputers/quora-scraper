            "answer_text": "The advantages of archaeology are many. It can teach us so much about the past. Especially the way the average person lived. In most cases we know much about the lives of the important figures in history, but relatively little about how the lives of the average people. The ones who did most of the working, warring, hunting, farming, etc. Archaeology can fill in those blanks in history. As the late archeologist, James Deetz said, \u201cThe past can be seen most fully by studying the small things so often forgotten\u201d. The disadvantage is that archaeology is a destructive process. When excavating a site the archeologist is essentially destroying it. Sure, large structural remains such as foundations are often left intact, but generally when a site has been excavated, it\u2019s gone forever. That is why archaeologists painstakingly document every step of the process. Photographs, drawings, measurements to the fraction of an inch. Artifacts uncovered are documented precisely as to what depth and location they were found. Artifacts are often labeled so that future archaeologists can virtually reconstruct the site. Even if separated from the collection, the label written on an artifact will pinpoint where it was uncovered. Because it is a destructive process, on larger sites archaeologists will often leave a portion of the site unexcavated, preserving it for future archaeologists with hopefully better technology, techniques and a more thorough understanding of the site.

            "answer_text": "Archaeology allows us to build up a picture of our heritage in a way that traditional history cannot. Don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m an archaeologist and love history but pick up most history books and what do you see? The lives of royalty and the rich and famous, wars and other notable events. What you don\u2019t get is the sense of everyday life. Much of history doesn\u2019t mention the \u201ceveryday\u201d people like you and me and that is where archaeology comes in. Especially true for commercial archaeology in the UK you never know what you are going to find when you start to excavate a site and for the most part it\u2019s not high status buildings etc that we find, it\u2019s evidence of everyday life. So the advantages by excavating sites across the country we can build up a picture of everyday life, throughout the various time periods, for those not fortunate enough to be included in the history books. It allows us to explore our heritage in such a way that we can relate with those people whose life we are getting a small glimpse of 100\u2019s or 1000\u2019s of years after their time. The disadvantages, as was said in the previous answer, interpretation can be difficult but the overarching disadvantage is that archaeology is destruction. When you excavate a site you are removing that evidence. If it is not excavated and recorded correctly you cannot go back and do it a second time as the archaeology is removed or more often than not built on. ",
