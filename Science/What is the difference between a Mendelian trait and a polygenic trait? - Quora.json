            "answer_text": "Another exception to Mendel\u2019s rules is a polygenic inheritance, which occurs when a trait is controlled by more than one gene. This means that each dominant allele \"adds\" to the expression of the next dominant allele. Usually, traits are polygenic when there is wide variation in the trait. For example, humans can be of many different sizes. Height is a polygenic trait, controlled by at least three genes with six alleles. If you are dominant for all of the alleles for height, then you will be very tall. There is also a wide range of skin colour across people. Skin colour is also a polygenic trait, as are hair and eye colour. Polygenic inheritance often results in a bell-shaped curve when you analyze the population (Figure below). That means that most people fall in the middle of the phenotypic range, such as average height, while very few people are at the extremes, such as very tall or very short. At one end of the curve will be individuals who are recessive for all the alleles (for example, aabbcc); at the other end will be individuals who are dominant for all the alleles (for example, AABBCC). Through the middle of the curve will be individuals who have a combination of dominant and recessive alleles (for example, AaBbCc or AaBBcc).
