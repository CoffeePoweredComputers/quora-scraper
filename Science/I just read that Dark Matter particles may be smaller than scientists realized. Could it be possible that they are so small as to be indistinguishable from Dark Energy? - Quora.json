            "answer_text": "For \u201cscientists\u201d who slept through Gauge theory\u2026. Virtual particles are perturbations or simply the way we observe energy relative to matter. They can be infinitely divisible and require confinement in a more complex identity to have any degree of stability. Dark matter is a generic term for anything that does not emit or reflect light but is consistent with the contracting spacetime condition of gravity. That does not necessitate that this popular media term has any material validity. It suggests a simple spacetime-order association with material potential. Likewise, dark energy is the distribution of disorder. The order:disorder proportion is 1:e with about 4.9% in the middle being conventional matter anomaly. Quit looking at these things as if the fraction of the 4.9% you barely understand is representative of the rest of the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "Dark energy is not made of particles. It is not even a form of energy; \u201cdark energy\u201d is just a name that sounded cool. It is really a vacuum pressure, though that does translate into an energy density. They really are two completely different things. Also, there is *speculation* that dark matter might be composed of very small particles. There is also speculation that it is composed of large particles; I just heard a talk saying they could be as big as around 1 gram! The fact is, nobody knows what the dark matter particle is. But whatever it is, dark energy is completely separate from it. ",
