            "answer_text": "Dobereiner, a German chemist in 1829, arranged the elements in groups called Triads, as each contained three elements with similar properties. Newland, an English chemist, in 1864, classified 64 elements, known at that time, in increasing order of their atomic masses. He noticed that every eight element had some properties in common with the first one. The principle on which this classification is based was called the Law of Octaves. . ",
