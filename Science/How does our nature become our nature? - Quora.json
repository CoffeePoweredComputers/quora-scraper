            "answer_text": "I have no college degree or book knowledge about many or any topic but just from the many different experiences I've endured I believe that your nature is up to you. You are what you are because you allowed yourself to be that way. I mean this in a way as to either you choose to be an honest virtual, giving and caring person or you choose to lie, steal cheat, disrupt, corrupt, injure yourself and others, or do a mixture of good and bad..its all up to you. You may live amongst people or animals or both or no one at all. You are what you are depending upon the way you have been raised, and how you've learned to cope with however it was that you were brought up. Everyone has an ability to overcome lifes battles it's just the surroundings that could make a huge difference in the choices you may have or not have in dealing with everyday situations that are available if needed to be able to cope. I was raised or shall I say, if i had done something unacceptable to my father's expectation. His expectation of me is this..I am supposed to know everything since the day I was born. I'm supposed to have been born with the knowledge of an upstanding law abiding 21 year old whose priviledged to have a father such as he. Where in the world would he have an expectation as such. I mean who was I supposed to have learned all of this from. So no matter what went wrong in a home with 6 siblings including myself as being number 3 i was at fault, no questions asked, I am grounded for two weeks. He would \u201cground\" me. Which may I say was very harsh for me I say this because, he is a very cruel, nasty mouth sob.and he never had the facts of the matter and I never had a say or been able to plea my case\u2026not only was I unable to go out and play or what have you..but having to stay home not too bad if i would have been ordered to stay in my room but no most of the time he was out of a job and he was there also as a warden and a laziest man I know who in those days I was the virtual remote control all the while being verbally and mentally and just so much abuse. And I'd tell myself that I would never ever treat my own children or anyone this way. And guess what i lied. My first born got it really bad from me. I realized i had been doing to her what my father has done to me, but the good thing is that i could realize it and i acknowledged it and i hated myself for it especially now \u2026yet i would pray whenever i felt i was or actually realized what I've been doing I'd ask the lord to please help me and please forgive and help me to stop being what I learned to be from the abuse I've had please lord help me\u2026it took 18 years 18 years before i could have a true love bond between my daughter and i ",
