            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always had technology at my fingertips as a parent, so I can only speculate based on what I remember from my own childhood. What stands out most in my mind is the availability of information. When I was sick or hurt, my parents sought the advice of friends and family (my grandmother was a nurse) in addition to consulting with my physician. I, on the other hand, have a wealth of information available to me \u2014 not just the aforementioned resources, but also child-rearing websites, parenting forums, and medical reference sites. What would take my mother hours of research at the library to learn takes me 30 seconds with the internet. No one source has all of the answers all of the time, so it\u2019s helpful to me to have a variety of them at my disposal. Technology has also changed being a kid. When I was a child, I loved checking out books on craft techniques from the library. What I didn\u2019t realize until I was much, much older was how small our library was, and how little information it had compared to how much was actually available. My daughter, on the other hand, researches such things on YouTube. She is learning about making layered soap and creating swirled lip balm \u2014 things I never would have dreamed you could do at home. If you can imagine it, someone\u2019s already done it and posted a how-to video on the internet. And my child, who can\u2019t even read yet, is able to locate and watch these videos, then (with my help, of course) tries them out for herself. She\u2019s years ahead of me in this department, and it\u2019s all thanks to the internet. Her curiosity combined with her tech savvy have led her down some fascinating paths. She\u2019s taught me every bit as much as I\u2019ve taught her. ",

            "answer_text": "I can answer this question based on my recent experience with a newborn, but won't be much use past that.  Technology in many ways has enabled me to make more informed parenting decisions than ever possible in previous generations. When my mom was raising babies and needed advice, she asked her mom/peers, and that was that. I, on the other hand, have the internet and can research the bejesus out of every question I have about my baby. This means I have access to different types of peer groups that I can choose myself, and also to scientific and medical research that I can read and evaluate to benchmark parenting choices against current data-driven outcomes.  This dramatically and directly impacted my breastfeeding relationship with my child, and has informed other decisions such as bed sharing, baby wearing, setting up an adorable Montessori style bedroom, and other things that perhaps are not the norm for my parents or society at large, but very much conducive to my/my baby's needs.  Of course, same as w anything technology related it's also possible to overdo it, but by and large I would say technology has been an essential tool in my parenting arsenal.  ",
