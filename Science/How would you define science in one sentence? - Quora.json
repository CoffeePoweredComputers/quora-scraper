            "answer_text": "Biblically speaking this means \u201cwisdom\u201d -gift of knowledge. Science has many fields or branches of knowledge. Scientists are the so called \u201cthe gifted one\u201d who own special kind or highest level of knowledge in a particular field. Their abilities are rated above normal. When we have special talent that seems above the others\u2019, we should be belonged counted to the gifted persons like scientists. Why wisdom? Solomon has extra ordinary intelligence. The word wisdom focussing on his talent adhered to it. In slang they called it \u201cweird\u201d in a positive way. Meaning, it is so stranged or unusual. But oppossing to some christian beliefs, scientists are being treated as they are having under satanic and earthly knowledge, while they have been working for the benefits of mankind to make everybody happy. This the reason why we are having indulgences in life. Religions have nothing to do to thier kneeling members everyday. They suppress beliefs, posses member that their is only one God. Other religious groups also have claim they have also owned God. Another religions yell,\u201dmy God is the real God. The Lord of the Lords. (It includes the lord of the ring, drug lords, landlords, overlord, slumlord, milord, warlord\u2026) they preach that their Lord is understanding and leading them to save the unsaved. While we would notice from them that if you were not belonged in their congregation they dont want to mingle or join with. How can they find those they think \u201cthe unsaved\u201d? If you are not belonged to their congregation, they will no let you to marry their beautiful woman you love. Just go on dating and leaving in without matrimonial bond. They have been adhering to the old 10% tithing continue disregarding the law of tithing under new testament, because it just requires whatever can be afforded amount. Where can we get the 10%, from the gross or from the net income. Yes of couse from the \u201cgross\u201d. Why? Because you dont have left \u201cnet\u201d income all were left are just payslip and listings for accountabilities. Whe in the Bible can be seen, saying the thite must be from the gross income? \u2026 Ah they will retire you from the congregation. You are a goat not a lamb. Lambs must be dependent to the Shepherd. Ok close your eyes, say this\u2026blah blah, -say to your seatmate, i am glad to your prensence today\u2026, ok raise your hand, kneel, open you eyes\u2026.should be all eyes not only one eye. Cry! \u2026smile! \u2026throw out all the molded images that were patterned to God, just praise the roofs and praise the walls. Talking about Carved images patterned from God are the only available machine during that early age. (Like someone will grasp your nape to bump your face to a piece of stone or wood functions as copier machines today. ) There were no electronics camera to selfie ourselves during those era. Some heroes, their monuments are standing erected in plazas to commemorate them, your parents\u2019, wives\u2019 friends\u2019 pictures is in your wallet, propting to see and to remember them once in a while. Why they dont allow the carvings, but, ironically, the pictures today, they allow! The scripture says \u201c\u2019dont worship images\u201d (must be all kind that portrays images). Ironically, the scripture did not say put them (images) all to the garbage and throw them all into the river. (Well, there\u2019s Someone who happens to be, is drowning in the river, the thrown out image floated and saved him). Act like a child, they said, and follow the leader of the church! S___t\u2026 are you one of them, gullible? This means if you want to be saved dont use anymore your mind to think, let your leader to decide and plan about all your decisions in life, to your family completely. Lesser than than that, you will not be saved. Having hold a piece of 2 by 2 hardwood. I will smack his head into the pavement to sip and suck his two fishy eyeballs. Joke!\u2026Just practicing the gift of wisdom! Anyway\u2026I\u2019 ll just go back for bundles of words that need to be deleted or edited here, one of these days. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is the study of how the world works by way of what is known as the scientific method. It involves. Studying some aspect of the world.Developing a hypothesis about how it works.Using that hypothesis to produce predictions about future results.Look for those predictions.If those predictions fail then the hypothesis is falsified and should be abandoned.If the predictions succeed hypothesis is supported.If the predictions are generally successful but not quite the hypothesis can be modified make adjustments for the discrepancy.The key point to science is producing a testable hypothesis and one that can be falsified. Now it is commonly claimed that such a qualification would exclude God from consideration however this is not an accurate representation. Yes, you can not falsify the existence of God in the general sense of the concept, however, is this not exclude including God in specific cases. One example involves concluding that something was an act of God because what we do know excludes other alternatives. This is not a god of the gaps which is claiming God based on our ignorance. It is coming to the conclusion FaceTime what we do know. Such a conclusion can, in theory, be falsified by the discovery of new information that provides a viable alternative. Another example involves including God in a specific hypothesis or theory that is itself falsifiable. In such a case while the existence of God himself is not falsifiable, the specific hypothesis or theory is. If the predictions of that specific hypothesis or theory are verified that would tend to not only verify the specific hypothesis or theory but also the existence of God. By the way, such hypotheses and theories do exist. The key to understanding what science is the scientific method and falsifiability. As long as you are approximately following the scientific method and are producing specific hypotheses and theories that are falsifiable it should be considered science regardless of its agreement with the mainstream scientific community, or the basis of the theory.
