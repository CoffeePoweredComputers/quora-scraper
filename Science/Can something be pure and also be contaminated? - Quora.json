            "answer_text": "Q. Can something be pure and also be contaminated? A. Yes, it can be, Sam Holden. Some answers to this question reflect semantics rather than science. A better choice of words would be pure vs impure. A \u201cpure\" substance is homogeneous and is of uniform composition and properties throughout the whole sample. An \u201cimpure\u201d substance is a type of mixture, so melting points can be used to find out if a substance is pure or impure. Impure substances tend to have a slightly lower melting point than the pure substance, and a broader melting temperature range [1]. The substances have fixed boiling and melting points. A pure substance usually participates in a chemical reaction to form predictable products [2]. No two pure compounds can have the same melting point. Two pure compounds can have the same melting point [3]. The contaminant comes from external sources, not internal. In 1956 and on, the chemical drug \u201cthalidomide\u201d was marketed in Europe and Canada to pregnant women for morning sickness. This drug was pure in that its chemical composition was C13 H10 N2 O4. Unfortunately, unknown to chemists then was the fact that the drug was a racemic mixture, and consisted of two isomers; 55% and 66% for the (R)-(+)- and (S)-(\u2212)-enantiomers, respectively. R-thalidomide is the bioactive form of the molecule.  The S-form was the impurity in this pure substance. It caused teratogenic effects on the unborn during development. \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf [1] Pure or impure? - How are chemicals separated and tested for purity?

            "answer_text": "Sure. \"Pure\" is a word that requires context. Theres a difference between being a pure person and pure evil. You can have pure steel, but if you wanted iron, you have iron contaminated with carbon. Pure water is very nice unless you're drowning in it, in which case you're probably wishing your oxygen wasn't contaminated with hydrogen. For that matter, you can \"contaminate\" water in all sorts of useful and delicious ways. Pure fluorine is deadly, evil stuff. But fluorine \"contaminated\" with certain other substances is highly useful, giving us such things as fluoride and Teflon. ",
