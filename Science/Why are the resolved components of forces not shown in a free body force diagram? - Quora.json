            "answer_text": "It depends on the purpose of the free body diagram. If you are taking a test, and the question is designed to test whether you understand what forces are present, the question will usually specify to draw forces, not components. This is to test for example if you know that the force of gravity on an inclined plane points straight down, and not along the plane. However, when you are solving the problem, it is perfectly acceptable to draw components, on a different diagram if needed to preserve the original diagram for the grader. ",
