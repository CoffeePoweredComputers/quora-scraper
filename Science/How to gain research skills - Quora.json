            "answer_text": "By researching! This is one of those things that you improve upon through practice. But I would recommend:  Read (and cite!) credible sources. If you are researching the implications of a specific gene on the production of a protein, then you are most likely not going to find credible information on the Dailymail.Leave your opinions out of it. Believe it or not, many people intermingle opinions with research or let their own opinion skew their results. You have to remain unbiased when conducting research.Study statistics. A course or two in elementary statistics will teach you basic fundamentals on how to gather and document your data, as well as manipulate and organize it. You will also discover patterns easier this way.Learn calculus. Calculus will help immensely in measuring the changes and interrelationships between concepts (e.g., how the migration of birds affect the insect population of an ecosystem) and measure instantaneous rates of change. Read journals. Read others' research and study their methodologies. PLoS is an excellent suite. They also do not look for \"major\" articles that would gain the most attention; rather, they focus on research that was conducted ethically and according to proper methodology. Revise. After you conduct your research, revise it. Make sure you have everything organized and accurate; include plenty of detail. Make your paper aesthetically pleasing. People want to read papers that are beautifully written. If you propose some theoretical paper on the impact dark matter has on galaxy development, people will want the details and specifications. Also, do not be hesitant on explaining your procedures. Follow the scientific method:Make an observation.Ask a question or suggest a theory.Research.Construct a hypothesis (if X, then Y).Test the hypothesis.Analyze the data and draw a conclusion.Revise if necessary.Repeat (trials must be able to be replicated with the same results). Communicate the results.",

Skim reading is a brilliant technique; if you don't know it Google it and it might seem common to you or other people on Quora, but you need it. It'll save time deciphering loads of information you see on a screen and enable you to realise when you need to spend time looking at a document or to pay your attention elsewhere!  It takes practice to be good at researching because you learn common ways of finding the necessary information. If you're struggling, break your objectives down and research small things one at a time as whatever you're researching could be difficult to find presuming there is no secondary research to analyse; which brings me onto my next point. SECONDARY RESEARCH: I hope you're familiar with this and this is a way of using other people's research to develop your own. It's not stealing or cheating providing you don't copy it blatantly word for word. Read through what others in the same field have done and tailor it towards your research goals. Then go out and find your information using the SR as a guide to follow if you're struggling. ",

Asking good questions does two things for you: It engages your interest, because you have a question you want the answer to.It pushes you to find the answer. In most cases someone has already answered that question, that is good. Read their answer. Do you agree or diagree? Does it actually answer your question? Occasionally, no one has answered your question. That is great, because now you get to do some original research! Almost always to get to your answer, you will lean on the work of others. Those are citations. Then you get to push the envelope a little and add to our knowledge! By engaging your interest in answering questions, you are automatically forced to do research of all kinds. By doing research over and over, again and again, you will get better and better at it. ",

Many discoveries these days require cross disciplinary knowledge.Ask questions whenever you have the chance to clear your doubts. If you don't understand something in a journal paper, ask the author of the paper if you meet them at a conference, for example. Ask your colleagues. Be a sponge for information.For research, it's important to ask the right questions. This is something that usually takes experience. Designing the right experiment is usually the most difficult (in terms of thinking) task.When you travel to conferences make contacts. One day you may collaborate, and this can lead to more /better research output.Write and present in a clear and compelling way. This is just something that comes from practice.

            "answer_text": "The Web is a big place, harbouring at least 70 million websites consisting of at least  19 billion individual pages and that's just an estimate. With so much information floating around it can be quite difficult to filter out the noise from the good stuff. This is where search engines come into the picture. Everybody who uses the web knows about Google and Yahoo; in fact people are so familiar with these search engines that the word search and the word Google are almost interchangeable. How many times have you 'googled' for cheap flights or searched for that song you heard on the radio? It all gets a bit harder when you are looking for something very specific. Sometimes you might need to find information on a person, a place or a name but searching for John Smith or Church st London will return too many results that have absolutely nothing to do with what you want. Maybe you are looking for a particular page on BBC - Home or a specific profile on a social networking site like myspace? Maybe you have to find out something a little bit more complicated, for example, your employer wants to know how many websites reference your company website. It is possible to find just about any information you may need provided you know how to use the tools available to you. So what are these tools? Let's look and see what Google gives us, starting with the basics. The Basic Search QueryMost of us are familiar with this kind of query because it's the way you would usually search with Google. For example, if you were looking for a dental holiday in Poland \u2013 yes they do exist - you would type the following into Google: dental holidays Poland As if by magic you are now on your way to getting a \u00a31000's worth of root canal surgery for \u00a3400, thanks to Google. Ok, I admit there is nothing too spectacular about that search, anyone can do it, so let's move on to something more interesting. The Phrase SearchPhrase searches use quotation marks to tell Google that you are looking for a specific phrase rather than a bunch of keywords. This can come in handy when you are looking for headlines or a something that contains a specific phrase or combination of words. A good way to test this out is to use phrases based around your name, for example: \u201cMichael has a\u201d\u201cMichael is\u201d\u201cMichael was sitting\u201d Try these phrases with your own name, always using quotation marks to tell Google that you are looking for a phrase. As you can see this is a very useful query and it can be used in conjunction with other types of queries as I will show you later. Negative TermsThe next type of query uses 'negative terms'. You would use a negative term to exclude certain words from a search. This is helpful when you are searching for something that has more than one meaning or if you are trying to clean up a search by excluding something that keeps appearing but is not relevant to you. You perform this sort of search by putting a \u2013 sign in front of words which you want excluded. For example: bass -music This query is more likely to find information about fish than bass guitars. Another example could be \u201cMichael Hall is\u201d -AnthonyThis query will return all pages that have a sentence with the phrase \u201cMichael Hall is\u201d but will exclude any pages that have the name Anthony Michael Hall, or indeed pages with the name Anthony. Go on, try it out. Spend 10 minutes trying different combinations of negative terms, phrase searches and regular queries. Once you get the hang of it you can move on to the next section. Advanced Google OperatorsI can hear you asking: \u201cWhat on earth is an advanced Google operator?\u201d Well I can tell you for sure that its not a person sitting in a call center in Bangalore and its definitely not a Google employee skilled at surgery. Bad puns aside, advanced Google operators aren't really as scary as you might think. They are simply commands that you include in your search to tell Google where and how to look for the information you want. Back to the FutureThe first advanced operator we are going to look at is the cache: query. This operator lets you look back in time at a website. Google regularly caches or backs up entire websites. This is usefull if you are looking for outdated information or information that has since been removed from a web page. For example, try typing in the following query into Google: cache:bbc.co.uk The page you get back is a cached page. In the case of an important site like the BBC it is probably only a day or two old, still helpful if for some reason you need to look into the past. Another much more efficient way of retrieving archived copies of websites is to use the WayBackMachine at Digital Library of Free & Borrowable Books, Movies, Music & Wayback Machine, where you will find almost every page on the net archived since the 1990's. This is a very helpful research tool, especially when digging around news sites. I can relate to thatThe related: query is one of my favourite Google queries and probably one of the most useful when doing any sort of research. This query is used to find sites that contain similar information. This is an excellent feature to use if you are comparing information or looking for alternate sources of the same information. For example when I type related:bbc.co.uk into Google it returns a list of news sites similar to BBC - Home. You can even do this with specific pages. If I search for related:bbc.co.uk/weather/5day.shtml then Google returns a list of pages containing UK weather forcasts. Try it for yourself. Copy the address of a webpage and paste it into Google with the word related: in front of it. You don't have to have the http://www bit to make it work. Here are some others for you to try: related:wikipedia.com will return a list of sites similar to or some how related to Wikipedia. related:metro.co.uk will return a list of sites similar to Metro, mostly newspaper websites. related:news.independent.co.uk/uk/legal/ will return a list of sites that Google thinks is similar to the Independent's legal news page. Easy Info!The info: operator is the next logical step from the advancedsearch operators we have discussed so far. This operatorproduces a list of links that essentially will return the sameinformation as the advanced operators, as well as some others.Try typing in: info:institutelegalsecretaries.com This returns Google's entry for Institute of Legal Secretaries and PAs Home Page as well as a list of links to retrieve further information about the site. The Ultimate DictionaryEvery body knows someone who is a walking dictionary, unfortunately they are normally never around when you need them! Enter our new best friend Google, with its define: operator. To look up a word or phrase in seconds simply choose a word or phrase and put the operator define: in front of it. define:civil litigationdefine:intestatedefine:reverberationdefine:general motors corsadefine:Tony Blair As you can see this is a very powerful tool which works in many languages and can give you a lot more information than a normal dictionary. Query modifiers and other fun tricksSome times you might need to search a specific site for information or even look for web addresses that contain certain words. This is where you use a kind of operator called a query modifier. Lets start by finding all the pages relating to Jamie Oliver on the BBC website and no other sites. To do this I would use the site:operator. Give it a try: site:bbc.co.uk Jamie Oliver As if by magic every page relating to Mr Oliver appears on the screen. What if you want to find every page on the Beeb about Jamie but you don't want the pages about Jamie vs Boris Johnson? The answer is easy, use the site: operator with some negative terms. Here we go: site:bbc.co.uk Jamie Oliver -Boris -Johnson Another cool query modifier is the intitle: operator which lets you find all pages with certain words or phrases in their title: intitle:Jamie Oliver See how this query brings up all the webpages with Jamie Oliver in the title. Now, what if you want to find all pages on a certain site that have Jamie Oliver in the title? Its easy, just use a combination of site: and title: in your query: site:bbc.co.uk intitle:Jamie Oliver Get me that file!The final operator we will be learning about is incredibly useful if you are looking for a particular kind of file. This could be a PDF or Word document, a picture, a zipped folder or even music. How do I perform this amazing query, you ask? The answer is that you use the filetype: operator. Simply type filetype: into Google followed by the file type you are looking for. Here are some examples: filetype:doc for Word documentsfiletype:pdf for PDFsfiletype:zip for zipped folders Of course, typing in filetype:doc on its own isn't much use because you end up staring at a list of every Word document on the internet in no particular order. Try these two queries instead: filetype:doc last will and testamentfiletype:pdf last will and testament As you can see, these queries are much more helpful. They return PDFs and documents with the terms 'last will and testament' written inside them. You will even notice some templates for Wills as well as actual Wills of actual people. I'm sure you are starting to see some potential here. Let's try using the site: operator alongside the filetype: operator and see what we dig up: site:bbc.co.uk filetype:pdf employment contract Jackpot! A list of employment contract related PDFs appears. There are even some actual contracts listed, ready to be signed. With this nifty trick you can search huge sites for the forms you want in seconds. Over to youSearching using Google's advanced operators opens up a whole new world of information. All it takes is a little creativity and you can probably find just about any information you need, from names and telephone numbers to specific documents on specific sites.

You have to ask \"why\" or \"how\", then you will be able to know what you want to know and after that you just have to simply find the answer.Student often think that they require writing skills but I would oppose it as there is always a set pattern of the paper and you have to follow the headings in the same sequence, just that you have to narrate it in your own words.You need to have the knowledge of what you are going to research and to do that you will need to read some articles from the google scholar.In the end, research paper just require your time and dedication and if you do so you will surely come up with a good research paper.
