For Example: When you are playing Fortnite and it was a 1v1 and you were going to loot a guy u just killed. But unfortunately, there was one little bastard who just had to place a trap in the his base and it totally fucked you up. That is the moment, where you throw your mouse/controller and your headset, ripping your chair and smashing your keyboard. And as a result, you make a tornado, coming right from downstairs and seeing the phenomenon you have made, beats the shit out of u and leaves after it grounds you for breaking those expensive items. And that's really how a phenomenon happens. Yeah\u2026 ",
