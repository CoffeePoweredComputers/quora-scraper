            "answer_text": "For those suffering from a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the desire for more oxygen can be a demanding one. Although there are options available for increasing oxygen through means such as oxygenators and air purifiers, there are a variety of natural alternatives for increasing air quality that is beneficial for both body and mind. The Lung Health Institute believes the home should foster an environment of good health and well-being, and with your health in mind, we\u2019ve compiled a list of the top 5 plants for increasing oxygen indoors. Areca Palm As with all plants, the Areca Palm is biologically engineered to take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. However, what sets the Areca Palm apart is its ability to also purify the environment it\u2019s placed in by removing dangerous chemicals such as formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene. Snake Plant a.k.a. Mother-In-Law\u2019s Tongue Considered highly efficient in oxygen production, the Snake Plant otherwise known as the Mother-In-Law\u2019s Tongue is unique for its nighttime oxygen production, and ability to purify air through the removal of benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene, and toluene. Money Plant Featured by NASA, the Money Plant is renowned for its ability to remove chemicals and other pollutants from the air, specifically benzene, formaldehyde, xylene, and toluene. However, despite the benefit of its high purification rate, this plant is toxic to cats, dogs, and small children if its leaves are ingested. Gerbera Daisy (Gerbera Jamesonii) Arguably the prettiest entry on the list, the Gerbera Daisy is often used as a decorative element in gardening. However, the Gerbera Daisy is also distinct for its ability to produce high levels of oxygen at night while removing harmful chemicals, such as benzene and trichloroethylene. Beneficial for those suffering from sleep apnea and breathing disorders, keep this one on the nightstand for better sleep. Chinese Evergreens The Chinese Evergreen is one of the most common household plants and for good reason. This plant emits a high oxygen content while purifying indoor spaces of harmful chemicals such as benzene, formaldehyde, and other toxins. As its name suggests, it is quite popular in China specifically for its high efficiency in removing harmful pollutants from the air.

            "answer_text": "The leaves of a plant are what produces oxygen via photosynthesis a process that converts sugars, water and co2 into oxygen. Therefore a plant with more leaves will produce more oxygen. The larger the plant with the larger surface area of leaves will produce more oxygen then another. For a house plant that would be a Areca palm or fern as it has a huge amount of leaf surface area in comparison to required pot size / root ball size. In the wild - bamboo or large trees will produce the most oxygen but also require a lot of space. Plants that clean air by eating the most Co2 are the Neem plant, aloe vera and also the Areca palm. Co2 is a plant food and is essential for production of greenhouse produce such as tomatoes and bell peppers. The more Co2 there is the more the plants can grow. The larger a forest will grow based on Co2 available and thus it will create more oxygen as it can photosynthesise more. This is the balance of natural law. ",
