            "answer_text": "One must remember the basic rule: An object that floats in a liquid of higher density, it displaces some volume of the liquid. The mass (not the volume) of this displaced liquid is the same as that of the object. So, if the object\u2019s density (and, hence, its mass) is zero, then it will displace no liquid, and it will float with 100 % of its volume above the liquid line. If, on the other hand, the object has a density higher than that of the liquid, it will sink in the liquid. In such case, the volume (not weight) of the displaced liquid will be the same as that of the object. ",

            "answer_text": "Because buoyancy (the governing phenomenon around specific gravity and the ratios of densities of liquids in addition to the governing phenomenon of floatation of a solid) dictares (this is known as Archimedes Principle) that the force of buoyancy will equal the weight of the displaced liquid. Even for extremely light objects, their weight isn't zero. So, they still need to displace some liquid. They do this by having part of their volume submerged. Buoyancy then creates the required equilibrium offsetting their weight. ",
