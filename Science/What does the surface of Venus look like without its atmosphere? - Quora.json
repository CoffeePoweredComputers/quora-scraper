            "answer_text": "Atmosphere is a major factor in shaping the land of a rock planet like Earth or Venus. The Venusian atmosphere is about 100 times more massive than that of the Earth and is made mostly of carbon dioxide. This means a runaway green house effect on Venus has caused its surface temperature skyrocketed to about 860\u00b0F. That\u2019s more than twice as hot as the kitchen oven and almost enough to melt aluminum cook ware. That\u2019s hotter than Mercury, which is closer to the Sun than Venus. The consequences are Water cannot exist on the surface. There is no ocean, no lake and no river to shape the surface. The result is flatness. The land in Hawaii is flat, even though the rise and fall is steeper than anywhere else in the world. It\u2019s because the land in Hawaii is covered by greens that prevent the soil from being removed. Venus is flatter than Hawaii (but with no greens) because without water there is not much land-moving force.The thick CO2 air on Venus is as heavy as the 3000 ft deep oceanic water on Earth. The sun light cannot reach that depth of water on Earth or the thick air on Venus, so it\u2019s twilight all year around. Venusians don\u2019t get to see the Sun, even though Venus gets more sunlight than Earth. Not enough sunlight means there is no daily temperature change, another land-shaping force that is deprived.Because of the mass of the air and no temperature change, the wind there is 10 times slower than the Earth wind. All the wind-caused land formation is not there either.The thick air also causes meteorites to burn quicker. Only big meteorites can reach the ground. Therefore, Venus is much less pockmarked than the Moon.So, the atmosphere does all the negative things on the Venus land formation.That leaves volcanoes as the only driving force on Venus. Volcanoes there are several times more active than the Earth\u2019s. Remember, there is no water; the crust is stiff. But the lava flow from volcanoes doesn\u2019t do much, simply because even as high as 860\u00b0F is not enough to keep lava liquefied.No water leads to no continental drift or tectonic motion on Venus. That means another driving force of land formation is missing. Their land age (~500 million years) is five times longer than ours. Yes, all continents on Earth are about 100 million years old; after that, they get regenerated.So, without its atmosphere, Venus may still have the same surface, hot as hell and flat boring as hell in daytime, and cold as hell at night like Mercury (and Venus has long nights, 60 Earth days long). Here is a pic of Venus landscape,  with a vertical 22.5 times exaggeration, probably taken by Magellan orbiter in 1991. Note added on 2020.10.16. The wind in the upper atmosphere (20km or higher) of Venus can reach 360 km/h (or 220 mph) due to a super rotation which is not yet fully understood. Usually self spin is the major cause of winds, but Venus spins \u2212243.025 times slower (retrograde) than Earth.",

            "answer_text": "Its very rocky. The Venera 13 images are surprisingly clear considering they were taken back in 1982. NASA never landed a probe on Venus. They took shots of Venus on a flyby to the sun which showed us images of a swirling atmosphere. However, the USSR sent a series of probes to explore Venus between 1961 and 1984, some of these landing on the surface of Venus. Venera 13 transmitted the first images. There\u2019s a ground level shot of Venus here at the European Space Agency website Surface of Venus seen by Venera 13 but there\u2019s plenty more to find if you google \u2018images\u2019 for Venera 13. I\u2019ve read that the atmosphere on Venus is very thick - \u2018as heavy as water 3000 feet deep on Earth\u2019 - nevertheless these pics show the atmosphere is still transparent to light. The surface of Venus appears optically clear like Earth and Mars in the Venera 13 photographs. I should add that there\u2019s evidence Venus is still volcanically active, with recent lava flow in one region of the planet. There\u2019s a video of a flyover of Idunn Mons here Flying over Idunn volcano on Venus - this put together from two different sources of data collected from NASA Magellan spacecraft. ",
