            "answer_text": "Human reproduction in space. We did an experiment with rats a few years back. The rats had no problem figuring out how to have sex in space in micro-gravity. Many of the female rats concieved. But female rats have the ability to self terminate a pregnancy and reasorb the fetus if conditions are not good for giving birth. In this experiment all of the female rats that had become pregnant terminated their pregnancy. We are not certain why. Fetal development can be profoundly effected in space. The female is exposed to more cosmic radiation leading to a greeter possibility of genetic damage to the fetus. There is also the question of bone and muscle development in a microgravity environment. A baby born into a micro-gravity environment would not develope the muscle tone and none density to survive in gravity. For these reasons great efforts have been made to prevent conception in space. In fact, to this day, no human sex has been acknowledged in space by any of the world's space agencies. They go on about the lack of privacy and how they keep the astronauts busy. Even the one married couple sent up together in the shuttle denied any such experiments. If sex in space has occured, the astronauts have been disciplined enough to not talk about it. ",
