            "answer_text": "There are different ways to look at this question, under the framework of general relativity. The first way is the standard explanation: the escape velocity just outside the event horizon of a black hole exceeds the velocity of light itself. But no real body may accelerate beyond the speed of light, as per special relativity, and hence, bodies that fall into the event horizon can never make it back once inside. This also means, interestingly, that near a black hole, motion in space becomes uni-directional (towards the centre of the black hole), just like our regular uni-directional \u201cmotion\u201d in time which we perceive as the irreversible transition from order to disorder. The second way is somewhat similar, but it is more instructive when one desires to delve into the math of general relativity. The distribution of matter and energy, in space, distorts or \u201ccurves\u201d the geometry of spacetime itself, as given by the contracted equation, [math]G_{\\mu \\nu}=\\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu \\nu}[/math] The L.H.S. of the above equation is the so-called Einstein tensor, which tells us about the geometry or curvature of spacetime. And this is linearly affected by the term on the R.H.S., called the stress-energy-momentum tensor, which tells us about the distribution of matter and energy in a given region of spacetime (which leads to a \u201csmoothening\u201d of the exact configuration of matter and/or energy, making General Relativity a non-localized formulation of physical laws). Now, certain solutions to these equations (which are actually a set of 10 non-linear second-order partial differential equations) show that for a specific density of matter/energy in a body, the curvature of spacetime becomes such that geodesics in space become closed curves. A geodesic is the shortest path between two points considering the curvature of spacetime, and which is followed by light, and in GR, it is described by the geodesic equation: [math]\\frac{d^2x^\\beta}{d\\tau^2}+\\frac{\\partial x^\\beta}{\\partial \\xi^\\alpha}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\xi^\\beta}{\\partial x^\\mu \\partial x^\\nu}\\frac{\\partial x^\\mu \\partial x^\\nu}{\\partial \\tau^2}=0[/math] Physically, this means that if light is shone along these geodesics, it will move along closed loops which are actually the geodesic projections in three-dimensional space. In other words, light would keep circling the body along these curves! And such a curve with the minimum radius (i.e. closest to the centre of mass) is what we call the event horizon. Within this radius, it can be shown that all geodesics for bodies with mass lead right into the centre of the black hole - no matter how much these geodesics are linearly warped by supplying the body with kinetic energy. So any body is trapped within this region bound by the event horizon! ",

            "answer_text": "Well I saw some answers and all were nice ! But I think the essence of the question is changed from \u201cwhy\u201d to \u201chow\u201d . If you ask why, then here is the simplest explanation(from class 11 knowledge) : We know that the escape velocity of any particle is - u=\u221a(2GM/R) Where: M = mass of the body from which the particle is trying to escape . R = Radius of the same body . G=gravitational constant [6.67 \u00d7(10^-11) N (m^2)/(kg^2)] So if we are familiar with the formation process of a black hole, the star collapses on itself, thus the radius decreases significantly but the mass remains same. Now here the masses and radius changes are some serious number ( like our sun's mass .. 6\u00d710^24 kg and radius almost 700000 km ). If the radius decreases to such a number that the ratio G/R becomes almost infinite then escape velocity surpasses the speed of light. Hence even light can't escape anymore. Thus disallowing any other particle in motion with velocity v ( as v<<c) NOTE: the sun can't form a black hole because of limits that makes yellow dwarfs like our sun impossible to turn into a black hole or neutron star. The limit is CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT which I will not discuss here. . ",

            "answer_text": "Any thing which is made up of matter would curve the space time around it. And a black hole Is also made up of matter as far as it has been studied so it also curves the space time. But the thing strange about black holes is that they are soo dense that they curve the space time infinitely. This curvature affects time and space around the black hole. A black hole is born when a star which has mass more than the Chandrashekhar limit explodes into a supernova spreading the stellar mass to hundreds of light years. The outer layers of the Star are blasted off and the core is crushed into itself which forms the black hole. This crushing of core of the star makes the black hole almost infinitely dense. Therefore, the density ie. a lot of mass in small volume of black hole is responsible for the immense gravitational field of black hole. Einstein\u2019s equations proved that only an object which is travelling at a speed more than cosmic speed limit(the speed of light) can escape the event horizon(boundary of a black hole). ",
