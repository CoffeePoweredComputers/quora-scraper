            "answer_text": "Well, at standard pressures, and temperatures, dihydrogen, and dioxygen are GASES, whereas water is a LIQUID. Now consider the intermolecular forces that operate between each set of molecules. Dioxygen and dihydrogen gases, and thus there is LITTLE to NO intermolecular interaction, and in fact given a molar quantity of these we can advance state functions that inter-relate pressure, volume, and temperature. On the other hand, for water, a SIGNAL INTERMOLECULAR force operates, i.e. intermolecular hydrogen-bonding. And this occurs when hydrogen is bound to a STRONGLY electronegative element, viz. nitrogen, or fluorine, or OXYGEN. Because oxygen is quite electronegative, water acts as a molecular dipole, as the oxygen polarizes electron-density towards itself\u2026and we can attempt to represent this\u2026 [math]^{+\\delta}H-\\stackrel{\\delta-}O-H^{\\delta+}[/math] \u2026and in the bulk phase, these dipoles line up, and this interaction constitutes a potent intermolecular force \u2026 [math]H-O-H \\cdots OH_{2} \\cdots OH_{2} \\cdots[/math] Note that ammonia, [math]NH_{3}[/math], and hydrogen fluoride, [math]HF[/math], also have unusually elevated boiling points attributable to this hydrogen-bonding interaction. You should look up the normal boiling points, and compare them to the hydrides of the LOWER Group 15, and Group 17 hydrides\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Every element, every molecule has a gas, a liquid and a solid phase based on pressure and temperature. Earth\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d temperature and pressure ranges dictate gas phase for hydrogen and oxygen; liquid phase for water. That is the only answer. And that is the ONLY reason hydrogen and oxygen are gasses but water is a liquid. At above 100\u00b0C Hydrogen, Oxygen and water are all gasses. At below O\u00b0C water is a solid while the Oxygen and Hydrogen are gasses. At -259.14\u00b0C Hydrogen, Oxygen and are liquids. Water is solid. But we don\u2019t exist in THOSE surroundings. Other planets, stars, moons, asteroids and comets will have varying \u201cnormal\u201d temperatures and pressures. But for our \u201cnormal\u201d pressures and temperatures hydrogen and oxygen are gasses. And water is a liquid. ",
