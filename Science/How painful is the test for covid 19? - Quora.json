            "answer_text": "Hmm Disclaimer as of now the only COVID test Ihave had was the Red Cross doing an antibody test from my regular blood donation. they started that in June doing that to all blood donations. Right after my May donation. So August It was done and my next will be October for the 60 day time inbetween donations. But my wife is a healthcare worker in a nursing home. She/they had the nose tests twice during the summer due to false positive cases. After the late August federal mandating of weekly test for nursing home and similar facilities they now get tested every week based on the county location positivity rate the facility is in. So yes my wife now gets them a lot with all of her co workers. and she has had family members and others she knows outside of work go through those \u201cDrive through\u201d sites each state runs. and i have male freinds whos wives work in nursing homes in their home towns separate from my wife who works in the facilities in her home town before our marriage. Bottom line Ill cut to the chase. NO ONE! NOT at any facility doing the mandatory testing sites say its \u201cjust uncomfortable\u201d But hurts like hell. My stepson had it done because he got the flu and missed 3 days at work but his boss refused to let him come back unless he took a test and said it was hell and never again. If he gets sick he will stay home and take the two week quarantine rather then take the test and go back to work early with a negative like last time My wife hates the test and actually talked about quitting and she has been at the same job 20years this month. She loves the residents but hates that GD nose test. She does say the nurses at her facility are \u201cgentle hell\u201d compared to the state run drive through tests. Sometimes when the work schedules a test when some employees are off that day they either have to come to work for the test or go through the drive through when it works for them later. Those that took the drive through swore never again. As bad as the nurse at work tests are the guy that did the drive through tests was brutal. I dont know how they each did it but every employee who did both said they will make it to work come hell or high water then ever go through the drive through guy again. Another CNA at a different facility told her husband it hurts worse for smaller people because the nasal passage is smaller then it is for larger people. So either the people doing the tests are in a hurry and being sloppy or very badly trained and causing more pain then the \u201cjust uncomfortable\u201d those here saying it is. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it is not painful to be tested for the COVID-19, the laboratory identifies the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens. It's a quick process and not a painful one. But how to decide whether to test or not. People who are suffering fro mid illness and are able to recover at home with a medical facility may not need to test.There is no treatment specifically approved for people who have COVID-19.Testing is going more than where someone test positive and then the whole society will be tested.If you are tested positive and then proper medical care is there and you will be totally isolated. But if you test negative that does not mean that you are perfectly fine the symptoms of COVID-19 will show slowly after 14 to 15 days. So it is very important to take care and if you find any symptoms then consult medical attention as soon as possible. The government was doing their best to keep the people safe and healthy but if people stay home and help coordinate with the government and fight with this united then we can recover from this. ",
