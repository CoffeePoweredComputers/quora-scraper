            "answer_text": "What happens when the band gap shrinks with temperature? Do the valence and conduction bands broaden or move closer together? You misunderstand. The band gap is not a physical thing that shrinks or enlarges, or moves closer or further away from each other when given the right conditions.  The band gap merely refers to the amount of potential energy (in units of eV, electron volts) that is required for the electrons to cross the channel of a semiconductor. There is no physical distance between the valence band and the conduction band (other than the channel itself).  Now to the topic of increasing the temperature. When a higher-than-usual temperature is introduced, what happens is that some of the electrons gain enough energy to cross the gap.  In other words, the heat alters the conductivity of semiconductors by introducing extra energy, making it much easier for electrons to cross the band gap, and thus conducting current.  Above is a the Fermi function, which gives the probability of the energy state an available electron will be at at a given temperature.  If you want like to know more about Band Theory, I wrote another answer about it here: Explain qualitatively how the conduction properties of semiconductors could be changed by n type and p type doping?

            "answer_text": "Any physical quantity which effects the inter-atomic spacing of semiconductors result in a change in band gap of semiconductors. Temperature and stress are such physical quantities, which effect the inter-atomic spacing (lattice parameter). As we keep on increase the temperature of a given semiconductor, the inter-atomic spacing increases due to the increased amplitude of lattice vibrations. Consequently, the average lattice potential seen by the electron in the semiconductor decreases and hence a reduction in band gap. The change in inter-atomic spacing due to temperature is quantified by linear expansion coefficient of the corresponding material. The temperature dependence of energy band gap can be expressed as [math]E_{g}(T) = E_{g}(o) - \\dfrac{\\alpha T^{2}}{T + \\beta}[/math] Where, [math]\\alpha[/math] and [math]\\beta[/math] are fitting parameters The change in inter-atomic spacing effects the position of band edges on the energy scale. The above expression may not be valid for all the semiconductors. The exact band description (band width and shape) can be obtained by solving the Schrodinger\u2019s wave equation, at least for valence bands. The following figure illustrates the variation in energy gap as a function of inter-atomic separation for diamond crystal  You can clearly see the effect of change in inter-atomic spacing on band gap. As the inter-atomic spacing increases, we move towards the discrete energy levels correspond to isolated atoms. In addition to all, the curvature of band edges are also effected when the temperature of semiconductor changes. ",
