            "answer_text": "The Quora Platform does not have a direct text formatting features. Hence, I am unable to grasp the formula correctly. Is it neutral Oxygen molecule (O2(subsript))?; Then it is paramagnetic by 2 electrons per molecule with a bond order of 2 Is it dioxygen anion (O2(subscript)-(minus) (superscript))?: The it is also paramagnetic by 1 electron per anion species with a bond order of 1.5 Is it Oxide anion (O(2-) (Superscript)?: Then it is diamagnetiic with all 10 electrons paired as 1s(2)2s(2)2px(2)2py(2)2pz(2) Prof. A.

            "answer_text": "I take it, you are referring to the superoxide anion. In this case, it is like you are adding an extra electron to the O\u2082 molecule. If such a molecule has 12 electrons (6 per each O atom), the superoxide anion will have 13 electrons. Now, on to the magnetism of the superoxide. O\u2082 is known as a paramagnetic molecule in that, for instance, it sticks to the poles of a magnet when liquid. What about a molecule with just one more electron? A diagram of the molecular orbitals can help:  There is still one unpaired electron on one \u03c0* orbital. This means that the superoxide anion is paramagnetic. ",
