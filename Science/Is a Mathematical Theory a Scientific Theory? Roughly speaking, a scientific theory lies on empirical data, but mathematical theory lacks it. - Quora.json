            "answer_text": "A mathematical \"theory\" as you call it, is an axiomatic structure. It is developed by using the laws of ligical deduction (however those are conceived - there are traditional Boolean ones and others). One way to think of a system of logic is as a theorem factory. Known theorems in, new theorems out. However, most mathematicians I suspect rely on a combination of intuition abd serendipity to hypothesise what the new theorems may look like, in order to guide the manufacturing process (that is, the proofs).  As you observe, it need not have any connection with the real world - although in practice there are usually smart people who discover ways to use it to model aspects of nature. Scientific theories make predictions about nature, and are therefore in fact falsifiable hypotheses. Mathematical \"theories\" can be undermined if an error is found in an essential proof of a vital proposition. They can be falsified if they are discovered to generate an internal contradiction: that is, if their axioms turn out to be mutually incompatible. Individual theorems can be falsified if they contradict well-established results in the same theory and their proofs are found to be flawed. ",
