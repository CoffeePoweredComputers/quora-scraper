Now if we have to bring anything into this, it gets super technical. ANY thing really can be nothing or everything, or nothing and everything. Everything includes us, so we are nothing, but if we are also nothing than we are everything. If anything can be everything, and everything can be anything, than anything is nothing. This all comes back around to show that we are everything, nothing, and overall anything. No thing is every thing and every thing is any thing which is all no thing. This makes us all of them but at the same time, none of them. Yes. And no. :) ",
