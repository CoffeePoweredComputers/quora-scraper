            "answer_text": "It depends that on which field of science you want to make your project on. Whether it is biology or environment or physics or chemistry. Then you decide that what should be your project. For example if you want to make an water purifier then do thorough research from as many sources you can get your hands on. Then plan your project and work accordingly. You can even take help from others. If you do Facebook then you can join groups where you can ask your queries. Work as you planned and your project will be ready. ",
