            "answer_text": "This phenomenon is due to crystal field splitting It occurs in tetrahedral and octahedral complex due to , degenerate state..  In free metal ion , all five orbitals having same energy that is called degenerate state.  The degenerate state is maintained by metal atom , when ligands are surrounded in spherical field of ligands. Due to repulsions between electrons present in metal and ligands , the five d orbitals are splitting into two different sets . This is called crystal field splitting\u2026 S and P orbitals has are close to nucleus than d orbitals so they can't splits\u2026. There is more attractive force on the orbitalsHope it helps you\u2026 Thanks and regards : -Chaitanya ",

            "answer_text": " Your question is creative one.I also had this question when I was studying Coordination Chemistry,So I tried to draw distribution of atomic orbitals and verified by two teacher(one from Delhi University,Other from Jadavpur University) So You can see that d orbitals are more exposed to out side ligand orbitals whenever they are approaching central metal atom. Now,when ligand orbitals are appraoching angularly towards d orbitals of metal ion,d orbitals face attraction first and when they come too close to d orbitals,repulsion takes place.That\u2019s why d orbitals(for Oh and Th complexes,different d orbital sets are affected) get splitted but not inner core seated s or p orbitals. I would refer to have a look in Inorganic chemistry of Heheey,Keiter,Keitter. I hope I am clear from my point of view. ",
