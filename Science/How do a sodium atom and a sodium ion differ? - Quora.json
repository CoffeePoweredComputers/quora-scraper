            "answer_text": "You have been told the difference in the actual particle in other answers. So I will concentrate on the difference in chemical behaviour of sodium metal which is unionised and compounds that contain sodium ions. Sodium metal is an alkali metal. This group of metals in the first column of the Periodic Table, are the most reactive group of metals. Some metals will react with acids either slowly or fairly rapidly to form hydrogen gas and some heat. Sodium and the other alkali metals are so reactive that they will react with water to produce hydrogen gas and a lot of heat. Soon, the heat and the hydrogen gas which mixes with air containing oxygen, explodes. Sodium forms ions very easily and this is why it is so reactive, to be the point of being dangerous. It is highly controlled and must be stored under kerosene, to prevent contact with any dampness or moisture. Sodium ions are sodium atoms that have lost one of their electrons, the outermost one. They do this by reacting with something, and giving that other thing an electron. So sodium ions in the solid state are always in a compound. Sodium ions can also be present in aqueous solution, along with negative ions. Here they are separate, and hydrated or surround by a small cluster of water molecules. Sodium ions are very unreactive. They are quite soluble, and so do not form insoluble salts as precipitates with any negative ions. They cannot be electrolysed from aqueous solution to be plated onto an electrode like most other metals. In fact, to obtain sodium metal as a pure substance, sodium chloride must be in a molten state at very high temperature and a high voltage used to elctrolyse it and plate it onto an electrode. You typically ingest sodium ions every day, as they are naturally present in small quantities in many foods. Sodium chloride, or salt, which contains sodium ions, is frequently added to lots of foods you eat. You need sodium ions in your body, as they aid in the transmission of signals in neurons or nerve cells. Very low sodium levels, or too few ions, is dangerous for health. It is called hyponatremia. Literally \u2018low sodium\u2019. Hyponatremia and its cousin hypokalemia, or low potassium, can kill you. So chemically and biologically, sodium atoms and sodium ions are very different. Refer also to a previous answer which is more about the dietary requirements. Teresa Gemellaro's answer to I have a sodium deficiency. Should I eat some pure sodium? I think that normal salt doesn\u2019t have high enough of sodium concentration. ",

Sodium ion: IT HAS GIVEN 1 ELECTRON TO AN A NON-METAL ANION. It now has 11 protons with only 10 electrons, therefore making it positively charged because of the higher amount of protons to electrons. The single electron in its outermost orbital makes it extremely reactive. Basically, a sodium ion is just a sodium atom that has lost the electron in its outermost orbital.  ",
