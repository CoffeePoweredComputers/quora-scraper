            "answer_text": "people sure want you to think so. but their not. people are however great noticers of differences in all things, not just people. but people are probably the most widely noticed. ive studied race and identity in a class in college.i disagree with much of what was presented because it was presented as \u201cwhitemen are the cause of all the worlds problems\u201d kind of bias. in addition to being wired to notice differences. we are wired to notice patterns of behavior. when bad things happen we try to make sense of them, and its easy to see how people could associate things with certain peoples based on a limited sample. but overall humans have a mistrust of what i call \u201coutsiders\u201d: people different than a main group. This idea can be proven by looking at natural populations of animals. take chimps for example: they war with \u201coutsiders\u201d because they mean to take resources from them. the first law of economics is that there is never enough to go around. outsiders have to realize that they are outsiders and do everything in their power to convince the main group that they deserve to be considered part of the main group. this is on an individual level, not on a group level\u2026despite current politics and ridiculous identity sciences. the individual must become part of the whole in the best most efficient way possible or the main group will not trust the outsider. our current society thinks that all people ought to be smart enough to understand that my theory above is crap and that people are supposed to just accept everyone and everything as is. this is just not how nature works. this is not how trust works, by blind faith in people. once bitten twice shy. of course the politicians and race baiters will never allow anyone to believe my theory because they would lose control over people. the real way to become one people is to accept the idea that you cannot go against the grain and make friends. you go a tiny bit, as much as the main group allows but thats it. when my great grandparents came from italy they told my dad \u201cto speak english because we are american now. italy had nothing for us\u201d they adopted american celebrations and customs and were happy. sure no one wants to lose what they know, but ask yourself why you came here or moved to this neighborhood for. was it to force everyone to accept you or to be more like them? because no one is going to let you change them as a group. youll be run out of town.

            "answer_text": "Anyone can be a racist, or not.  Anyone can have 'bad' thoughts, or not.  And anyone can do 'bad' things, or not.   So if we don't like the 'bad' things, we can always find love, which is a good thing.  And anyone can have 'love', or not.   So we are all both bad, and good.  And we can all learn to focus on the good parts.   Like when I am the subject of a racist remark, or racial discrimination, I tend not to be offended at all.  In fact the experience makes me smile inside.  Because I love them.  And that is what matters to me.  I am glad they are there and a part of my life experience.  You know, but if they are chasing me or trying to hurt me, I'm not just goin' to stand there like an idiot;  I will protect myself.  But it will be of necessity and out of love, much like the necessity for me to kill an animal or plant in order for me to survive.  I do it with respect for life. So when I see 'racism' in the world, all I see are other humans; some whom have chosen to put more energy in racist activities, and others who choose to be either bothered by it or not.   Not being bothered by racism, I think, allows one to put more focus on making positive changes in the areas where people ought to get along better.  Not being 'bothered' by something does not mean you don't care, but rather it means you care more, for both parties.  Being 'bothered' puts more weight on one side.   Of course, putting a group of 'bothered' people together to combat another group is also a form of 'balancing' and justification for adding 'weight'.  That's probably why we have wars, to balance things out.  I'm trying to say that being 'bothered' by something is fine too.   So bottom line is that we are all basically nice people (because we are all part of the same love) who sometimes may not seem too nice, depending on who's shoes we happen to be standing in. ",

            "answer_text": "Everybody is not inherently racist. That\u2019s the same ignorant and simple thinking that leads to being racist in the first place. There are 7 billion people on this rock. And to have the arrogance to speak for all 7 billion about racism is quite telling. We know for a fact you probably couldn\u2019t name a specific characteristic for all 196 countries, but you think you can tell something about all 7 billion people. You must be like Professor Charles Xavier from the X-Men. Now me personally, as a black man in America, grew up with white family my entire life. That\u2019s right. White people loved me before I found out that there were white people that hated me just for being black so I was easily able to differentiate. I\u2019ve never been racist. I\u2019ve always judged everybody as individuals. Considering that there are actually biracial people, the ideology of everybody being racist should immediately explode from your head. One of my favorite cousin\u2019s is biracial. Just because you\u2019re racist, don\u2019t try to justify it by painting your weakness on the whole world. If you choose to ignore that racism is strictly a social concept and has no truth in biology, that\u2019s your ignorance shining and I\u2019d appreciate it if you keep it to yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe so, but I do believe that society tends to shape us to be that way. I\u2019m a Muslim and when I was growing up my family always told me to be careful of x because \u201cx people were dangerous.\u201d Nowadays, whenever I see a x person I don\u2019t feel slightly on edge or uncomfortable because my parents and grandparents always were uncomfortable around them and I didn\u2019t want to behave like my parents or grandparents. It\u2019s up to new generations to stop any racism that is being passed down the bloodlines, because it is evident. I don\u2019t look like the stereotypical Muslim so when people realize I am, some don\u2019t change, but some act different. For example, in history class the teacher asked a question about Muslims and I answered and when the teacher asked how I knew, I said it was because I was a Muslim. The teacher kind of looked surprised and acted normal, but some kid at my table stiffened and began looking at me differently ever since. Often times, it seems to be that certain ethnicities that experience racism towards themselved, don\u2019t reciprocate the behavior because they know how it hurts and it\u2019s a behavior that can be controlled. Now please remember that all this is my opinion and experience, so it might be different for you or someone else. TL/DR: No. ",

I'm a white New Yorker. I feel more comfortable around black New Yorkers than white rural people. That's still tribalism. It just happens not to be based on skin color. ",

Very few of us humans are brought up to love and embrace without fear or suspicion of another - whatever that may be. Very few of us can be accepting of things that we are conditioned to recognize as \"not so good\". It is easy to be kind and loving when we are in environments where there is no threat to any of our belief systems.  Take people out of this comfort zone and you will see their real natures coming out. For example, I know people who are into meditation and yoga and healthy living and that sort of thing, and choose to insulate themselves from the outside world as they see it.  Meet them in their domain and they will be the nicest, kindest, most wonderful, smiling people.  Put some of them in a bus in downtown Los Angeles, and you can see them being repulsed! To me, a cool person is who can be comfortable flying a private plane, sharing a sandwich and a conversation with a homeless person, be generous and grin even when all is lost!  Very few parents know how to raise a kid to become something like this. ",

This can lead to discrimination in the workplace and during interviews and even when selecting a marriage partner. This may also have law enforcement consequences, with reports that black and Indian youth are more likely to be mistrusted and arrested for crimes than white people. Therefore, it is obviously a dangerous bias to carry. It was useful at one time but no longer is. We should not let some antisocial elements use this to increase the divide. We can and should work to reduce differences and racism. ",

All of this creates a comfort zone. When a person sees someone who looks different and acts differently, it may create discomfort. That, in and of itself, isn't racism. Racism is when someone treats someone else differently because of race. People may do this without even realizing it.
