            "answer_text": "That's actually a great question. Typical oxygen molecules consist of two oxygen atoms bonded together. Larger molecules will tend to stick and tangle together into big clumps (which is true of most organic materials), but oxygen molecules are too small to get entangled. Molecules that are asymmetrical tend to become polar, meaning that they'll develop a positive charge on one side and a negative charge on the other. Water's a perfect example of this. When that happens, the molecules will stick together, negative side to positive side, kind of like a bucket of magnets. But oxygen molecules are symmetrical, which means that have almost no polarity. So, fundamentally, small, simple, non-polar molecules have very little reason to stick together, they just bounce off each other. Basically every molecule that fits that description will be a gas at room temperature. The only way to liquefy molecules like that is to get them so cold that their movement slows to a crawl, and they have so little energy left that even their tiny polarization is enough to hold them together.

            "answer_text": "All molecules have attractions between each other that result in an energy of liquefaction or vaporization. This attractive energy is a result of electrons in one molecule attracting nuclei in another molecule from distortions of the electron clouds in collisions and is low for molecules with nonpolar bonds. Nonpolar bonds are bonds between identical or very similar in electron structure atoms. O2 molecules are nonpolar therefore intermolecular energy of liquefaction is low. The second property all molecules have is a molecular velocity distribution this results in the molecules having a distribution of kinetic energies. At a given temperature some molecules have enough energy to escape from the liquid as the temperature is raised more and more can escape until above the critical temperature a gas cannot be liquefied. The critical temperature of O2 is well below room temperature[-118C]. ",
