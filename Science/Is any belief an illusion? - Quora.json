            "answer_text": "All beliefs exist, or make sense, in an appropriate, restricted, defined, contextual domain. It is what Jacques Derrida spelled as: \u201cThere are no Meta-Narratives\u201d. So outside its claimed domain of significance, all beliefs could be said to be illusory, or more properly, meaningless. But inside an specific associated context domain they would be real. So the answer to your question would be both yes and no. But in the context of your life certain beliefs will work for a long time in such a way that, for you, they will represent eternal truth. In a way, they are. But this can be challenged in a crisis, in extreme situational stress, that may force you to reevaluate what your context really is, and force you to recognize new ways of thinking, new values, new expectations. In such a situation your beliefs will have to be adjusted. ",
