            "answer_text": "Because the hydrogen is DIRECTLY bound to oxygen, a STRONGLY electronegative element. And when involved in a covalent bond, electronegative elements POLARIZE electron density towards themselves. And for water we could represent the interaction as \u2026 [math]H-O-\\stackrel{\\delta+}H\\cdots\\stackrel{\\delta-}OH_{2}\\cdots\\stackrel{\\delta-}OH_{2}[/math] We note that this interaction is INTERMOLECULAR, i.e. BETWEEN individual water molecules. Hydrogen bonding also occurs in hydrogen fluoride, [math]HF[/math], and ammonia, [math]NH_{3}[/math], and the boiling points of BOTH these hydrides are elevated\u2026 The boiling points of alcohols is also elevated by reason of [math]\\text{H-bonding}[/math]\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "H bonding is strongest when the H atom is bonded to highly electronegative elements like F, O, and N, although there can be weak H bonds when lesser electronegative elements are involved. So the highly electronegative element will draw a higher percentage of electron density towards itself, leaving less electron density around the proton of the H nucleus, resulting in the strong partial positive charge of the H atom.
