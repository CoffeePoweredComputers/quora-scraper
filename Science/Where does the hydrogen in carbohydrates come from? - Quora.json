            "answer_text": "Water, it comes from water H2O, 2 hydrogen for every oxygen atom, plenty of it in water, plants get some extra oxygen from the air through photosynthesis. Not by taking the virtual nonexistent hydrogen in the atmosphere, which due to the fact that it\u2019s less dense than air would be(this is one part where your hypothesis is correct) in the upper atmosphere and unable to be used by plants or insects or even be burned in a fire. So oddly enough they use the large source of hydrogen that is available and is needed by plants, rather than a fictional supply. ",
