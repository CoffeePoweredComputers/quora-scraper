            "answer_text": "The same way as with objects which sink in water. For both kinds of objects you have to find their mass by weighing usually. To find the volume of a floating object, take a large enough container filled up to the brim with water and press the object down into water so that it just immerses completely, taking care that you do not immerse any other implement like your hand. Measure the volume of water spilled out by any means like a measuring cylinder. This will give you the volume of the object by Archimedes principle. Divide the mass by the volume to get the density.

            "answer_text": "Without more information, the only answer is: less than one gram per cubic centimetre as that is the density of water and an object has to be less dense than water to float. Now that may seem wrong when you consider iron ships float and iron is denser than water but the proper definition of why something floats is: it must displace a volume of water equal or greater than its own weight This is why iron ships can float, most of their volume is air reducing the net density.
