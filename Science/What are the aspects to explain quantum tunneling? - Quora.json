            "answer_text": "Suppose we have a potential barrier of height \u201cV\u201d and the energy of the incident particle is \u201cE\u201d. Now, two situations may arise:- 1. Incident particle has energy greater than the height of the barrier i.e., E > V. 2. Incident particle has energy less than the height of the barrier i.e., E < V. Classically, particle has sufficient energy to cross the barrier in 1st case, so whole of the energy gets transmitted through the barrier, while in 2nd case it would not be possible for the particle to cross the barrier, it would be completed reflected. However, quantum mechanically there is a finite probability of finding the particle even in E < V, this is called quantum tunneling. It is attributed to the fact that particles are described by waves in Quantum mechanics, and in E < V incident particles would also transmit in the barrier region due to their wave nature and their probability decays exponentially.
