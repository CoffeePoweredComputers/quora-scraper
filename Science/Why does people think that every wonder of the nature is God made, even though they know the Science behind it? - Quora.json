            "answer_text": "As you said Before they know the science of it People who think that wonders of nature are god made, are the people who believe that god exists and created everything including nature and its wonders and at some point its laws too. Nature is never lack of wonders in it to inspire, motivate, or even scare people. One who believes god also believes that god made these wonderful things or that things made by god (nature) are no less than wonderful, nevertheless. So, he praises god for his power and ability to make such wonders in nature for us. After they knew the science of it Yeah, some things(just few!!) are less scary, less inspirational, if we knew the science or laws that control it. But it doesn't change the belief of, god made such wonders and he is capable of doing those. Just a human nature played in the story of wonders becoming less scary or less motivational in some cases. As i must say being amazed by nature is itself a part of human nature and we really don't know what is a wonder and what is not. I mean , we didn't know where the wonder exists in nature and probably we have seen a glimpse of it or misunderstood something else for wonder of our innocence. Apart from this fluctuations, nature in one or the other way amazed, scared, inspired mankind with its nature, irrespective of the little or lot we know about it. So one who believed a wonderful nature was a god made, continues to believe it, whether he knows the science of it or not.( because he believes so) And also science is not contradicting god i.e. Not saying that \" i know how it's done , so you just back-off and don't tell that you did this\". If we actually know what science is and what the concept of god is, it is obvious that they are not contradicting each other, as they are. Then it is obvious to have an answer to these sort of questions. Thank you for the question!!! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi! Thanks for the A2A. This is an interesting question. I will need a brief prologue before actually addressing it. It is quite possible to marvel at something even if you know (or could find out) how it is made. The Taj Mahal, the palace at Versailles, the temples at Angkor Wat, the pyramids at Giza: these are all considered to be wonders. They are not less wonderful because we know how they were made: basically dressed stone laid on stone bound by mortar. If an artist shows you a painting which is so beautiful it brings tears to your eyes, you would not let your knowledge of dyes, pigments and application methods get in the way of your appreciation of his art. The fact that he used well known methods with standard equipment is secondary. The important thing is what the artist is trying to communicate. It is the same with God. The brilliant sunset that brought tears to your eyes is not just the result of a complex interplay of solar radiation with kinetically trapped aqueous aerosols. That is simply what the rainbow is made of . The rainbow is actually God\u2019s expression of love to His creation*. The other great and little natural wonders can be interpreted in the same way**. * This is literally true. After the flood in the story of Noah\u2019s ark (Book of Genesis in the Bible) God made the rainbow a sign of His covenant with Noah and his descendants. It is a symbol of a war-bow, but it is pointed upwards. God has taken into himself the arrows of destruction meant for us. **Of course, here the analogy with the artist ends. The human artist creates art with whatever is already present. God creates His wonders with materials which also He created. ",
