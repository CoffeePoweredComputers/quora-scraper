            "answer_text": " The oxygen cycle is the biogiochemical cycle of oxygen within its four main reservoirs: The atmosphere (air), the total content of biological matter within the Biosphere(the global sum of all ecosystems), the Hydrosphere(the combined mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of planet Earth), and the Lithosphere (also called as Earth's crust). The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is Photosynthesis (where green plants absorb CO2 present in atmosphere to prepare the food and liberating oxygen into atmosphere), which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmosphere and life on Earth. The presence of atmospheric oxygen has led to the formation of Ozone (O3)and the Ozone layer within the stratosphere which prevents harmful radiation (UV rays) entering Earth's atmosphere which causes lot of damage . To Summarise: The process by which oxygen released into the atmosphere by photosynthetic organisms is taken up by aerobic organisms while the carbon dioxide released as a by-product of repiration is taken up by plant's for photosynthesis.
