            "answer_text": "Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, it can only be converted. This statement is completely wrong (reads: outdated). Quantum fluctuation of vacuum can create as well as destroy energy. Plus, when time translational symmetry (meaning, laws of physics are same for both before and after a certain point of time) breaks, energy conservation law breaks. And, during certain situations like complex spacetime geometry, energy even stops being defined. ",

            "answer_text": "Our universe was handed what until recently we thought was our universe's constant total energy as we budded off from possibly eternal inflation. Then around 20 years ago we discovered our universe\u2019s expansion seems to have started accelerating about 4 billion years ago. We currently explain this as the effect of a uniform energy density we\u2019re calling dark energy. 4 billion years ago the growing dark energy overmatched gravitational attraction causing the acceleration. If this explanation holds, our universe will eventually inflate exponentially in its end times. Maybe our universe\u2019s final exponential inflation will start budding off our own daughter universes. Just a thought. ",
