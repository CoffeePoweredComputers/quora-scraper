            "answer_text": "By way of my qualifications for what follows, I spent thirteen months at the geographic South Pole in charge of the National Science Foundation\u2019s atmospheric research. Let\u2019s look at the Ozone Layer. On my website, I have a section titled \u201cThe Great Ozone Hole Hoax.\u201d Basically, it is a short slide presentation with 9 slides. Here are the 9 annotated slides:   Ozone consists of 3 oxygen atoms. It is created when an oxygen molecule combines with a free oxygen atom.  Ultraviolet light from the sun breaks apart oxygen molecules into 2 oxygen atoms. These atoms either recombine into an oxygen molecule, or they combine with an oxygen molecule to form an ozone molecule. It turns out that upper atmosphere ozone is the RESULT of upper-level oxygen-absorbing ultraviolet and thus protecting the Earth\u2019s surface.  Any oxygen-containing atmosphere on any planet will have an ozone layer because of the action of ultraviolet on the oxygen molecules. The resulting ozone layer also adds protection from ultraviolet, BUT the layer itself is the product of the protection provided by the oxygen in the atmosphere.  Ozone decays naturally and from ultraviolet and some chemicals. When it decays, the individual oxygen molecules recombine into either oxygen molecules or ozone molecules.  Because the Earth is tilted in its orbit, in the summer the Poles are exposed to the sun. In the winter the Poles do not see the Sun. Consequently, ozone is generated when the Poles are exposed to the Sun.  At both poles, there are 3 months of sunlight, 3 months of twilight, 3 months of darkness, and 3 months of twilight \u2014 for a total of 3 months where ozone is generated, and because ozone decays naturally, 9 months where ozone disappears. Consequently, there always has been a thinning (a \u201chole\u201d) in the ozone layer at both Poles, and there always will.   Hopefully, this short discussion of what the ozone layer is really all about, and what the \u201chole\u201d is and what it isn\u2019t will help you understand the issue better. ",

            "answer_text": "The Ozone layer is not depleting; this was a Hoax started in the 1980\u2019s, based on a few years of anomalous measurements. For various reasons, the Hoax took on a life of its own, and refuses to die. Measurement graphs clearly show no significant changes since about 1985. Ozone is created and destroyed by large-scale reactions among atmospheric Oxygen, UV in sunlight, and natural and artificial chemicals drifting around in the Stratosphere. The cost of generating Ozone and transporting it to the Stratosphere, is too great to consider seriously. ",
