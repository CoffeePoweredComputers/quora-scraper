            "answer_text": "What are the rarest types of stars we have observed in space? This is not an easy question to answer, mostly because we often are not certain exactly what we are observing, but also because we know there are vast regions we can\u2019t observe. A stellar object can change it\u2019s nature many times through the course of its life. Current theories predict some things we have not seen, and cannot explain all of the things we have seen.  Eta Carinae is a stellar object that has fascinated astronomers since its discovery in 1846, and despite extensive study, we still aren\u2019t certain of its exact nature.[1] Generally, the most massive stars are also the most rare. Neutron stars are remnants of the supernova explosions of very massive stars, and while very small (30 km in diameter), they are massive and unbelievably dense (10^17 kg*m^-3).[2] In earth gravity, a teaspoonful of neutron star would weigh 10 million tons.[3] Since neutron stars are the result of only a fraction of all supernova, these are more rare than the largest main sequence stars. I was ready to suggest the magnetar as the rarest type of star. A magnetar[4] is probably a neutron star (a.k.a pulsar[5] ) with an anomalously strong magnetic field. Fewer than 50 magnetars have been detected so far. Binary (paired) neutron stars are also rare. A couple of likely mergers of these pairs[6] have been observed, and found to produce the elements gold, platinum and uranium in large quantities.[7] We really have no idea how many of these objects are out there. After a quick search on the web for other rare types of stars. I found a relevant article published a year ago. What's Going On With The Rarest Stars In The Universe? But then there are the weirdos. There are the supermassive stars that collapse directly to black holes, with no supernovae. There are the stars that get so hot that they start spontaneously producing electron/positron pairs on the inside, leading to a special kind of supernova. There are stars that should have a collapsed object at the center of a still-alive giant star, known as a Thorne-Zytkow[8] object. There are stars, young-and-old, that exhibit extremely rare flaring behavior, like Herbig-Haro objects or Wolf-Rayet stars. And, yet unconfirmed, there are stars made completely from pristine clouds of gas, composed solely of hydrogen and helium: the first stars in the Universe. Stars from this era may reach as much as 1,000 solar masses, and will hopefully be revealed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which was built \u2014 in part \u2014 to decipher the Universes secrets from exactly this early stage. Whether these primordial objects ever existed, or now exist as anything more than a space-time echo of their former selves, is an open question.

Article text excerpts When we look out at the Universe with our most powerful telescopes, we often think about distant galaxies at the astrophysical limits of what we can perceive. In each one, on average, are hundreds of billions of stars, each with their own one-of-a-kind history. But if we want to learn about what stars are out there, we have to look close by. Only in our own relatively nearby cosmic backyard, in the Milky Way and other galaxies no more than a few million light years away, can we resolve individual stars in detail. Thanks to tremendous surveys like Hipparcos, Pan-STARRS and the ongoing Gaia mission, we\u2019ve been able to measure and categorize literally millions upon millions of stars. When we look at what we find, there are a few general things that most of them have in common. And then, beyond those, there are the outliers. \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 . Normally, we break stars like this up into seven different classes, with M-class being the smallest, lowest-mass, reddest and coolest, and O-class being the largest, most-massive, bluest and hottest stars.  \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 . Individual stars would grow as large as possible from the molecular clouds they formed from, cooling from their elements, heating up from gravitational collapse, growing until radiation pressure from the internal processes like fusion created an upper limit. Then: The lowest-mass M-class stars, up until about 40% of the Sun\u2019s mass, would burn hydrogen into helium slowly, eventually dying by contracting into a helium white dwarf.Mid-range K-class through B-class stars, from about 40% to 800% of the Sun\u2019s mass, burn hydrogen into helium, then heat up to fuse helium into carbon, becoming a red giant, and finally dying in a planetary nebula accompanied by a carbon/oxygen white dwarf.And the highest-mass stars, including the heaviest B-class and the O-class stars, will go beyond helium fusion into stages like carbon burning, oxygen burning, and all the way to silicon burning, leading to a supernova with either a neutron star or black hole at their cores.This, at least, is our typical picture of stellar evolution. But then there are the weirdos. There are the supermassive stars that collapse directly to black holes, with no supernovae. There are the stars that get so hot that they start spontaneously producing electron/positron pairs on the inside, leading to a special kind of supernova.  There are binary stars that steal mass off of one of the members, sometimes siphoning off all the massive hydrogen from a giant star.
