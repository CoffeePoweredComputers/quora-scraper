            "answer_text": "\u201cIf energy can neither be created nor destroyed, does that mean that the amount of energy available since the beginning of time is the same till now?\u201d The word \u201cavailable\u201d is key in your question! When work is done the amount of available energy goes down and the amount of waste heat goes up. This waste heat is called entropy. The amount of energy as entropy always goes up in total and that reduces the total amount of available energy. People like to give examples of local decreases in entropy. Life in particular has lower entropy than its surroundings. What always happens is the total entropy in the universe goes up. Increasing the amount of living matter releases plenty of waste heat. Even maintaining the same amount of living matter releases plenty of waste heat. In these two examples we call that eating calories in food. The calories eventually get released as waste heat. There\u2019s also a giant scale issue. Our \u201cuniverse\u201d is only the part inside of our observable horizon. As the entire universe expands the distance to our observable horizon stays the same. Stuff moves out of \u201cour\u201d universe even though it stays in the same \u201ctotal\u201d universe. That\u2019s another version of the word \u201cavailable\u201d on a different scale. The matter and energy is not destroyed but we can never again observe it. It\u2019s no longer \u201cavailable\u201d to us. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is \u2018Yes\u2019. The Universe is eternal. That means it didn\u2019t come from anywhere. This also means that its \u2018material\u2019 self must be fully complete. Its activity is endless and functions perfectly. Its makeup of materials all behave interchangeably and having completed some function are recycled, endlessly. Time is not a dimension and exists only in human imagination. Like so much else - the Big Bang stars only in our heads. ",
