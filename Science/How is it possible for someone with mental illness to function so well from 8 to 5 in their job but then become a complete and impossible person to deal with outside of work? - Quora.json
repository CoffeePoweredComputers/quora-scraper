            "answer_text": "It is possible in the same way that kids with ADHD can maintain at school for 8 hours and then when they get home, behavior totally changes. Part of it is that it is stressful to have to keep yourself kind of reined in for a long period of time. People maintain at work, but by the end of the day it is emotionally exhausting and they are done. It is easier to let it all go at home, where the stakes aren\u2019t theoretically as high. The other part of it is that we by nature tend to treat those closest to us worse under certain circumstances than we do friends or coworkers. It isn\u2019t uncommon for our significant others, kids, parents, roommates, etc. to catch the brunt of our worst behavior, so part of it is just typical human nature kicking in. Another reason for it is that close relationships tend to set off certain dynamics, feelings and responses that other relationships and interactions do not. When you put all of these factors together it is almost a given with someone dealing with mental illness that things are going to go a little differently at home than they do at work. ",

            "answer_text": "Routine can be very helpful to people with mental illness. There\u2019s often a lot of structure at work, and that can make it possible for people to cope at work, whereas they have great difficulty with unstructured environments, especially when those environments are very stressful. Often times, unstructured relationships, such as those with family members, can be constant sources of stress and pain, leading to arguments and disagreements and fear and pain that is not visible to those who are not considered \u201cmentally ill.\u201d Family life was hard for me when I was first diagnosed. But it turned out that family life was what made me sick. I was living in constant fear that my wife would leave me. This severely disabled me. At work, I could do some things \u2014 enough to stay employed for five more years, but eventually I wasn\u2019t even doing enough work to stay employed. They let me go. Closed my department so they didn\u2019t actually have to let me go (I was the only one in the department). I haven\u2019t worked for others since. But it looked like I was doing something at work to a lot of people. I was only doing 10 percent of what I used to do. Someone eventually caught on, and that\u2019s when my department was closed. Maybe if I\u2019d told them I was bipolar, I could have saved my employment, but then again, who knows? It didn\u2019t happen. So don\u2019t be fooled. A person may appear to be working, and my not be doing much. A person may appear to be mentally ill at home, but may have very good reasons for being in pain that simply aren\u2019t visible to those who can\u2019t see inside their heads \u2014 which is most people. Often, the source of the pain isn\u2019t visible to the ill person, either. It took me years to figure out that my marriage had been in trouble for two decades before my wife left me. It was in trouble for a decade before I got diagnosed. I was in total denial of the problems all that time because I was too afraid of losing my wife. In the end, the fear of losing her that I could not admit to myself was what caused me to lose her. Such is life. ",
