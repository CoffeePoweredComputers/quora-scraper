            "answer_text": "The vol measure used in hydrogen peroxide refers to the volume of oxygen that it produces per volume of hydrogen peroxide used up at room temperature.  So, if you consider the equation:  2H2O2 --> 2H2O + O2  You can see that 2 moles of hydrogen peroxide produces 1 mole of oxygen, i.e. the number of moles of oxygen produced is half that of hydrogen peroxide used up.  If your hydrogen peroxide solution is 100 vol (quite reasonable for a strong stock solution) this means that 1000 cm3 of the H2O2 produces 100,000 cm3 of oxygen. ",

            "answer_text": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is water (H2O) with an \u201cextra\u201d oxygen atom. Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide yields water and oxygen gas. The term volume refers to the amount of oxygen gas that is released. One ounce of 100 volume peroxide will release 100 ounces of oxygen gas. The volume indicates the concentration of peroxide in the solution. 3% = 10 volume 6% = 20 volume 12% = 40 volume 30% = 100 volume 35% = 130 volume ",
