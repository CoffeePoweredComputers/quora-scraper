You can\u2019t have the same electron configuration with different numbers of electrons. However, if you allow ionization, then it is possible. For example, oxide ion, fluoride ion, neon, sodium ion, magnesium ion and aluminum ion all have the same ground-state electron configuration: 1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076. ",

Since isotope have same number of electrons, so they have same electronic configuration. All isoelectronic species have same electronic configuration. ",
