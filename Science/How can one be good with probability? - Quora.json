I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re at, but Grinstead and Snell\u2019s book Introduction to Probability is the best book I\u2019ve found on the subject. It\u2019s got plenty of practice problems for you to work through. And how lucky for you that there\u2019s a copy online: https://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf It has some statistics in it and so as a whole it is a good start. If you\u2019re less of a textbook learner, then I suggest you watch through videos on Khan Academy or sign up to Brilliant and start working through problems there. I also can not help but mention Mosteller\u2019s book Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions. You could work through each problem learning new concepts as you go. Good luck. ",

And ask statisticians to share with you on how they think (especially their critical thinking processes) in tackling situations or problems. I understand your question; and whilst I was a student (I do still think of myself as a student now and always); I would read the thick textbooks cover to cover, again and again until I felt and thought that I could understand and was able to comprehend what the fuck I was reading. I have to thank all my professors//lecturers for all the grueling hard times though; my professors used to produce questions that were harder than the standard SOA papers\u2014 just to mock us. :D but the questions (that made me cry in the examination halls because I felt so, so defeated\u2014 reading the textbooks again and again and practicing again and again and/or until I felt and thought I was ready for the exams but reading the questions in the examination hall just proved to me that I wasn\u2019t at all ready) prepared and improved me for applying and solving shit.
