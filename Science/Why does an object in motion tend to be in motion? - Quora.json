            "answer_text": "An object is in motion because there is nothing to stop it. It is as simple as that. The moment the object would collide with another object, its state i.e. its velocity will change. If you kick a football and there is no friction on the ground to slow it down or no air resistance to slow it down it, it will be in motion. That is the first law of motion. But that is not all. Motion is relative. When a body is not in motion in your frame of reference, it does not mean it is at absolute rest. Your house is not in motion in your frame of reference but your house is in motion because the house is on the surface of the earth and the earth is in motion. Everything is in motion, always. The universe itself is in motion. It is expanding. Everything is accelerating away from each other. Nothing can stay in a given position because the position keeps changing due to the expansion of the universe. A body can stay in a given position only in a given frame of reference and that too because the body and the frame of reference are moving in the same direction at the same speed. ",

            "answer_text": "Newton is your friend. An object in motion doesn\u2019t \u2018tend\u2019 to be in motion it just is. To make an object move you have to apply force to it to overcome both inertia, and the mass/weight of the object. Once that object is in motion it will continue along a straight path until and unless it is influenced by another force, like gravity or air resistance. If you apply a force to an object in space it will continue to move indefinitely, or until it hits another object, or is influenced by the gravity of another object.
