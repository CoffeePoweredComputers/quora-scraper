            "answer_text": "Looks like everyone here did pretty well so I'm going to chime in to give some hope to people who still want to go to med school in spite of how they did on Ochem. I got a C+ and a B- in my 2 semesters of Ochem. By far my worst grades in undergrad. I just couldn't convert one molecule to another for the life of me. Just didn't like the subject. But you know what, being bad at Ochem didn't affect me at all in med school. Probably used Ochem less than 2% of the time in med school. The only Chem class we had by then was Biochem which involved tons of memorization of pathways. In the last 15 years of what I would consider a very successful and fulfilling medical career I probably used Ochem less than 1% of the time. So there's hope for you future docs who did terrible on Ochem, just keep on plugging and rock your other science classes. Ochem is  just a small bump on the road of a long medical journey. ",

Then I took a graduate level biochem course and got an A. After I was pretty reasonably sure that I could cut the hard sciences required for medical school I shifted my studies to humanities degree. I switched my major to Spanish and traveled abroad and had fun the rest of my undergraduate time!  To this day I am convinced that that's what allowed me to gain entrance to a top 10 medical school from a state university. ",

Biochemistry worked the same and I did well in it also. Where I struggled was in the math involved in ordinary chemical reactions and had to work harder to get better grades. I was generally better in those subjects in which there were biological applications for chemistry. Probably, because I enjoyed biology a great deal. ",

Some instructors are more difficult than others. Your MCAT score is there to level the playing field. If you get an A, and your MCAT score is low, then the reviewers will see that you don't know your stuff. The opposite is also true. You should have at least a 3.5 GPA and a solid MCAT score. ",
