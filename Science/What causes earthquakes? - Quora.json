            "answer_text": "Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake. When two blocks of rock or two plates are rubbing against each other, they stick a little. When the rocks break, the earthquake occurs. The tectonic plates are always slowly moving, but they get stuck at their edges due to friction. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel. Read the following article: Source: usgs.gov  What is an earthquake? An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth\u2019s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can\u2019t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock!  A simplified cartoon of the crust (brown), mantle (orange), and core (liquid in light gray, solid in dark gray) of the earth. (Public domain.) What causes earthquakes and where do they happen? The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece \u2013 it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.  The tectonic plates divide the Earth's crust into distinct \"plates\" that are always slowly moving. Earthquakes are concentrated along these plate boundaries. (Public domain.) Why does the earth shake when there is an earthquake? While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth\u2019s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us! How are earthquakes recorded?  The cartoon sketch of the seismograph shows how the insrument shakes with the earth below it, but the recording device remains stationary (instead of the other way around). (Public domain.) Earthquakes are recorded by instruments called seismographs. The recording they make is called a seismogram. The seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement. The difference in position between the shaking part of the seismograph and the motionless part is what is recorded. How do scientists measure the size of earthquakes? The size of an earthquake depends on the size of the fault and the amount of slip on the fault, but that\u2019s not something scientists can simply measure with a measuring tape since faults are many kilometers deep beneath the earth\u2019s surface. So how do they measure an earthquake? They use the seismogram recordings made on the seismographs at the surface of the earth to determine how large the earthquake was (figure 5). A short wiggly line that doesn\u2019t wiggle very much means a small earthquake, and a long wiggly line that wiggles a lot means a large earthquake. The length of the wiggle depends on the size of the fault, and the size of the wiggle depends on the amount of slip. The size of the earthquake is called its magnitude. There is one magnitude for each earthquake. Scientists also talk about theintensity of shaking from an earthquake, and this varies depending on where you are during the earthquake.  An example of a seismic wave with the P wave and S wave labeled. (Public domain.) How can scientists tell where the earthquake happened? Seismograms come in handy for locating earthquakes too, and being able to see the P wave and the S wave is important. You learned how P & S waves each shake the ground in different ways as they travel through it. P waves are also faster than S waves, and this fact is what allows us to tell where an earthquake was. To understand how this works, let\u2019s compare P and S waves to lightning and thunder. Light travels faster than sound, so during a thunderstorm you will first see the lightning and then you will hear the thunder. If you are close to the lightning, the thunder will boom right after the lightning, but if you are far away from the lightning, you can count several seconds before you hear the thunder. The further you are from the storm, the longer it will take between the lightning and the thunder. P waves are like the lightning, and S waves are like the thunder. The P waves travel faster and shake the ground where you are first. Then the S waves follow and shake the ground also. If you are close to the earthquake, the P and S wave will come one right after the other, but if you are far away, there will be more time between the two.  P Waves alternately compress and stretch the crustal material parallel to the direction they are propagating. S Waves cause the crustal material to move back and forth perpendicular to the direction they are travelling. (Public domain.) By looking at the amount of time between the P and S wave on a seismogram recorded on a seismograph, scientists can tell how far away the earthquake was from that location. However, they can\u2019t tell in what direction from the seismograph the earthquake was, only how far away it was. If they draw a circle on a map around the station where the radius of the circle is the determined distance to the earthquake, they know the earthquake lies somewhere on the circle. But where? Scientists then use a method called triangulation to determine exactly where the earthquake was (see image below). It is called triangulation because a triangle has three sides, and it takes three seismographs to locate an earthquake. If you draw a circle on a map around three different seismographs where the radius of each is the distance from that station to the earthquake, the intersection of those three circles is the epicenter! Can scientists predict earthquakes? No, and it is unlikely they will ever be able to predict them. Scientists have tried many different ways of predicting earthquakes, but none have been successful. On any particular fault, scientists know there will be another earthquake sometime in the future, but they have no way of telling when it will happen. Is there such a thing as earthquake weather? Can some animals or people tell when an earthquake is about to hit? These are two questions that do not yet have definite answers. If weather does affect earthquake occurrence, or if some animals or people can tell when an earthquake is coming, we do not yet understand how it works.  Triangulation can be used to locate an earthquake. The seismometers are shown as green dots. The calculated distance from each seismometer to the earthquake is shown as a circle. The location where all the circles intersect is the location of the earthquake epicenter. \ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0d\ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf10\ud83c\udf10 Thank you for reading \ud83d\ude4f ",

            "answer_text": "The layer of the earth just below the crust is called the \"mantle\" - it is made of hot, molten rock. The closer you get to the earth's center (\"core\"), the hotter it gets, so the temperature of the molten rock in the mantle is not uniform - it's less hot near the surface (\"crust\") and more hot near the core. Because heat causes matter to expand, the hotter molten rock near the core is \"bigger\" - less dense, than the cooler rock near the crust. So the more dense (heavier) rock higher up tends to sink, and the hotter rock (lighter) near the center tends to rise. Thus the molten rock in the mantle circulates. From the surface it sinks down towards the center, where it gets hotter, expands, then rises back towards the surface, only to cool down again and sink again. The patterns of circulation of molten rock in the mantle are called \"convection currents\". Convection currents in the mantle form circular patterns, so in addition to up and down movement, there is also sideways movement. At the outer surface, the earth's crust is broken up into pieces, called \"plates\". These plates are floating on the mantle, but the sideways movement in the mantle from convection currents also makes the plates floating on top want to move as well. This force causing movement of plates is the power that builds mountain ranges and causes earthquakes. Where there are borders between two plates, one plate may be trying to move in a different direction from the other plate. They can be moving towards each other, away from each other, or they can be sliding past each other. Two plates moving towards each other gradually creates mountain ranges. Two plates moving away from each other gradually creates low basins that will be covered with water - oceans. And two plates sliding past each other causes earthquake faults, such as California's San Andreas fault. ",
