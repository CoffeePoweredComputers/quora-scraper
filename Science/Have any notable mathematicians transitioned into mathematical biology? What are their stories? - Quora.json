            "answer_text": "I would advocate for Stanis\u0142aw Ulam as an example.  He was born 1909 in Lemberg(now Lviv, Ukraine). He started to study Mathematics due to his interest in Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity and worked after that with Stefan Banach and Kazimierz Kuratowski in the mathematical school of Lemberg. His main interest then were measure theory, set theory and topology. He refers to his work there such as: Originally I worked in set theory and some of these problems are still being worked on intensively. It is too technical to describe: measurable cardinals, measure in set theory, abstract measure. Then in topology I had a few results. ... The mathematician there often worked together in the cafe\u2019s of the city and wrote on the marmor tables their results. Many problems of that time are written into the Scottish book(it\u2019s called that way since they met in the Scottish Cafe). Adapting to the working method of the American mathematicians was a bit difficult once he worked there. Ulam later translated and published that book in English.  A part of the scottish book John von Neumann invited him to the US, where he worked on Ergodic theory. This is a subject of dynamical system and was inspired by statistical physics and quantum mechanics. He continued to live in the US and in Poland, but managed to flee Poland a few days before the start of the second World War.  Ulam (right) with Richard Feynman and John von Neumann John von Neumann then again invited him to some mysterious technical project in New Mexico, even though Ulam by his account understood nothing of technical devices, not even how the toilet flush in the station\u2019s toilet where they met worked. This was the Manhattan Project where he together with Edward Teller developed the Teller-Ulam-design for hydrogen bombs eventhough that later didn\u2019t agree who did the most important contribution to it. His probably most important work was together with von Neumann on the Monte-Carlo-Method which uses the law of large numbers to generate insight. Instead of having to calculate a difficult integral directly, you randomly choose many numbers and from the percentage of numbers you can guess the area under the curve. He used the method to inverstigate many problems in physics and biology. After the war he was however struck by an illness, which according to Gian-Carlo Rota changed his personality: One morning in 1946, in Los Angeles, Stanis\u0142aw Ulam, a newly appointed professor at the University of Southern California, awoke to find himself unable to speak. A few hours later, he underwent a dangerous surgical operation after the diagnosis of encephalitis. ... In time, however, some changes in his personality became obvious to those who knew him. ... his ideas, which he spouted out at odd intervals, were fascinating beyond anything I have witenssed before or since. However, he seemed to studiously avoid going into details. ... he came to lean on his unimpaired imagination for his ideas, and on the [hard work] of others for technical support. ... A crippling technical weakness coupled with an extraordinarily creative imagination is the drama of Stan Ulam. Soon after I met him, I was made to understand that, as far as our conversations went, his drama would be one of the Forbidden Topics. ... But he knew I knew, and I knew he knew I knew. After he recovered and did some university hopping he became a professor of biomathematics at the University of Colorado. In his biomathematical research he mostly modeled evolutionary processes and researched molecule sequences. Together with von Neumann he was also a pioneer of cellular automata, which is now a research area of Stephen Wolfram. Another crossing point between his biology research and in computer science are some early works in artificial intelligence and artificial recognition. He did as well some interesting conjectures in pure mathematics. The Ulam spiral, which marks all prime numbers after all numbers are written in spiral form and creates diagonal lines. The reason of this pattern isn\u2019t explained till today. He worked as well on the Collatz conjecture.  The Ulam spiral A description of him by Rota: Ulam's mind is a repository of thousands of stories, tales, jokes, epigrams, remarks, puzzles, tounge-twisters, footnotes, conclusions, slogans, formulas, diagrams, quotations, limericks, summaries, quips, epitaphs, and headlines. In the course of a normal conversation he simply pulls out of his mind the fifty-odd relevant items, and presents them in linear succession. A second-order memory prevents him from repeating himself too often before the same public. And by Ulam\u2019s wife Fran\u00e7oise about his working style: Ulam ... is almost exculsively a talking man, a verbal person. When not thinking ... what he enjoys most is to talk, to discuss, to argue, to converse, with friends and colleagues. Relying on his phenomenal memory, he carries everything in his head. ... The physical act of taking pen to paper has always been painful for him. His mind and his eyes are the obstacles. His mind, because it works much faster than his fingers...; his eyes because one is very myopic the other very presbyotic. ... From childhood fears, then from youthful vanity he spurned wearing glasses, until very recently. Thus Ulam has always had a very hard time bringing himself to write anything for publication, either in long hand or with a typewriter. Machines and other mechanical objects have always turned him off. ... How then does he ever produce a written text? Mainly by talking ...
