            "answer_text": "Usually, the only symptom of molluscum contagiosum is the tiny bumps on the skin. These flesh-colored or pearly growths look somewhat like tiny pimples with a central crater. A waxy substance may come out of the bumps when they are squeezed. Bullae are raised, fluid-filled bumps that can result from friction, or conditions like contact dermatitis and chickenpox. Cherry angiomas are common skin growths that can form on most areas of the body. They develop when blood vessels clump together and create a raised, bright-red bump under or on the skin.
