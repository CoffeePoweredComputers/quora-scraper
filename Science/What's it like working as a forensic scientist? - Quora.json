            "answer_text": "I work in a major metropolitan police lab doing DNA work, but I've worked at two other agencies as well, one larger and one smaller, so I have an idea of what's \"normal\" across the board for the field. My jobs have been hourly, 40 hr/week normal day work hours. Pay has ranged from around 60-110k/yr, which is pretty decent given the lack of a requirement for an advanced degree. They have also had access to essentially unlimited overtime money (1.5x hourly rate) due to the yearly presence of federal forensic lab case backlog reduction grants, which a few people use to support slightly more lavish lifestyles than you might expect for a government worker or to allow a spouse to not work, as they can boost their income by 10-30k a year if they really try.  This is something that is unique to DNA work though, as it is definitely considered the jewel of the forensic science crown, providing results and conclusions that are significantly more useful in court than many of the other forensic disciplines. I feel like I should stress this point -- I've always worked in DNA, so my experience may be quite different from someone who works in drug analysis or spends a lot of time responding to crime scene calls (like on CSI). I've only gone into the field a few times and those times were more as a \"coworker ride along\" kind of affair where I was definitely more like baggage than an asset. Those few times really showed me the night and day difference between my job and others though -- the analogy would be that if we were in the military, my job is like some paper pusher at a desk at a base in the midwest while the crime scene scientists are more like the special forces who get deployed at a moments notice to crazy locations, deal with crazy situations that are never the same and are expected to function at 100% in very challenging situations. My particular job is great for family life since I have really regular hours, but for the people in the field it's kind of the opposite, so that crew is mostly younger single people. This brings me to one of the pros: you're generally one of the more interesting people in a room at a gathering, whether or not you do what I do or whether you're working on crime scenes (although they always have the best stories).  I can't think of many cons -- generally it's like a \"normal\" lab job (which I've also had). One might dislike the very by-the-book approach that all testing is performed by -- I know that a lot of PhDs don't really enjoy being in that box after having had years of free rein to pursue scientific goals however they saw fit. Another possible con would be testifying in court if you fear public speaking or are not in control of your emotions.  All in all, it's an interesting profession that has decent pay and gives you the opportunity to feel like you're making a difference in the world.  ",

            "answer_text": "From the lab's perspective:No one does everything, it takes a LOT longer than it looks, and it is meticulous, exacting work. We joke that the minimum expectation is perfection, but it isn't far from truth. There is no forgiveness in court for mistakes,  so we do a lot of extra work to make sure we are giving the right answer every time. I tell students we don't wear stiletto heels and tank tops or drive around in Hummers. It isn't sexy or glamorous, you will bring cases home in your head and have nightmares, and you can't talk about the case to anyone outside work, so they stick for a while. That part is like police work- maintaining confidentiality after seeing or working things that come back in the middle of the night. But we aren't cops, either. We aren't invested in a particular arrest.We speak for the evidence. We don't favor prosecution or defense; our objectivity is our most valuable trait in the courtroom, because both sides can use the results as they see fit, but we have to be trusted to be impartial. We tell the court what the evidence tells us, no more, no less.Those that succeed in forensics are passionate about it, they love doing their part to serve the community.  If your goal is to make money, this isn't for you- private industry pays scientists much more than public service.  But not being able to imagine doing anything else is priceless. Not to mention everyone you meet thinks you are fascinating. Even when you aren't! ",

            "answer_text": "In real life, the detectives very rarely do any of their own photography and collection of evidence. They would call in professional Crime Scene Technicians. These technicians, usually clad in heavy utility pants, boots, and a polo, do all of the processing on scene. They do not go to scenes in dress pants, button down shirt, and heels. The CSTs do not conducts interviews/interrogations. That is saved for the detectives. Most CSTs are civilian personnel, meaning the they are not sworn officers, have no arresting powers, and do not carry firearms. The detectives rely heavily on the photos and evidence collected by the CST. Many times the evidence could be sent to a separate lab for processing, and CSTs are a specialized field that usually does not include the ability to do heavy forensic work, like chem and bio, due to the fact that education/training takes years, and analysis on one object could take a while. The time it takes to process items is also greatly reduced by television (Print comparisons in real life take several hours once started, and the may be a backlog of several months before it is even looked at. DNA on tv takes minutes, whereas in real life it could take three months or more). ",

It\u2019s a good career for those interested in science, technology, and law enforcement. With management support, you should be provided appropriate supervision, mentoring, on-the-job training and refresher training to maintain best practices. You should be encouraged to network and share information with your peers and join professional organizations. A good quality assurance program should be in place as well as standard operating procedures for examinations. Good management will make the job a rewarding experience. ",

Put on a white smock and dove into and endless series of samples, tests and printouts. She would take off the smock and go to court or depositions or meetings. Back to the lab. Long hours interrupted by visits and calls from me. We used to eat take out in the lab's firearms range. On weekends and in her spare time she did contact serology out of a private lab. Good money but no time to spend it. I invested her money for her. She retired very well off. Wonderful woman! ",
