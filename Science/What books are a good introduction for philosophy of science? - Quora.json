            "answer_text": "You should read Karl Popper\u2019s Logic of Scientific Discovery. Popper made significant thesis on what is science with his fasfiability and testability doctrines. The book also explores other aspects of theory building, for instance structure and definition of simplicity. From classical philosophy, you should read Hegel \u2018s Phenomenology of History. It deals with epistemology of science, perhaps the best treatment in epistemology. Hegel is difficult to read and thereby less understood and sometimes rubbished (et al Schopenhauer). You may come across Bertrand Russel. However I am not a big fan of him, if I understood him well. ",
