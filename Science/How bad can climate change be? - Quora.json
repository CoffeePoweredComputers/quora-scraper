            "answer_text": "I would like to be more concrete and practical in my answer than others. I have degrees in geology, geophysics, and the atmospheric sciences from Yale and Colorado State. And, I work in for-profit business, as a risk manager, for insurance companies who need models. But I warn you - my sarcasm\u2019s intact. To someone\u2019s post below, the insurance boom-and-bust cycle is at an historic low (a \u201csoft\u201d or over-competitive market) in which the fundamentals are outweighing the technicals. There is too much capital supply in the insurance market, which is weighing on prices - this means that although rates may \u201cseem\u201d to be rising, they don\u2019t yet reflect the true risk. Not even close. Most of the industry is frankly losing a lot of money right now. Combined ratios of 110% are common. In the immediate concrete, where are the losses and impacts, at least here in the US? Two places: floods, and that\u2019s in many broad areas of the US though not all, and in tornado/hail. Oh, and droughts. And wildfires. These things are already happening - they may feel like \u201cthe new normal,\u201d but they are indeed climate change, whether they are experienced as weather or not. Even on El Nino oscillations I would be curious as to what the climate models predict. If your community is growing quickly, I can guarantee that your civil engineers will not keep up. I\u2019ve lived in Fort Collins, Northern California, the Philly suburbs, and now Rhode Island: all of these places either have been recently or will soon be hit by either flash floods or river floods in the recent past or reasonable future. Tornado and hail losses have reached the annual tens of billions in the US alone. Keep in mind that as long as insurers - including Uncle Sam, the insurer of last resort - continue to lose billions of dollars, of course you aren\u2019t \u201cfeeling\u201d the impact yet. Don\u2019t worry. Climate change will become \u201crelevant\u201d in your life time. Depends on how long your memory is - like cooking a lobster in a cabin on the Cape after chasing it around the kitchen a while, you start with luke warm water, and then you gradually anesthetize the lobster while you turn up the heat to the new normal\u2026. by the time you \u201ccare,\u201d it will be irreversible. Baked in. Your brain evolved to run from tigers and bears - you\u2019re just not designed to act on fear at the appropriate time scales. MRIs of the brain on climate change show apathy. To get you to act, we would need to capitalize the entire cost in real terms today, as well as personalize it. Kind of like pricing the company for whom you work and then giving you a share. Some people speak of the mixture of clothing in your closet - they fail to mention the galoshes and the hip waders. You don\u2019t state your socioeconomic status - the poor and middle class will take most of this, including those living in low-lying and other vulnerable areas, not to mention the fact that the poor-and-flood-prone are subsidizing the rich-and-flood-prone through FEMA. It turns out that in a poll, an overwhelming majority of Americans think that climate change will matter in their lifetimes. But get this - 99% of them think that it will happen to \u201cother people.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s right - we are the 1 percent! We have defined climate change as \u201cstigma.\u201d Good people don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d climate change. It\u2019s an untouchable affliction to Americans. Poll said so. The good news is that studies now show that the world can get there WITHOUT the United States. We\u2019re just not needed to the Paris Agreement anymore. If the world stays in one piece, we\u2019ll be economic bystanders eventually. They have calculated that they can get to the 1.5 C goal without us. We\u2019re all alone out there. Oh, and Russia, too, apparently. p.s. the Geology grad below does not reveal who employs him, or where his investments are. Many geologists are \u201cskeptics.\u201d They work in oil. For your info.

            "answer_text": "There is a lot of fear regarding climate change. Ominous predictions are circulating about melting ice caps, flooded coasts and worldwide destruction. The majority of this information comes from the United Nations IPCC reports and apocalyptic models that have predicted changes that never materialized. The climate has been changing since the Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. It will continue to change in the future.  There are alarmist who flog the notion that these are the end times because measurable CO2 has increased over the past century. One of the great debates, rarely addressed, is; is increased CO2 responsible for the corresponding rise in temperature ordo concentrations of CO2 follow the increase in temperatures, as it has done historically.It is important to remember that there is no baseline for CO2 levels, hence there is no perfect concentration of gases in the atmosphere. That being said greenhouses routinely raise CO2 levels to increase plant growth. Perhaps if a tree could speak, it would say \u201cmore carbon dioxide if you please\u201d. The taiga forests have responded quite well to the additional CO2. Here is an excerpt from a Scientific American article \u201cThe boreal forest seems to like the higher levels of carbon dioxide. All that carbon appears to be enabling growth rates not seen in human history for the northernmost forest, according to a new study.\u201d  Here\u2019s an idea, plant more trees. The atmosphere and the Earth are not a closed system, like some planet in a bell jar. Concentrations of any gas are always subject to change. While some models may predict dire consequences other models, that do not simultaneously raise water vapor concentrations along with CO2, show little dynamic rise in temperature. Hollywood makes a ton of money from ecological disaster films. Its what they do. Try sitting in an auditorium filled with geologists and see all the fun go out of the room, as people are compelled to describe the inaccuracies of the movie at the most inconvenient time. The current rise of sea level is 7 inches per century. If you intend on buying beach front property, your investment is safe regardless of human industry. ",

            "answer_text": "It appears the Question has changed considerably since my answer! Oh well just FYI on the apparent non-sequitor answer\u2026 Ah - finally, a decent Question on climate change! The very short version is that \u201cweather\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d are only loosely linked. Depending on where you live, the weather (as opposed to the climate) might get a little hotter - but it could even get cooler too. That sounds counterintuitive I'm sure, but it's consistent with the global impact of climate change. So for various reasons (primarily excess CO2 produced by humans acting like a thermal blanket), the entire earth is warming slightly. But the key thing is that this warmth is not just a passive thermometer reading where everything everywhere gets warmer by a few degrees, so what? - that warmth is an indication of increased energy into our global weather system. And since the earth is a very big place, even just a couple degrees represents a LOT of energy. Btw: this requires thinking big-picture. Some people like \u201csystems thinking\u201d but others have a hard time with it. So I really encourage you to keep thinking about the GLOBAL SYSTEM - not just this place or that weather, but how everything flows and interacts at a huge scale. So what happens when you inject energy into a dynamic system? Things start to move. Consider a pot of water, mixed hot and cold, on the stove. When one turns the heat on the first thing is NOT the entire pot gets hotter evenly; the greater heat/energy causes movement - you can see it at the top, and you could measure it with instruments. There are still (shrinking) patches of cold water, but they are swirling around and becoming more dynamic. On earth you see this in many ways. The biggest effect isn't necessarily warmth where you are - but you see everywhere more hurricanes, more tornadoes, more heat waves, more extreme cold, more flooding then more drought - and everything strangely out of season. A couple years ago there was extreme cold in the north and Midwest US. This was caused by more dynamic (energetic) polar winds pushing cold air further south than is normal. You might see more snow in places - because increased ocean heat is putting more water into the air, which comes down as rain and snow. But it's not just cold effects - at the same time were killing heat waves across Europe, and Africa and the Middle East have records droughts. So the biggest immediate problem with global warming isn't just \u201cheat\u201d but the dangerous energy inputs to an already dynamic system. But there IS increased heat, and that's causing problems too. In particular, ocean currents are being impacted, which can have huge effects on the climate in different countries. For instance, by latitude western Europe should be a lot colder - but it's not cold because the Labrador current carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico to the north, warming the water and the air. A possible result of a warming ocean is for that current to \u201ccollapse\u201d which will allow the northern currents to dominate, Europe to become much colder and less habitable. Not to mention the collapse of fish and animals that depend on that current. Another example is Peru: they have huge glaciers that feed the entire continent and also the Amazon. But those glaciers are shrinking, melting faster than snow can accumulate each year. At some point those glaciers will be gone, resulting in devastating drought - the Amazon, the biggest river system in the world - will collapse. This is a Very Bad Thing. One could write many books on each of these topics - and many HAVE been written! But the KEY thing is that the weather where you are is less meaningful than the changes to the overall global systems. That said, the long term effects are dire. For the next while the US coasts and the northwest will be fine. But eventually the lower latitudes will become deserts and not habitable - ditto for most of Africa and southern Europe btw. Before there are deserts there will be incredible erosion from a mix of occasional huge rains separated by drought. The US will cease being a crop exporter. The impact on livelihood will be extreme. Anyway, here's the mantra: weather and climate are different. Climate drives weather, but short-term and local weather doesn't indicate what the global system is doing. Added later: rising oceans are mostly - but not entirely - a longer term problem. Yes the net rate is very small, and it'll be a very long time before my house (at about 150\u2032 above sea level) will become ocean front property. HOWEVER, when you add just a few inches of water rise to the exaggerated storm surge from climate change, the effects are compounded. We already see this in low-lying islands that already suffered from hurricanes - adding an inch or two of sea level to the increased hurricanes and tornadoes is making them completely uninhabitable.

            "answer_text": "It will depend on what steps we take to minimize climate change. A significant amount is likely locked in already since we continue to put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and the effects are cumulative to some degree. This means that if we added no more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere from now on, the average temperature of the Earth would still increase for at least decades. Of course the rate of increase would continuously drop. Every economy is now partly local, partly national and partly global. Even if climate change produces no negative effects in your region, national and global problems from climate change will still affect you. These could include lower growth rates in GDP making it harder for you to keep or improve your standard of living. Food supplies and quality could be affected. Some regions will do better and some worse. The crops that grow better with more CO2 include some that become less nutritious. You may then need to eat more of some plants to get all the nutrition you need for good health. You might even need to spend a bit of money on supplements. More CO2 dissolved in oceans changes ocean chemistry, and this can reduce fish stocks in oceans already stressed with overfishing and other poor fishing practices. This will raise the cost of fish and lead to scarcity in some regions. One of the sure things on the basis that it has already been documented as happening for over 50 years with multiple lines of research is that there will be more water vapor in the atmosphere and more precipitation. This also follows so definitely from basic thermodynamics that any model of warming oceans and atmospheres that doesn\u2019t include significant increases in atmospheric water vapor, precipitation and flooding can\u2019t be taken seriously. But as I just wrote, all of these have already been happening for decades. They are likely to get worse. Rising sea levels will force relocations and migrations in many places in the world, and these include places with little wealth that could make such changes bearable. These migrations and relocations are likely to cause tensions that will lead to instability which can fuel warfare. There could be increasing rates of species extinctions, and the rate is already high compared to long term averages. These are just a few things that I can think of in a short period of time. The changes that can affect you are not limited to these. Since we can do more than we are to reduce the increases in greenhouse gas concentrations while spending little more per capita than we are today, it makes sense to take appropriate action to minimize the potential effects.

Can you really find the space to house them all, and still grow enough food on the reduced farmland area? And don't expect that Climate Change will not always lead to warming. Here, in Britain, it is likely that when the Gulf Stream turns off, because of the influx of fresh water when the Arctic ice melts, we will get a Very Cool reception, perhaps even to the point of Scottish Snow-capped Mountains becoming a year round tourist attraction! All that snow-covered land isn't great for growing vegetables or fruit, either, so there will be much less food grown, worldwide, and the cost of food will rise, leaving the poorer people of the world struggling to afford to feed their families.

            "answer_text": "This was my response to a guy\u2019s question (copied and pasted): \u201cHow bad can I be?\u201d Yeh. Plenty of people can be bad and ask just to convince themselves that they're not bad. So this answer is invalid.  Onceler: \u201cBad? No, I'm not bad! I\u2019m the good guy here. He just doesn't get it.\u201d Onceler: \u201cDo you think I\u2019m bad?\u201d Duck: \u201cQuack.\u201d Onceler: \u201cThank you!\u201d Onceler: \u201cI mean, something good finally happens to me, and he just has to come and rain on my brain! What\u2019s his problem?\u201d Duck: \u201cQuack.\u201d Onceler: \u201cSee?\u201d What was funny about this movie was how the Lorax did NOTHING to EXPLAIN to the Onceler why what he was doing was wrong. Why would you expect the Onceler to do as he said if you\u2019re not going to explain the reasoning behind it?  Lorax: \u201cStop! This is bad! You\u2019re bad!\u201d Lorax: \u201cHmphhh\u201d -The Lorax, Speaker of for da treesies Yes, that\u2019s very comprehensive, Lorax. What this movie missed was the fact that if the average temperature of the atmosphere increased, things like tropical storms would become stronger, larger and last much longer due to the lack of difference in air pressure between the hurricane and the air around it. The storm gets its kinetic energy from the thermal energy in the water it picks up. If the air is more humid that means a) the hurricane will take longer to lose its energy, b) there is far more water to draw in and the water near the centre of the eye would have more energy so the storm would be stronger, c) tropical storms would become more common. It will mean tropical storms can survive longer on land, will last longer in general and will be much larger and stronger. That's just one of the reasons climate change would be a problem. It is changing too fast for us, and the earth\u2019s animals, to evolve with it because we have sped up this process. Even if it was a conspiracy, it wouldn't hurt to have an infinite source of energy. Fossil fuels will not last forever and will not replenish themselves quickly enough to continue to be of use, carbon emissions can still react with water vapour to produce rain that is more acidic. Burning things produces carbon monoxide at a much higher rate than in normal respiration. The more carbon emissions from burning, the more concentrated the acid rain will be. This makes crops less nutritious and in some cases can kill them, which is a problem because this acidity is increasing faster than plants can adapt to it. There will eventually come a point where we can't grow any more crops or any more trees, if it speeds up at its current rate. And that's a big issue. So even if climate change was a hoax, which it's very unlikely to be considering these experiments are repeated time and time again, is peer-reviewed and all the evidence is looked at instead of a small select group, it is the best explanation that accounts for the largest portion of evidence for all the evidence scientists have. The reason people don't want to accept it is because in their minds it would imply that we were wrong to do the things that we did; but that's why we're trying to change things. It is especially religious people who want to believe that the human species as a whole can do no wrong. So even if it was a hoax, it doesn't matter. Because renewable energy does not hurt us in the long run either way. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: How bad can climate change be? I don't really understand how climate change affects me. People are talking about excessive heat waves and droughts but it is not that hot where I live and we seem to have plenty of water here so how bad could climate change be? A: How bad just for you? Well, that depends. How old are you? Where do you live? The thing about the climate change issue is that it\u2019s really NOT about \u201cHow bad for me?\u201d It IS about \u201cHow bad for humanity?\u201d Plus, \u201cHow bad for non-human species?\u201d The most negative impacts of our changing climate are many decades away. I\u2019m 58, and I live in a wealthy country, in a house that\u2019s well above sea level, so I expect that there won\u2019t be much in the way of negative impacts for me personally. But I\u2019ve read enough about the harm that will come to others in the future to understand that it is critically important for the world to take meaningful steps to mitigate the harmful impacts of climate change. Right now, our circumstances call for a good dose of altruism. It is mainly future generations that we are trying to protect, not ourselves. 2\u20134 degrees C of warming may not seem like much, but this amount of warming will have huge global consequences. It will change local weather patterns, causing droughts in areas not accustomed to droughts, and increases in precipitation in areas not used to that much rainfall. It will cause massive species migrations, with many species likely to not survive the change. It will cause changes in growing seasons, timing of pollination, migration patterns and other such effects that will upset delicate balances between co-dependent species. It will result in another global mass extinction. Areas that currently rely on snowpack for their year-round water supply, like California, will suffer severe water shortages when less snowfall in higher elevations, plus quicker snowmelt, combine to cause much of the water supply to flow to the ocean and be wasted, instead of being conveniently stored as ice for much of the year in the high mountains. Sea level rise over the course of the next few decades will be manageable in most coastal areas, but 100 or 200 years down the road, the sea level rise could be more than 10 feet (possible much more), with enormous consequences to low-lying areas. Climate change will eventually render certain areas much more inhospitable to human life than today. It will almost certain create a refugee crisis that will dwarf anything the world is currently dealing with by orders of magnitude. The world is currently showing quite clearly that it does not handle refugees well. Imagine what it\u2019ll be like to multiply our current refugee situation by ten, or by a hundred. So much of this is totally unnecessary. We can replace most of our fossil fuel-based energy consumption with renewables, with a manageable upfront investment paying dividends down the roads many times over. At least, we can do it if we reject the efforts of those who profit from the status quo to scare us into delay and inaction. ",

Looking at worst case scenarios: A recent discovery by scientists that the Thwaites glacier in Antarctica is about to collapse in the next few decades or even years indicates that we could have 10 to 13 feet of sea level rise by 2060 or even 2050. This would force us to evacuate almost all areas near the sea, including major cities. Aside from creating tens of millions of climate refugees (people rendered homeless and jobless due to climate change), it would also cut off all access to ports, cutting off international shipping, fishing, and sea food collection (shrimping, crabbing, etc.). That many lost jobs and homeless people could collapse our economy and social structure, leading to our civilization descending into chaos. Another study showed that a 6 degree C rise in temperature could kill of all the phytoplankton in the ocean. Since this phytoplankton supplies 70% of the oxygen in the world, this die-off of phytoplankton would be an extinction event for all animal life on Earth. A separate study calculated that we have a 10% chance of reaching 6 degree C rise by 2100 (and that was conducted before Trump became President and shut down all US efforts to stop climate change), so we are looking at a 10% chance of that happening by 2100. Runaway greenhouse effect, otherwise known as the Venus Syndrome because it happened on Venus, is an effect where warming leads to release of more CO2 and other greenhouse gases (including water vapor), which leads to more warming, and so on, until the temperature goes above the boiling point of water and all water evaporates, leaving a dead planet. Unlikely, but possible. Warming of the oceans can stop the churning effect that supports life in the ocean, resulting in the release of hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas. Again, massive extinction of most life on Earth. More likely than the runaway greenhouse effect, but still unlikely. So, \u201cHow bad\u201d ranges from the collapse of our civilization to the end of all life on Earth. Again, these are worst case scenarios, but you did ask how bad it could get. ",

            "answer_text": "NOT BAD if you are worried about global warming as it has paused or stopped and in any event has been entirely beneficial. There is clear evidence with the expansion of Arctic ice, the falling of sea levels globally, cooling of the North Atlantic and the brutal winter polar vortex with massive snowfall everywhere that there is no global warming to become a crisis. The so called warming crisis was phony only based on fudged and misleading historical data like the infamous Michael Mann hockey stick graph of warming removing our past climates.  A far more devastating crisis for humans will be the next ice age which as night follows day will happen - usually every 100,000 years and we are well on the way. Will it be just a little ice age like the earth experienced from 1600 to 1770 or are we in for the monstrous SNOWBALL EARTH ICE AGE of 650 million years ago? NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SNOWBALL EARTH 650 MILLION YEARS AGO  VERY BAD if climate change is cooling not warming and leads to the SNOWBALL EARTH APOCALYPSE. What is that? Complete glaciation of the earth. It has happened three times in the past. The relevance of this most dramatic ice age is that recent palaeontology research delving into the key question what caused SNOWBALL EARTH 650 million years ago is relevant to what causes climate change today? The research concludes as between solar radiation and Co2 the former wins hand down as the culprit. The Snowball Earth hypothesis proposes that Earth's surface became entirely or nearly entirely frozen at least once, sometime earlier than 650 Mya (million years ago). Freezing weather with albedo feedback locked temperatures into a downward spiral.The climate history of the runaway snow albedo causing \u2018an ice covered earth\u2019 ended most plant and animal life 700 million years ago.  SNOWBALL EARTH Snowball Earth - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sn... Ice- and snow-covered areas have high albedo, and an ice-covered Arctic reflects solar radiation which otherwise would be absorbed by the oceans and cause the Earth's surface to heat up. The proportion of the Earth's surface that is covered by snow and ice has a great deal to say for how much of the incoming solar radiation is reflected or absorbed. Low albedo (dark surfaces) leads to higher uptake of energy and, hence, warming. Moreover, when more ice and snow melt, there will be more dark surfaces. This is therefore a self-reinforcing effect. Climate change in the Arctic is consequently important for the development of climate change globally. http://www.npolar.no/en/facts/al... Norwegian Polar Institute An extreme ice age hit the planet around 717 million years ago. Known as the Sturtian glaciation, this event is more informally dubbed \"Snowball Earth\" and it's thought to be the most extreme, and long-lasting, ice age the planet ever experienced. For around 50 million years, the entire globe was essentially covered in ice. https://newatlas.com/rise-of-algae-snowball-earth-animal-evolution/50934/#gallery The research about the Sturtian glaciation devastating earth millions of years ago finds the snow albedo is the major cause not Co2. This is relevant to the debate today about the causes of climate change.  Effect of land albedo, CO2, orography, and oceanic heat transport on extreme climates V. Romanova1 , G. Lohmann2,3, and K. Grosfeld2,3 1 Institute of Oceanography, University of Hamburg, 20146 Hamburg, Germany 2Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, 27515 Bremerhaven, Germany 3Department of Physics, University of Bremen, Otto-Hahn-Allee, 330440 Bremen, Germany Received: 11 October 2005 \u2013 Published in Clim. Past Discuss.: 7 December 2005 Revised: 2 June 2006 \u2013 Accepted: 2 June 2006 \u2013 Published: 30 June 2006 Abstract. Using an atmospheric general circulation model of intermediate complexity coupled to a sea ice \u2013 slab ocean model, we perform a number of sensitivity experiments under present-day orbital conditions and geographical distribution to assess the possibility that land albedo, atmospheric CO2, orography and oceanic heat transport may cause an ice covered Earth. Changing only one boundary or initial condition, the model produces solutions with at least some ice free oceans in the low latitudes. Using some combination of these forcing parameters, a full Earth\u2019s glaciation is obtained. We find that the most significant factor leading to an ice-covered Earth is the high land albedo in combination with initial temperatures set equal to the freezing point.Oceanic heat transport and orography play only a minor role for the climate state. Extremely low concentrations of CO2 also appear to be insufficient to provoke a runaway ice-albedo feedback, but the strong deviations in surface air temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere point to the existence of a strong nonlinearity in the system. Finally, we argue that the initial condition determines whether the system can go into a completely ice covered state, indicating multiple equilibria, a feature known from simple energy balance models. https://www.clim-past.net/2/31/2... HOW DOES THE SNOW ALBEDO WORK? Albedo is an expression of the ability of surfaces to reflect sunlight (heat from the sun). Light-coloured surfaces return a large part of the sunrays back to the atmosphere (high albedo). Dark surfaces absorb the rays from the sun (low albedo).  As the simple graph shows snow reflects 85% of sunlight back into space making the climate cooler. Ice- and snow-covered areas have high albedo, and an ice-covered Arctic reflects solar radiation which otherwise would be absorbed by the oceans and cause the Earth's surface to heat up. The proportion of the Earth's surface that is covered by snow and ice has a great deal to say for how much of the incoming solar radiation is reflected or absorbed. Low albedo (dark surfaces) leads to higher uptake of energy and, hence, warming. Moreover, when more ice and snow melt, there will be more dark surfaces. This is therefore a self-reinforcing effect. Climate change in the Arctic is consequently important for the development of climate change globally.  http://www.npolar.no/en/facts/al.. . Norwegian Polar Institute As the Arctic expands with increased ice and snow the snow albedo is triggered and that makes the temperature colder like we witnessed this year. The snow albedo from the Arctic is a loop where cold gets colder and so on. This is surely a more common sense explanation than the bizarre unproved theory that global warming causes the shift in Arctic air. Also there are major science peer reviewed papers that identify the ALBEDO as the cause of this unique cooling. You will have witnessed the snow albedo significant impact is you hiked or skied in cloudless fresh snow covered mountains like this. So much solar light is reflected off the snow it can cause blindness just like watching the sun.

It is pseudo - science. The alarmist and media are very MISLEADING on this issue by seeing a bit of warming as global and dangerous and ignoring the massive freezing winters around the world recently by claiming they are caused by warming??? IMPOSSIBLE ORWELLIAN ILLOGIC Good example was the drought in California in 2015\u201317 while record cold weather across the US. OBAMA said drought was climate change a record cold was just weather.

            "answer_text": "Im no expert or anything, but I have done plenty of reading. If you want extensive information, I can recommend a very good book that is an easy read for the general public. Its called 6 degrees and its by Mark Lynas, every chapter explains the possible future climate related outcomes and scenarios degree by degree, 1 degree temperature rise means the ice caps are rapidly melting year by year ( higher sea levels = less land to live on), stronger and more frequent droughts and floods will result in scarcity of food and habitable land. And as temperatures rise even further, whole ecosystems will colapse as they cannot evolve fast enough with the rate of climate change. Millions of years ago the Earth went through a similar change where temperatures rose outstandingly high, however the rate of change in temperature took thousands and thousands of years to play out, so species had enough time to adapt to the new circumstances. This time round the rate of temperature rise is exceeding previously predicted models of climate change and recent computer models have calculated that the Earth could be 3\u20134 degrees warmer as close as 2050, given us less than a decade to prepare ans drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and methane gasses) globally. Just imagine all organisms on earth as living cells in a body, our planet. If one organ or cell fails, it isnt to dramatic, but if another cell/organ depends on the function of that specific cell/organ or a particular environment or condition for it to carry out its function, it wont take long before that organism is lifeless. If our oceans become toxic due to temperature rise, most to all life in the ocean will die. If the ice caps start melting away and the rainfall starts to decrease, countries will have no sources of drinkable water, causing conflict between countries and possible migration to nothern countries where agriculture is still functioning well. Warmer currents and winds in the ocean can sometimes trigger hurricanes and tsunamis which will clash more frequently, worse and more powerful than ever before recorded in human history. Massive forest fires will destroy habitable land and release even more gasses into the atomosphere further warming the globe. To give you scale of how much a few degrees can change things, the global temperatures in tje last ice age where only 5\u20137 degrees colder than they are today, while the whole northern hemisphere was covered in kms of ice for thousands of years until it came to an end 12,000 years leaving only around 30\u201340,000 humans on earth. Basically climate change is real, its happening and there is no way out if, there is only trying to limit the speed and severity of the rise in temperature. ",

            "answer_text": "For the better part of ten years, Dr. Guy McPherson has been advancing the viewpoint that we\u2019ve passed a point of no return on global warming and will experience full blown runaway warming leading to mass extinction by 2030 at the latest. He has more recently dialed his estimates back to 2026 (and sooner if Arctic Ice collapses earlier). While many disparage his estimates, more scientists have been joining the group predicting extinction. Most recent notables include Dr. Paul Ehrlich of POPULATION BOMB fame, who co-wrote a peer reviewed paper published in 2017 asserting that Earth is already in the Sixth Mass Extinction, and vertebrates will be the first to go en masse. Debate was further sparked last year by an article in NYMAG that echoed most of McPherson\u2019s talking points. I wrote about its conclusions here: The Cassandra problem Most recently, Dr. James Anderson (the scientist who \u2018saved\u2019 the ozone layer through the creation of the Montreal Protocols) told an audience in Chicago that there was \u2018zero chance\u2019 we\u2019d still have Arctic Ice in four years (2022). Most climate scientists understand that loss of Arctic Ice would mean runaway warming and mass extinction not long after. THAT is how bad climate change is. The recent reports from the IPCC Sixth Assessment and the US Fourth National Climate Assessment both predict extinction level temperatures by 2100, and both reports are highly optimistic. The IPCC has never explained the methane release issue that would accompany loss of sea ice, and thus its predictions are considered suspect. Methane release of a mere 5% of the methane clathrates would drive up average temperatures by 1 C or more. Dr. Peter Wadhams (who has recently wrote a book \u2018FAREWELL TO ICE\u2019 and is considered the most qualified scientist to write on the subject) noted that the IPCC lacks scientists competent in his field(ocean physics) to contribute to their assessments. The same is true of the methane threat\u2014through lack of foresight or desire to suppress the science, the IPCC scientific staff doesn\u2019t have enough specialists in methane to assess the threat of the firing of the \u2018Clathrate gun\u2019.

That would make the equatorial zone hotter as there is no current taking the heat away. The most credible predictions are the ones that say we will start by getting more extreme weather events: floods as well as droughts. Long cold dry spells, long wet windy spells, storms. This has been a bad year for typhoons in the Eastern Pacific, but we haven\u2019t seen a really bad hurricane in the Western Atlantic since Sandy hit New York. Weather is intrinsically variable. Where I live we are having a really long dry spell. The heavy rain has been coming the day after tomorrow for about six weeks and the ground is really hard. Is this just normal variation? There have been dry springs before. There will be wet springs again. But the dry springs may be dryer and the wet ones wetter. But that\u2019s only half of it. The continent of Africa, and much of southern Europe could be uninhabitable by the end of the century. That\u2019s two billion people who will have to find somewhere else to live.

In fact, CO2 levels have not been this high since the Eocene, a geological era some 50 million years ago. Therefore, is is reasonably to assume that if we do nothing to stop climate change, the planet will gradually change over to a climate like that in the Eocene. Ocean levels would be 300 feet higher and most of the equatorial regions would be uninhabitable due to extreme temperatures. However, that\u2019s not quite the worst of it, because during the decades-to-centuries of transition, plants and animals would be subject to varying levels of environmental stress, particularly by invasive species that are better able to adapt. In short, it would be a very different world, and due to this disruption, in many ways a lessened if not ruined world (assuming civilization is able to cope with the political and economic upheavals). Think about some of the wonderful things about this world, such as coral reefs and redwood forests (immobile species with long maturing times would be most vulnerable) and having them only exist on video. While you would be long dead when this occurs, it is something that future generations will be forced to contend with due to our inaction. ",

Last ice age most of what we now call Canada & USA were under (like) several kilometres of ice. Warm periods ( like the one we are in now) seem to be be (relatively) pretty harmless , in fact , more productive & much kinder to human existence.
