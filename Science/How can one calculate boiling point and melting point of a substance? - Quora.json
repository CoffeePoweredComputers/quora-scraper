            "answer_text": "Melting and Boiling points of elements ARE empirical.. as noted by the other responders. They are observed only, but your question says \u201csubstances\u201d, so I am wont to tell you about my favorite college eureka moment. Please bear with me. I was in a one hour Computing for Chemistry class, a requirement for us chemistry majors. I could do this class blindfolded, I had already been programming for years. I was the first one finished with our longest assignment where we had to use this new and unheard of program called MOPAC 1.0\u2026 to select 2 or three (non hydrogen) atoms to build into a covalently bonded molecule, then calculate .. all available energies at each temperature from Zero Kelvin to ( 400 F). When finished, the bifold printout was more than ten feet long. I had limited idea of what we were doing\u2026 and even though I had a poor rapport with Professer Zandler, I took my printout up to him to ask the point of the assignment. I wasn\u2019t just surprised to learn that from mostly electron (balistic) energies alone, we had just used a computer program to calculate the melting and boiling temperatures of my chosen molecule .. ethanol. (I was brewing beer much younger than that age, so I thought knew a bit about ethanol). This was the beginning of my understanding, as a budding materials scientist, that \u201cMaterials by Design\u201d, was going to become \u201ca thing\u201d in my lifetime. What an incredible discovery for me! I do not know much about how these programs work, but they are still available for download. I do remember a LOT of P Chem was learning about electron energies. I could not pass those tests today. I went on to become a well regarded spectroscopist, running IR, IR Microscope, Electron Microscope (4 kinds if..) as well as Mass Spec and many other outsourced analysis for Boeing Wichita. So I never left computational chemistry far behind. Yes, you CAN calculate melt and boiling points for some \u201csubstances\u201d. I did it way back in 1985. Either learn how these programs work, or .. download and use one. (Btw, you can still spend most of your career as \u201cComputational Chemist\u201d if that trips your trigger. ) Thanks for the question. Keep on asking! ",
