The preserved penis, about an inch long, has been described variously as a tendon, a piece of leather, a grape, and a shriveled sea horse. In 1977, an urologist living in New Jersey purchased the famous Napoleon\u2019s penis for $3,000 and stored it under his bed until he died 30 years later. His daughter inherited Napoleon\u2019s penis and has fielded at least one $100,000 offer.[4] 6. The bullet bra, Sweater girls of 40s,50s.  Credit: Dianna Prince YouTube.
