            "answer_text": "A p value can be looked at simply as the probability of getting the result being tested if the current belief in the model parameters (the Null Hypothesis) is correct. In this case it is extremely unlikely that the Null Hypothesis is correct. It is usual to talk about a result being significant at some level, often 0.05, 0.025 or 0.01 etc, so yes this result could be referred to as statistically significant, or, more usually, significant at the 0.001 (say) level.
