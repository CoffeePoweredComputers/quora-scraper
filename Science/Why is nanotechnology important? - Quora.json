            "answer_text": "Nanotechnology, despite its societal and scientific usefulness, is still very opague to the general public, and even those outside of scientific disciplines that actively employ these concepts.  There are two general technological routes:  the first being top-down and the other, more recent one, being bottom-up.  The electronics industry, for example, uses the former, while the self-assembly concept, where you can throw chemicals into a beaker and turn out electronics devices, helped drive enthusiasm for the latter.  Their resulting applications are changing the world around us in significant ways, which is why their technological application, in the form of nanotechnology, is profound. The top-down approach adapts traditional methods to nanotechnology. An important example are transistors, which are used, among other applications, in computers to make the \"0s\" and \"1s\" that make everything you do on a computer possible (of course, other important technologies are also involved, some of which also benefit from nanotechnology).  For decades, transistors used \"scaling laws\" to guide miniaturization while offering similar or superior performance.  Transistors are small enough now, that these \"laws\" do not apply.  Imagine that you drive your car every day and it operates the same way.  Then, one day you go to drive your car and it flies instead of driving along the road!  Because technology follows profoundly different rules, such as quantum mechanics, a discipline based around a size-regime was born.  Nano refers to 10^-9, and despite its name, an iPod(C) Nano(R) is NOT nano-sized. In terms of distance, where meters are used in science, a nanometer is 10^-9 meters or a billionth of a meter.  To place this in context, \"nano-effects\" are most profound generally below 10 nm in size, which is similar to the size of a virus, and represents only a few atoms.  More generally, structures under 100 nanometers in a particular dimension are referred to as nano, while some people loosely use this term for even larger structures.  Because this term is based upon a size, it can be implemented in diverse applications.  The electronics industry (and academic researchers) continue to explore new approaches to integrate these very different physical principles into devices to continue, as best they can, Moore's Law, or the approximate doubling of transistors in the same unit area every 18 months.  If Moore's law slows down too much, you will feel that computers aren't speeding up as much as you are used too.  In fact, you may feel that computer speed is \"slowing down.\"  Nanotechnology is very important in many electronics applications that we use everyday. The bottom-down approach exploits nanoscale phenomenon to produce, for example, artificial tissues to replace human tissue.  There are, of course, many other applications.  The basic idea here is to control the position and type of atoms in, typically, a solution, and how they interact to produce the desired structure and properties.  This is a very general way of saying that \"throwing in\" specific ingredients can give me a material that can do what I want.  I am less familiar with these applications, but I speculate that such concepts may be important for producing stabile \"inks\" for biomedical 3D printing, which is used to print human organs (instead of searching for donors).  This technology is still under development, and it will be years before it impacts our society by potentially providing longer average lifetimes.   The significance of nanoscale science and nanotechnology has resulted in the appearance of academic centers and programs related to these topics.  Some of which are industry oriented, such as testing novel composites for the aerospace industry or even helping the textile industry spotting imperfections much too small for a microscope (but are detrimental to the product).  Most people in the general public may never become aware of the significance of nanotechnology in their daily life, or future advances, which could include more efficient drug delivery (i.e. the pills you take have a greater effect).  That is ok.  But nanoscience and nanotechnology is becoming more and more intertwined with our everyday lives.  It is therefore worth appreciating and investigating further, because as we age, these concepts WILL play a greater effect in our the human condition, potentially from water filtering to our medical treatments.

            "answer_text": "Here I explained the importance of the nano technology and to know more visit this article. The importance of nanotechnology Nanotechnology is so important because it could have the potential to solve many of humanity's problems.  If developed responsibly, nanotechnology could solve problems in the poorest countries of the world as important as diseases, hunger, lack of drinking water and lack of houses. If developed in a non-responsible way, nanotechnology could be very dangerous, allowing the manufacture of very small weapons with an unimaginable force of destruction. Some experts believe that its impact on our life will be as important as in its day was the impact of medicine or the impact of computers. With the help of nanotechnology, the following benefits can be achieved: Manufacture new materials such as clothing that changes color , new adhesives , new self-cleaning construction materials, robots with the ability to \"see\" and \"feel\" ....New information technologies, such as quantum computing and microchips capable of storing trillions of bytes of information in a device as small as the tip of a pinMedical advances, including the administration of medicines and the detection and treatment of diseases such as cancer. With nanotechnology it will be possible to build small \"blood vessels\" that transport medicines directly to the tumor of a cancer to destroy itBenefits for the environment such as water purification, systems to control pollution, new sources of sustainable and clean energy, etc.",
