            "answer_text": "The basic understanding is that a molecule is polar if its central atom has lone electron pairs (electron pairs that aren't bonding). So if the molecule in question has/doesn\u2019t have that, then bam! You have your answer. Electronegativity is more of an additional criteria you can use, not something that takes precedence. However, there is a convention where the difference in electronegativity between two atoms in a molecule can be used to determine the type of bond between them, and in turn the molecule's polarity (for example a difference of 3 or more on the Pauling scale is usually an ionic bond, a difference between 1.2 and 3 is a polar covalent bond, and anything less than 1.2 is non-polar covalent). This is only a generalization and there are some exceptions to the rule. This electronegativity difference is usually taken into consideration when you're comparing the polarities of two or mo molecules. Here's an example case: \u201cBetween HF and HCl, which is more polar?\u201d You can use the periodic system of elements to determine whether the electronegativity difference of one molecule is bigger than another, thus knowing which molecule is more polar than the other (in this case, it's HF). Electronegativity difference can also determine which of 2 or more molecules is more polar / less polar than the others if all molecules have the same amount of lone electron pairs. For example: \u201cIs arsane more polar than ammonia?\u201d Since both have 1 lone pair each on their respective central atoms, we need to look at their electronegativity difference. I'll let you figure this one out on your own, but I hope you get the point. ",
