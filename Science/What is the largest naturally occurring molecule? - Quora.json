            "answer_text": "DNA. In nature as well as synthesized, the largest molecules are polymers. In cells, some protein molecules consist of 16000 monomers for a total of roughly 160000 atoms (beta galactosidase). But this is dwarfed by the size of the first and largest chromosome in our DNA, which is 247 million base pairs or roughly 15 billion atoms split over the two molecules in the double helix. Since DNA is different for every organism there are even larger ones. In wheat, there is one of almost a billion base pairs. See: Chromosome 1 (human) ",
