            "answer_text": "It\u2019s nothing unique to black holes. It\u2019s just due to the divergence of the gravitational field of a spherical object. If the Moon were much closer to the Earth it would be spaghettified by the Earth\u2019s gravitational field. It\u2019s just the extreme case of tidal forces. If the Moon were very close to the Earth the gravitational acceleration on the side next to the Earth would be greater than on the side of the Moon farthest from the Earth. So the Moon would be pulled apart. For objects, like the Moon, that are only held together by gravity, the distance within which they will be pulled apart is called the Roche limit after the French astronomer who first pointed this out: Roche limit - Wikipedia The only thing different about black holes is that you can get so close to them that the gravitational field divergence can tear apart things that are held together by atomic and stronger forces. But stars are only held together by gravity, so this difference isn\u2019t relevant to them. ",

            "answer_text": "Stars typically wouldn't be spaghettied. They are too large for that and are not solid objects. If they get too close the outer layers will be siphoned off and will spiral into the black hole as an accretion disk, while the rest of the star is largely unaffected.  (Courtesy: National Science Foundation) They might be spaghettified if they fell into a supermassive black hole, although not being solid objects they would break up rather than form anything like spaghetti.
