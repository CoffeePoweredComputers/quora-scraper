            "answer_text": "For time travel to be possible, it must be necessarily true that past, present, and future are all already \u2018authored\u2019 and in some sense \u2018happening\u2019. It is interesting that you ask if anyone in _history_ has done it. It is far more likely that someone from the future has done it. If time travel is physically possible, requiring just a human to discover the method for doing it, then time travel becomes ever more likely the further into the future one goes. And it is binary whether they _actually_ eventually invent it or not. That means there is a 50% chance that the future contains time travellers, and since all of the future has \u2018already happened\u2019, there\u2019s a good chance that time travellers from the future are in our present, right now!

            "answer_text": "unless somehow done by magical means, i doubt it could occur outside of a quantum scale. it\u2019s said that tachyons appear to move backwards in time. plus, if you traveled in time, wouldn\u2019t you be introducing mass to an already completed, perhaps closed state?? IE: the universe. if point:A is the past. and point:B is the present, and we traveled back in time, the particles that make-up \u2018us\u2019 would already exist in other forms of congruence. i mean, if the law of conservation is valid, there\u2019s never been any new matter or energy produced. so if the universe has always been \u2018mass-completed\u2019 from the beginning, but just rearranging it\u2019s particles into different forms(PLANETS/RADIATION/SUNS/GALAXIES etc.) then it could be like introducing gas into a balloon that\u2019s always filled to capacity. \u2018POP!!\u2019 ",
