            "answer_text": "Optimism. Science carries a very bleak message that people cannot cope with hearing. You only have to read a few pages of Quora to run into questions about immortality. Why are we waiting? Will it be possible How soon? And the conspiracy theories: Why is Big Pharma withholding the secret? Are they reserving eternal youth for the Illuminati? Etc. Science can only say, \u201cSorry, not possible. The Laws of thermodynamics that make life possible also prevent it being permanent\u201d. Indeed I do repeat that answer to those Quora questions. Way back in prehistory, as humans became sentient, at least some of our ancestors must have realised that & from that day to this we\u2019ve had 3 ways of dealing with it: Get depressed, carry on regardless or choose to disbelieve it. In prehistoric time is you became depressed & inert you either starved to death or became wolf-fodder, so those who couldn\u2019t cope with it tended to die out. Today\u2019s population derived from those who realised that true immortality lies in having a family that can endure indefinitely,and from those with an innate ability to keep on hoping when there is no hope. Both mindsets require genetically hardwired capacity for optimism, it enables people to achieve what doesn\u2019t look possible but is: If you try you might succeed & if you don\u2019t you can\u2019t. That strength unfortunately carries an equal & opposite vulnerability: Incitement to aggression, and that in turn links to our ancestral urge to seek dominance. There is no more dangerous animal than a parent protecting its young, & humans are no exception. We will defend our families to the death, & sadly there are many power-seekers who exploit this tendency to make us fight their enemies for them by presenting them as a threat to us. Then there are those those claiming to have solutions to mortality: Buy this amulet. Worship this stone. Turn to God. Believe in Jesus. Follow Muhammad. Eat this herb. Sacrifice this beast, this virgin, this child. Kill the unbelievers. To those who pin their optimism on mystic beliefs, the creed is even more precious than children. Aggression not only serves to defend the creed but the immortal soul. History is replete with power-seeking clerics who have abused this to urge previously benign congregations into mindless mobs intent on holy war, purges, genocides. Optimism ain\u2019t what it used to be. Armed with the technology to keep the planet habitable indefinitely we look on every solution as a problem, since each one challenges someone\u2019s treasured belief or status, and the phenomenon is being milked to the extreme by vested interests. Rather than be optimistic that we can control climate change, we are urged - by politicians whose careers are funded by oil money - to be optimistic that there is no problem, despite the storms & wildfires visible from our windows. We should be optimistic that we can halt population growth, but are urged by zillionaire online shopping magnates to believe that our already hurting planet can accommodate.20 billion people. What was once a wise motivation has become a gullible folly. ",

            "answer_text": "Progress in science generally improves things and doesn't rile people, but because technology has managed to heavily permeate consumer goods, we're not only more aware of it but we're also more aware of how little we understand it. This in turn has led to a growing unease or dissatisfaction with those who do, technocratic \"elites\" who gain ever-increasing power, wealth, control, and whose monopolies and crimes are seemingly unstoppable. It sets the stage for conspiracy theories to flourish, movements like Flat Earth, and even a general conservative tendency to elect those promising to return things \"back to normal\" or \"back to the good old days.\" And now with more substantial progress on AI, robotics, quantum computing, deepfakes, surveillance, etc. fears of the Singularity or social breakdown can manifest. The rate of change is also increasing, distressing even tech-savvy older people. New students wonder how to plan careers, choose courses, and even if there will be anything meaningful to do. ",
