            "answer_text": "There was no temperature even after the big bang. In order for heat transfer to take place, photons are required to exist in the first place. Standard big bang theory does not have quantum gravity theory. According to following quantum gravity theory, photons cannot exist prior to 10^{-26} sec. after the big bang. This is when electromagnetic force separate from the electroweak force and photons come into existence. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262492889_Periodic_quantum_gravity_and_cosmology Can electroweak force transfer heat? We know that the electromagnetic force can transfer heat and make the temperatures go up and down. Entire thermodynamics is based on this heat transfer. But the question is whether the electroweak force by itself can do the same thing? Can the electroweak force transfer heat in the total absence of electromagnetic radiation? There is no experimental evidence to support this idea. The spontaneous symmetry breaking causes the massless W3 and B bosons to coalesce together into two different bosons \u2013 the Zo boson, and the photon. Before this symmetry breaking, photons did not have any independent existence at all. What existed before this symmetry breaking were W bosons of weak isospin from SU(2) (W1, W2, and W3), and the B boson of weak hypercharge from U(1), respectively, all of which are massless. Are any of these particles capable of transfering heat? Answer is no. I think prior to symmetry breaking, following energy temperature formula which is based on Boltzmann constant cannot be used, because photons did not exist and this formula is applicable only to photons. T (deg.K) = E (in eV) x 11604.44845 So the question is whether there was any heat transfer in the early universe prior to separation of electromagnetic force from the electroweak force? If there was no heat transfer prior to separation of electromagnetic force then the universe had a beginning which was neither hot nor cold, and what is normally considered a reheating phase after inflation in standard model can be identified with electroweak symmetry breaking. But prior to this epoch, one cannot talk about heat transfer or entropy. Prior to separation of electromagnetic force from the electroweak force, absorption and emission of energy by particles did not involve heat transfer or change in temperature. This kind of energy exchange can be explained by a simple example. If you have a drum which is half filled with petrol (gasoline) and you add another half drum full of petrol to it, then the total energy in the drum is double but there is no heat transfer or change in temperature and this energy remains in a very compact form. This is consistent with the fact that as we go toward the Planck epoch, the size of the universe is very compact. If photon alone is the deciding factor for transfer of heat, then prior to existence of photon in the early universe, we cannot say that universe was hot or cold. Because in the absence of heat-transfer the word Cool loses its meaning. This is because, hot and cold are relative terms. In the absence of one the other has no meaning. You cannot generate gamma ray photon parameters in periodic quantum gravity theory (PQG) prior to 10^{-26} sec. after big bang. This is when the electromagnetic force separates from the electroweak force. (In standard model this occures at 10^{-12} sec.). My conclusion is that heat transfer cannot take place prior to this time, because you must have photon for transmitting heat. Other particles do not have this ability. Boltzman constant is based on photon and cannot be applied to other forms of energy. Idea of temperatue is associated with the increased volume of the heat absorbing body. So when the volume of mercury rise in a thermometer, we say the temperature has gone up. This happens when the electrons of the mercury atom absorb or eject photon. So the heat transfer and temperature are phenomenon associated with the interaction between electron and photon. In the absence of these particles talking about heat transfer and temperature is meaningless. ",

            "answer_text": "No. If one considers the Singularity and the crushing forces of pressure and the extreme temperatures of the Singularity, it was the hottest thing ever in the Universe. However, as the Singularity exploded and started moving, it creates a new Space/Time. That new Space/Time had absolutely \u201cNO\u201d TEMPERATURE. Space/Time only started acquiring \u201cany\u201d temperature when the Singularity shattered out into the new Space/Time and heat dissipated from the particles accelerating into the Space/Time. The overall temperature of the Universe is somewhere around -430 degrees Kelvin with fluxuations in temperature, uneven heating, but that is \u201cafter\u201d vigitillions of particles cooled in the new Space/Time, many billions of supernovas, quasars, and many other explosions where the dissipating of their heat radiating into the Universe had already taken place. Although absolute zero Kelvin is accepted as the temperature of the Universe, that is different than a Space/Time that has \u201cno\u201d heat or temperature to begin with. Just saying\u2026\u2026 ",
