            "answer_text": "There is a basic set of  methods that have been commonly used by historians  for a couple of centuries now : study primary sources, read secondary literature (works from other historians), establish new facts or give new interpretations. This is what Tim O'Neill described accurately. However, the same sources and the same facts can be interpreted in many different ways. This is something people can ignore if they're not accustomed to serious historical writings, and this is why this question is relevant. Let me illustrate that with one example (very much simplified, almost caricatural, and perhaps biased with a French point of view).  Let's say we are working on a medieval cartulary, that is a book with copies of charters (deeds) recording the transactions of properties within a given territory (say the land of a middle-ranked lord).  In the 19th century, historians would have focused their attention on trying to detect forgeries (fake charters written to claim the property of some land), and they would have used this cartulary to explain why this lord decided to side with such or such party in a conflict.In the 1920s-1930s, historians grew increasingly interested in economic and social history. They would have used this cartulary to study how the land was cultivated and how the rural economy worked.Marxists historian of the 1960s-1970s would go further and analyze the relationship between the lords and the peasant class, trying to establish numerical trends regarding production, income and taxation. (By the way, Steven Dillard, quantitative history (marxist or not) was much more fashionable in that time than nowadays, even if it is much easier to practice it today, with modern computing.) In the 1980s-90s, historians were influenced by other social sciences like anthropology, and you would have focused on the exchange of properties within a community, trying to explain it in the light of mariage strategies, for example.Nowadays, a lot of historians would wonder why this cartulary was made up in the first place, and give a closer look at the manuscript itself . How was it written? Was it a necessary tool for the management of the estate, or did it serve the political authority of the lord, or the memory of his family?This last approach (the documentary turn) seems to me to be the biggest trend among current historians, but that doesn't mean that they all follow it. Depending on your sources, your interests, your influences, you can use one or several of such methods, as long as you use the primary sources properly. Thanks for reading my Historiography for Dummies. ",

            "answer_text": "What the questioner linked to in the Wiki entry on this subject were not actually \"several different historical methods\".  They were simply different ways of expressing how the standard process of historical analysis and synthesis works.  I have summarised this process elsewhere as follows: Early historians like Herodotus established the beginnings of the  methods used by modern historical researchers, though historians only  began to develop a systematic methodology based on agreed principles  from the later eighteenth century onwards, using the techniques of Barthold Niebuhr(1776-1831) and Leopold von Ranke (1795-1886).The Historical Method is based on three fundamental steps, each of which has its own techniques: 1. Heuristic - This is the identification of relevant material  to use as sources of information.  These can range from the obvious,  such as a historian of the time's account, who records events he  witnessed personally, to the much less obvious, like a medieval manor's  account book detailing purchases for the estate.  Everything from  archaeological finds to coins to heraldry can be relevant here.  The key  word here is \"relevant\", and there is a high degree of skill in working out which sources of information are pertinent to the subject in question. 2. Criticism - This is the process of appraising the source  material in light of the question being answered or subject being  examined.  It involves such things as determining the level of  \"authenticity\" of a source (Is it what is seems to be?), its \"integrity\"  (Can its account be trusted?  What are its biases?), its context (What  genre is it?  Is it responding or reacting to another source?  Is it  using literary tropes that need to be treated with  skepticism?)  Material evidence, such as archaeology, architecture, art ,  coins, etc. needs to be firmly put into context to be  understood.  Documentary sources also need careful contextualization -  the social conditions of their production, their polemical intent (if  any), their reason for production (more important for a political speech  than a birth certificate, for example) , their intended audience and  the background and biases of their writer (if known) all have to be  taken into account. 3. Synthesis and Exposition - This is the formal statement of  the findings from steps 1 and 2, which each find support by reference to  the relevant evidence. The main difference between this method and those used in the hard  sciences is that the researcher lays all this material, its analysis,  and his conclusions out systematically, but the conclusions are a  subjective assessment of likelihood rather than an objective statement  of probabilistic induction.  This subjectivity is what many trained in  the sciences find alien about history and lead them to reject history as  insubstantial. But the key thing to understand here is that the historian is not  working toward an absolute statement about what definitely happened in  the past, since that is generally impossible except on trivial points  (e.g., there is no doubt that Adolf HItler was born on April 20,  1889).  A historian instead works to present what is called \"the argument to the best explanation\".  In  other words, the argument that best accounts for the largest amount of  relevant evidence with the least number of suppositions.  This means  that the Principle of Parsimony, also known as Occam's Razor, is a key  tool in historical analysis; historians always favor the most  parsimonious interpretation that takes account of the most available  evidence. There are differing theoretical perspectives on how a heuristic regarding what source material is relevant is to be applied, how \"relevance\" is determined, how much weight different types of evidence should be given, the assumptions underlying any kind of critical analysis and how objective or otherwise any synthesis can be.  But all systematic analysis of the past tends to be broadly made up of these three stages. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know what the most common method is, but I do know that there is increasing pressure to use quantitative methods. I know this because when I was consulting to professors in a history department, a couple of the younger professors told me this was happening.  I think that quantitative methods are used more often for more recent historical analysis, where it is still possible to talk to the people involved in the events you are studying, or to gather secondary evidence, such as from the census or any other data set that might be relevant.  Historians might use account books or other publications from an era, and digitize them and start counting various types of entries or pictures or whatever. There are probably an infinite number of ways of using old texts and artifacts to support analyses that were not possible even a few years ago. As far as I can tell, quantitative history is the hot topic in many history departments, and more and more PhD students are using these techniques. It may not be the most common method now -- and indeed, may never be the most common method, but I bet it will become a lot more common. ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to add in re-creation as a historical discipline that further deepens our understanding of topics.This can be a simple testing of facts, such as reading 7 pillars of wisdom and re-creating Lawrence's camel ride from Aqaba to Cairo to see if it is possible. Camels today are no slower than they were during WW1. How many men can you fit into the pass of Thermopylae? How much land did an ancient city need to feed the people etc etc. It can be reconstruction of objects, Tim Severin's boats, Thor Heyerdahl's voyages, attempting to reconstruct a trebuchet, or a trireme or a medieval castle wall. Practical archaeology can demonstrate truths we initially missed in the documentary sources. It can be an understanding of why people did certain things. Did Roman legionnaires drink posca as a way to use up soured wine supplies, or were there health benefits? Sometimes the best place to start is to make posca and drink it. 10 minutes with an expert horseman like Mike Loades can clarify why some cavalry fight in a different way to others. Why a cavalry camp is different to an infantry camp. What to look for in the archaeology when we dig. How to interpret what we find etc. ",

The purpose of blackening the names of our ancestors is to teach us that these things are evil and we should avoid them. As the past is a mystery there is no point in looking at the context and values of the day in order to understand what they did and why. That's too hard and pointless anyway as it is no use today. Chairman Mao guided their thinking when he said \"Let the past serve the present\". Use history to teach us to be better citizens. To abhor racism, gender bias, homophobia, capitalism, nationalism, fascism, nazism, libertarianism, liberalism and so on.  No other form of history may be taught. ",
