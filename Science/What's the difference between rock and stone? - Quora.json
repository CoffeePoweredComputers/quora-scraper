Rock(er): You love all kinds of rock music Human biology You can\u2019t have kidney rocks. Motions You can \u2018rock\u2019 back and forth, which is similar to the motion a pendulum makes, only upside down. Stoning is either the medieval and BC practice of throwing stones at people in order to kill them (normally as punishment for breaking the law) or it is getting high on marijuana. WWE Stone: Stone Cold Steve Austin Rock: Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson Geology Stones tend to be of a certain size, something you can hold in your hand but that isn\u2019t too big to throw. They also tend to be a specific shape, like a disc, sphere, or cube. Essentially they are a sort of \u201cideal\u201d rock. (This is not a scientific definition because \u2018stone\u2019 is not a scientific term. Also, you can have stones that are too large to throw but those are always referred to as \u201clarge stones\u201d or \u201chuge stones\u201d) Rocks on the other hand range from microscopic fragments to huge \u2018rocks\u2019 like the famous Uluru in australia:  Rocks also tend to be made up of many different minerals, where as stones might be made up of only one mineral, like \u2018precious stones\u2019 such as ruby and sapphire (although fun fact: rubies are actually still sapphires, they just have a red color). Neither of them are ever just one element, except in the case of the \u2018precious stone\u2019 of diamond, which is pure carbon. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no practical difference between a rock and a stone. Different words for the same thing - something English is very good at. Usually we would use \u2018rock\u2019 for any random rock - bedrock, river rock, rock wall - and use \u2018stone\u2019 for rocks people have taken to use, and SHAPED - like \u2018stone edging\u2019 or \u2018cobble stones\u2019 or something like that. So a \u2018rock wall\u2019 would be made of rocks people picked up and stacked, and a \u2018stone wall\u2019 would be made of rocks people had picked up and knocked the edges off a bit to shape them and THEN stacked. But that\u2019s getting pretty picky, and it isn\u2019t like anybody polices the use of the terms \u2018rock\u2019 and \u2018stone\u2019. Feel free to use them interchangeably. Still - a rock is something sitting on the ground. But if you pick up that same rock and throw it at somebody, it\u2019s a stone. ",

Igneous rock forms from the melting of magma but limestone forms from precipitation of CaCO3 from water and the evaporation of water. Stone in general usually refers to a building material that can be used to build something but rock is usually a more general term and describes something hard that may or may not be used to build something. The difference between the two terms is based more upon how they were originally named or used rather than the material they are made of. ",

On the basis of size, a stone is much smaller than a rock. In simpler terms, it means that rock is made out of stone and mineral matter. The stone is used for construction is cut out of ricks; rocks are mainly found on the earth's crust and is found on the surface of the earth.
