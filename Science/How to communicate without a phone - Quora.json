If the world has not mobile phone any more, people have a lot of ways to communicate together, I think. We can write a letter that is so easy and cheap to send. Another way to get in touch with others people is requested to meet around town at your favorite locations. I guess you will feel relaxing to talk and enjoy the atmosphere. Finally, you can connect to the others by using your computer which has many apps like video chat or snap chat. Life would be better without mobile phone. ",

Letters are quite easy and cheap to send, and it\u2019s always nice to receive something in the mail. Alternatively, you could both use an e-mail account to exchange e-mails. They\u2019re faster than hand-written letters and free, and your provider stores e-mails forever (for the most part). You could also request to meet around town at your favorite locations, and spend a free afternoon just talking and enjoying the atmosphere. If you\u2019re in school, find some time between classes to say hi, or take some time out right after to catch up. Perhaps you can invite him over, or visit him at his home to chat over a cup of tea, or go for a walk and talk. Beyond that, I cannot really think of much else with such little details provided, but I hope that my answer provides some insightful ideas! ",
