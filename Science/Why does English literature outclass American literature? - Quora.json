            "answer_text": "To say that English literature \u2018outclasses\u2019 American literature is a very sweeping statement as well as a rather provocative one. English literature has a greater depth of history to draw on than American. America (the USA) is a comparatively young country and whilst people were recording events and writing stories from its inception the fledgling country\u2019s focus was clearly not on building a reputation for literary output! This notwithstanding there is a body of work dating back to the 17th century. The great figures of American literature easily stand comparison with their British counterparts (and are widely read by British readers). Hemingway, Twain, Faulkner, Whitman are all top flight authors. Steinbeck is often considered a second stringer but personally I like him more than most of the front rank. (Can a Nobel laureate be considered second rate?) Fielding, Fenimore Cooper, Edgar Allan Poe and Washington Irvine all made a contribution, along with others too numerous to list. More recently John Updike (who I like) and Norman Mailer (who I don\u2019t) and others took on the mantle, accompanied by writers of more diverse cultural backgrounds. Before the twentieth century the US may not have had the strength-in-depth that English literature had but in more recent times the Johnny-come-lately has made up a lo of lost ground. There may be no Chaucer, no Shakespeare or Milton nor even a Dickens (but Dickens was really writing for Television and film, he just didn't know it!). Nonetheless the stock of American literature is riding pretty high based on the reputations of those it has produced. ",
