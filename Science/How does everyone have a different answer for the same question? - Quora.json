            "answer_text": "If you can believe it, no two people out of all the billions of people on Earth have the same opinion. Each one truly sees differently than the other, even if they sound similar, in some way they are different. Egoism is a force that separates us and makes us feel different from everybody else, even if we share the same culture, etc. I wouldn\u2019t feel myself alive if I didn\u2019t feel different in some way! This is most evident in our thoughts and views on just about anything, be it political, social, scientific, or economical topics, a person must put a twist on his answer somehow in order to feel different and superior toward others. They may agree on a certain thing, but not \u201con the whole.\u201d They will always deviate somewhere within their agreement. This is man\u2019s nature! So no matter the topic or question, if you ask ten people the same thing, you will get ten different responses. ",

I like informal writing, and was chastised by someone named David, for using the word \u201cokay\u201d. Since it was a question I wrote, I might just delete it, and take away all his upvotes on that answer. Hah! There are positive opinions, and negative opinions. Certain people like to relay answers borne of personal experience, like myself. Others appear to be derivative drivel. Not like me. And some sound like they were copied straight out of an encyclopedia. Still others will cite a hypothetical experience. Different takes on the same subject could explain the variations. There will always be the ones who insist on the one-word answer, the rebels, and a few who just didn\u2019t understand the question. Different people, different answers. ",
