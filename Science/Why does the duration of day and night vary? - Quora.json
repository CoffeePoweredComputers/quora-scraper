            "answer_text": "It is because of rotation of earth around\u2026earth is not rotation around sun on equal plane..it is tilted by few angles\u2026so we can see one point of time earth is above sun equitorial plane and then below sun equitorial plane\u2026 If the earth is above sun equitorial plane\u2026southen hemisphere of earth will experience summer( long day,less night).it is usually from Oct to Dec. If the earth is below sun equitorial plane\u2026Northern hemisphere of will experience summer. It is usually from April to june. There are two point in which earth equitorial plane and sun equitorial plane on the same line\u2026it is called equinox.. it on this day..we get equal day and night..it happens on March 21\u201324 and sept 21\u201324. So, change of season/ day time and night time , everything is due to rotation of earth around sun.. ",

            "answer_text": "The earth is tilted in its rotational axis by 23 degrees from the plane of it\u2019s orbit around the sun. If you stood on the north pole at the summer, you would see the sun remain in the sky 24 hours a day. As you approached the equator, the length of days in the summer would approach 12 hours or half a 24 hour period. As you continue south to the south pole, the days will get shorter and eventually the sun would be below the horizon 24 hours a day. Six months later as the earth is on the oppose side of it\u2019s orbit around the sun, the tilt will have the north pole facing away form the sun and the opposite phenomena on day lengths will be observed.
