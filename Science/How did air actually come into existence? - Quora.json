            "answer_text": "Air is a mixture of gasses and, luckily for us, it is a pretty stable mixture. Our planet started out so hot that it wasn't even solid. However, hydrogen and helium were extremely easy to find around here when the planets formed. Since hydrogen reacts very rapidly with oxygen, water is easily formed. In fact, there is an enormous amount of water out there in the cold depths of space. (And loads of alcohol, by the way.) The actual forming of the atmosphere is a long and complicated story. We already had hydrogen and helium in our earliest days, so much is pretty certain. Much of that early atmosphere escaped, though. When the volcanoes  set off, and boy did they!, they gave us water, in the form of steam, carbon dioxide and ammonia. All useful chemicals. The first forms of life used those chemicals but couldn't have dealt with oxygen. They actually excreted oxygen as a waste gas! They did that for a very long time and there were a lot of them, giving us an atmosphere with a slowly rising oxygen level.  Go to Atmosphere of Earth on Wikipedia and scroll down to Evolution of Earth's atmosphere for more information. ",
