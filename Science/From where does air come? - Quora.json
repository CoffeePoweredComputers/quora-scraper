            "answer_text": "During the Big Bang, various gases such as helium, oxygen, and others were together which were distributed to its parts when that big ball of heat broke up. Luckily our earth got a major part of the surviving gas oxygen. Carbon dioxide was a result of oxidation of carbon due to various reasons such as burning of carbon due to lightning bolts. Volcanic eruptions also gave put these gases which occurred very frequently in those times. This formed the base of the atmosphere. ",

            "answer_text": "Air is made ou of different gases like oxygen and nitrogen. We know that oxygen was created a sun that was at the place of our sun today. In the beginning there was a lot of carbon dioxide in atmosphere but it was turned to other gases as plants became a thing. But I don't know where the carbon dioxide came. Maybe from reaction so some sort. ",
