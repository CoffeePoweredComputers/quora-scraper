            "answer_text": "Because the properties of elements repeat periodically. Well, sort of periodically. The periods get longer as you move down the table. Several chemists tried to make tables of the elements before Mendeleev\u2019s periodic table, usually ordering elements by atomic mass (the concept of atomic number did not yet exist). Mendeleev also started by ordering the elements based on atomic mass, but he used the periodic repetition of elemental properties to do two very important things: he switched some elements close in mass so that they followed periodicity, resulting in a table organized by atomic number (but he didn\u2019t know that, he thought the measured masses were wrong); and he left gaps, hypothesizing that they would be filled by the discovery of new elements, including three that he called ekasilicon, ekaaluminium, and ekaboron. We know these elements as germanium, gallium, and scandium respectively, and his predictions of their properties were largely accurate. We now know that we organize the table by atomic number (the number of protons in a nucleus), and we see that properties still repeat periodically. However, the properties do change slightly down the table- the last element in any period is the least reactive in that period, but unlike the others oganesson is believed to be a solid and to be far more reactive than the noble gases above it. But the periodic repetition of properties is strong enough that it makes sense to call the table the periodic table. ",

            "answer_text": "As early as the 1800s, following the ferver of element discovery that engrossed the 1700s, chemists began figuring out the atomic weights of the elements. Some chemists noticed that the general physical and chemical properties of the elements repeated periodically. If they listed the elements in order of atomic mass, the general properties of the elements would repeat every 7th element. The second element (what we now call lithium) shared several similarities with the 9th element, sodium. Both were exceptionally soft, white metals that would rust over in a matter of seconds if exposed to air. Both reacted violently with water. And the 16th element, potassium, shared many of these qualities as well. The same was found of beryllium, magnesium and calcium. Fluorine, chlorine and bromine. Oxygen and sulfur. Look at your modern periodic table and notice that these groups of elements all happen to share the same column. A quite famous Russian chemist named Dimitri Mendeleev (Min-del-ay-ev) took this idea of periodicity, the repeating nature of the elements' properties, and used it to transform how the elements are presented. Rather than a simple list, he arranged them in rows that had similar properties. In doing so, he discovered two things: That the elements sometimes were NOT arranged in order of atomic mass, and that some elements were... missing. He proceeded to describe the expected properties of the \"missing\" elements, and when germanium was discovered by a French scientist less than 10 years later, he authored a paper in which he asserted that the other scientists' data was incorrect because it was inconsistent with his prediction. And further study led to the realization that Mendeleev was right! The french guy's data was wrong. Of course, Mendeleev's new table was not exactly the table we see today but it was close. For example, we now know that the elements' properties repeat every 8 elements thanks to the discovery of the entirely unreactive noble gases. We group the similar elements into columns instead of rows. Further, Mendeleev would never live to see the reason for the periodicity explained. It took another 30 years before the discovery valence electrons. Scientists discovered electrons in the late 1800s. By 1920, various experiments had led chemists to conclude that the electrons occupied a series of spherical orbits at fixed energy intervals. Further, they discovered that each shell can contain 8 electrons, and that the number of electrons in this shell matched the column that the element appeared in. That is to say, all the elements in the first column have 1 electron in their outermost shell. All the elements in the seventh column have 7 electrons in their outermost shell. And so, scientists finally found the reason for the periodicity of the elements: Valence electrons. And so the table became known as the Periodic Table. ",
