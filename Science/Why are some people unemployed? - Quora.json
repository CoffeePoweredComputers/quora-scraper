            "answer_text": "Maybe all of those things. Plus there will always be a small core of people who don't want a job, or have mental health issues or substance abuse issues. Mental health problems are a major reason why some people are not only unemployed, but also homeless. This is something that could happen to anyone anytime; most people who develop mental illnesses can be helped, but there are some who are very difficult to help. There are also many people who have a problem not severe enough to stop them functioning, but that makes it hard for them to get a job. Some people just can't face the 9 till 5. I'm guessing most unemployed people don't have any particular issues, but they get discouraged about finding work and the jobs they have the skills to do are not ones they especially feel like doing. Some people can learn new skills easily, but others feel like it's an impossible task. One thing schools could really do to help is to teach people how to set up their own businesses, whether online or in real life. A business isn't necessarily a huge undertaking where you draw up a business plan and find investors. It can just be a little thing where you engage in some kind of trade for cash. I don't think schools really teach this at all. Partly this must be because most teachers don't have the right kind of experience to pass on. Yet if you look at statistics, an awful lot of people actually work for themselves or for a family business. Some say schools are geared towards producing \"drones\" that work endlessly and unthinkingly for other people. I wonder if there isn't a grain of truth in that. Of course, not everyone comes out of school wanting to be a \"drone\", but they don't necessarily know what else to do. When you look at a typical school day, it consists basically in doing what you're told all day, learning stuff that often does not have an immediate practical application. This trains people to work in offices or factories, but doesn't train them to run their own business. This means that anyone who doesn't want to work for others, faces an immense psychological barrier in working for themselves. Nothing in school, probably not even business studies classes, prepares them for it. School trains us to be subservient, not to think for ourselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Apart from luck, recession, education system, less jobs in given sector, I would love to talk about reasons (or what?) why someone (blame oneself) is unemployed in two parts :at the interview, at job (get fired or leave) At the interview: Less or zero knowledge: One don\u2019t have the basics clear and so lacks in theoretical and practical knowledge. He/she either remain silent or answer irrelevent even when a simple question is asked by interviewer and then interviewer says \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you\u201d. We all know what it means when interviewer is pissed.You\u2019re unprepared: You didn\u2019t read the job description, you know nothing about the company or the industry.You\u2019re not networking enough: Almost all jobs these days are found through networking #referenceYou have ear(s) pierced (if you are male): Corporates need a marketing manager not a rockstar! #unprofessional @IndiaVisible Tattoo: Now, with start-up trend, we do have cool CEOs and managers who tolerate small size decent tattoo but traditional companies and every Government companies managers thinks tattoo is a symbol of unprofessionalism. #IndiaReason well for your excuse: Interviewer: You got a tattoo (Image below) What\u2019s written in chinese? Me: It\u2019s actually Mandarian and it means \u201cBelieve\u201d . I believe, one could achieve anything in this World.

Trim nostril hair, sharpen you nails. You didn\u2019t shave?You can\u2019t communicate wellYou are asking too much moneyYou are over-educated for a job: If you are engineering graduate (fresher) and sitting in interview for office assistant job, then interviewer would think you will leave this job when you get a job in your core field.You\u2019re overqualified: Someone will not hire four year experienced candidate for entry level job.Attitude stinks: Arrogant, Not positive, depressed, less confidence, frustrated, yack too much.Body posture & hand movements while talkingListening skills: Many would think, listening is easy. No, its not, one should be attentive, wave off those random thoughts (love, society, your dreams & problems). Interviewer asks you a question and you would say \u201cpardon\u201d or answer irrelevent as you didn\u2019t listen carefully because you are not focused and so can not analyse before you speak.You are evasive: If you are asked a question, answer it. Don\u2019t beat the bush.You don\u2019t love your field: For example, You studied architecture because your parents forced you to. You dont have the interest so you don\u2019t prepare well for interview. Life is short, do what you want!At job (get fired or leave) : You don\u2019t love your field: For example, You studied architecture because your parents forced you to. So, you dont want to work with dedication and at last your employer fires you or you are so ashamed that you leave the job and search for another.You dont like 9 to 5 jobYou dont like field job (sales)Less knowledge, low analytical and other skills required for the jobYou dont communicate well: Poor communication with boss and colleague leads to poor results.You are so dumb: You cant even understand what your boss tells you to do because you are not focused.Attitude stinks: Arrogant, Not positive, depressed, less confidence, frustrated, yack too much.You don\u2019t learn from your mistakes and keep doing same mistakes which piss off the employer.You are not punctual, you can\u2019t be trusted.You don\u2019t know how to handle office politics.You keep switching jobs: For example: In two years, you switched four jobs and you left the job, started searching again, now will the interviewer want someone like you?",
