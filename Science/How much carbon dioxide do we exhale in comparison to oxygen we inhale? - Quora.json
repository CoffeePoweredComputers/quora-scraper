            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. In a nutshell, factually in case of a normal adult at rest, As, volume of air we inhale and exhale per minute is about 8 litres. Indirectly about 8*60*24=11520 litres in a day.We generally have rate of respiration (for air) of about 20 cycles per minute.In air content as their is about 21% of O2 (we intake), So during exhalation O2 content is about 15% which means 6% of O2 is consumed.6% of air which is inhaled gets converted into CO2 and that percent of O2 is only utilised in body.Estimation, Volume of air during respiration is 11520 litres in a day. So, amount of O2 content in 11520 lt. of air is 11520*0.21=2419.2 lt. amount of CO2 content in 11520 lt. of air is 11520*0.0004=4.608 lt. As 5% of volume of air is consumed so, 11520*0.06=691.2 lt. of O2 in air is converted into CO2 and utilised in body. Therefore, 691.2 lt. of O2 out of 11520 lt. of air is consumed in a day. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on your diet. What you are asking is described as a respiratoy quotient. Respiratory quotient - Wikipedia determines the relative production of oxygen compared to carbon dioxide produced. This article gives the RQ\u2019s for consumption of various nutrients. In addition if you are gaining weight and coverting carbohydrates into fat your RQ will be strikingly below 1.0. ",
