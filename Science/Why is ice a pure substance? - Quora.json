            "answer_text": "It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be \u2018pure\u2019. However, I\u2019m guessing with this question you\u2019re not taking the potential for substances/pollutants to be present in the ice. Basically, without taking into account the potential for pollutants that are often found in water (pre-freezing), Ice is pure because it only contains one type of molecule, namely H2O. If you put ice in water, its just putting water in water, but in two different states. If you were to measure the total mass of water in a glass, and the mass of a couple of ice cubes, then add those ice cubes to that glass and wait for them to melt, technically the total mass of water you have before and after is the same (assuming no water evaporates in that time), because both ice (solid water) and the liquid water are solely composed of H2O.

            "answer_text": "Ice is not necessarily a pure substance. A single crystal of ice grows one molecule at a time fitting each one into place, not leaving room for impurities. The crystal growth excludes most would be impurities unless they happen to fit a space available. Salt ions are notable for being excluded, so freezing sea water tend to get more salty. Water is unusual in that the crystal structure makes it less dense than as a solid than as a liquid. Each water crystal needs an impurity to start the crystal, so even rain and snow are not quite pure. ",
