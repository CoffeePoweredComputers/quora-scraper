            "answer_text": "To answer this requires some assumptions. Making various assumptions I can argue why a, b, and d are each the most precise. Like, is that initial 0.005 really 0.0050? It could be, judging by the 0.0049 & 0.0051 grouped with it. Also, do you mean consistent when you say precise? So... A is the most precise, if these are measurements from some process, and it is the precision of the process you mean.B is the most precise if it's the number of significant digits, where 9.92 is more precise than 2.31 because it's correct to 1 in 992 rather than 1 in 231.D is the most precise, because measurements are to 12 significant digits (assuming that 2.29*10^12 and 2.3*10^2 come from the same linear measuring instrument) meaning that 2.29*10^12 is actually 2.290000000000*10^12.",

            "answer_text": "Usually, precision is stated as \u2018number of significant digits\u2019 not counting leading or trailing zeroes. Accuracy, however is a whole \u2018nuther thing. The engineers who designed the first moon rocked did most of their work to 3 or 4 significant digits precision and it mostly worked out for them. Though they had limited access to computers they worked most of their math using slide rules and 4 digit precision was the limit on those things. Consider that the machinery they used to make the precision parts for their rockets was limited to several tenthousands on an inch on larger parts and perhapse a single thousandth of an inch on smaller parts but was not always a repeatable level of accurately. Today, individual atoms and single molecules can be directly manipulated. With all that, most work can still be accomplished with a slide rule and get useable results. Still computer accuracy is limited to plus or minus one least significant bit at whatever scale one chooses to measure. ",
