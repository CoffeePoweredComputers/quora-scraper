            "answer_text": "According to the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory, the Universe is the hypersurface of a lightspeed expanding hypersphere. This is easier to understand if the same topology is restated with one less dimension: The Universe is the \u201csurface\u201d of a lightspeed expanding sphere - where the surface is actually tridimensional. How Big Was the Universe at time Zero HU takes the following initial approximation in the estimation of the initial size of the Universe. HU considers the current density of matter (2 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter) and the maximum density (according the HU) possible in the Universe. That density is not Infinite as people who blindly believes in an empirical Gravitational Law with a pole at zero distance. The empirical is important. Newton\u2019s Law is not a law that has been tested at infinitely small distances. There is absolutely no reason why this law would work at zero distance. HU derives from first principles the Law of Gravitation. The macroscopic version of it, resembles Newton\u2019s Law:  The microscopic law is based on the Quantum Lagrangian Principle. QLP is the Lagrangian Principle that states that the Fundamental Dilators will always dilate space in phase with the surrounding dilaton field. This results in a maximum density where the force goes to zero or becomes a Well. This is similar to asymptotic freedom and happens inside Black Holes. In Neutron Stars, the Fundamental Dilator can exist in its excited state (neutrons). They occupy a larger volume. If the star mass is higher, neutrons collapse, and the maximum density is achieved. That density is around 1E21[math] Kg/m^3[/math]. So if you know the current density, know the topology of the Universe, so it is easy to calculate the 4D radius at time zero. HU estimates it to be 121 light-seconds. So the Universe started already as a 121 light-seconds Black Hole. In reality, the Universe is the whole hyperspherical hypersurface. 121 light-seconds is the visible Universe horizon. To understand better HU Cosmogenesis, you have to understand that HU provides a model where Matter is made of coherence deformation of the local metric, that is, Matter is composed of polymers of a shapeshifting, spinning space deformation! Since the Universe is just the thin outermost layer (hypersurface), one should ask what was inside the hypersphere and what happened to it. The answer is that the hypersphere was a hyperspherical 2S-orbital-like metric deformation with dilated inner regions and compressed outer regions. What happened to it was the recombination of all layers but the outermost compression later and an equivalent dilation inner layer. Since they did not recombine, the outermost layer was placed in motion by the inner dilation layer. That explains the motion part of the lightspeed expanding hyperspherical universe. That motion could have been smooth, that is, the whole outermost layer being accelerated at the speed of light or not. Whatever happened, the nature of a dynamic Universe forces it to be sensitive only to itself. Imagine if there was a fraction of the outermost layer mass traveling faster than the speed of light radially. That part would be ahead of us and be invisible. The same would happen to anything left behind. Interaction through retarded potential only happens for elements within the hypersphere. No astronomical observation has been found (or recognized) to support a fragmented acceleration of the Universe. ##################################################### ##################################################### Below are accomplishments of HU challenging the cosmological ruler and the topology (4D Spacetime). The Cosmological Ruler is based on the assumption that all type 1a Supernova (SN1a) are equal (Stellar Candles). HU Law of Gravitation indicates that G is epoch-dependent. Since SN1a explosions take place when the mass of the White Dwarf reaches the Chandrasekhar Mass and that mass has a [math]G^{(-\\frac{3}{2})}[/math]. HU follows the SN1a epoch dependent hypothesis (which is supported by the derivation of a Law of Gravitation that passes all astronomical tests). That leads to the correction of the \u2018observed\u2019 distances of SN1a Supernovae. Once corrected, the independently derived and validated d(z) are applied to the SDSS BOSS dataset.  The resulting is astonishing. It shows hyperspherical acoustic waves imprinted on the Galaxy Density map of the Universe. This shots ANOTHER HOLE in General Relativity. GR is a 4D Spacetime. Hyperspherical Waves shows that we live in a 5D Dynamic Spacetime. GR has no relationship with reality and it is challenged by these astronomical observations ##################################################### As old Hermes used to say: \u201cGod is an infinite sphere, the center of which is everywhere, the circumference nowhere.\u201d ~ Hermes Trismegistus ##################################################### Let me explain Hermes Trismegistus better. The Hypergeometrical Universe Theory (HU) proposed that the Universe (the 3D Spatial coordinates) are the hypersurface on a lightspeed expanding hypersphere. Looking into the past can be understood by the following plot:  This is the XR cross-section of the hypersphere (think sphere, it makes life easier), where X can be any direction within our 3D Universe. So, you can see the center of the Universe. It is the smallest hypersphere possible (consistent with the current Universe mass density). In HU the Universe started as a 121 light-seconds 4D Radius hypersphere. Our 3D Universe was the outermost layer. So Universe doesn\u2019t have a center (within our 3D Space, I mean). It has a center, but that center lies 13.8 Billion light-years away (perpendicularly to our 3D space). On the other hand, due to symmetry, the Banging occurred all over the Universe (this is slightly incorrect, and I will explain better later). This is just to go along with Hermes Trismegistus\u2026:) The second part of the saying is easier to see. The circumference is nowhere to be seen. For you to see the circumference, you have to leave the hypersurface (to be able to see things along R). Hence, the circumference is nowhere to be found. The center of the sphere (hypersphere) remains static in a 4D Space. We move away from it at the speed of light. ##################################################### MORE ABOUT THE UNIVERSE Copernicus was Wrong\u2026:) We are at the center of an acoustic wave footprint that took place 13.8 billion years ago. We are very close to ONE of the centers of the acoustic waves that seeded our Universe. SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) Orange Pie plot gives you a hint of that.  In the top part of the figure above, one can see what seems to be waves. This is a flattened and unflattering (the Universe backside looks way too small) view of the Universe. Those features, which I call wave footprints (NAO or Neutronium Acoustic Oscillations), even have a name. SDSS call them - The Great Wall.:) Cosmologists parrot that and run away when offered evidence of Neutronium Acoustic Waves (Hyperspherical Waves). This flattened view is not evidence of anything. That said, it should have prompted efforts like mine from their part. ################################################### I had the unpleasant experience to be the victim of Dr. Kevin Schawinski (from ETH) bad manners. I asked him if he was aware of hyperspherical acoustic oscillation (acoustic oscillations along the DISTANCE DIMENSION). He just parroted that I was talking about the Great Wall.. It turns out that I wasn\u2019t talking about this stupid projection. Compare this projection with the map I created here. This is done with the same data and tells you a different totally story. Further evidence can be obtained from the cross-section of the Universe map using Celestial Coordinates in a direction perpendicular to the angular space. This is what you see when you go through that exercise. THE RECURRENCE WAS DUE TO A BIASED DATA COLLECTION PROTOCOL BY THE SDSS. THEY CALL IT CMASS AND CORRESPONDS TO ONLY COLLECTING DATA ON GALAXIES OF THE SAME MASS FOR ANY GIVEN REDSHIFT Z.

Huygens notice that his Pendulum Clocks would synchronize spontaneously, no matter the initial relative phase they were set in. Marco Pereira's answer to Does the Huygens' Pendulum Synchronicity support the Quantum Lagrangian Principle? It just happens that his Pendulum Conundrum has the same mechanism as the Fundamental Dilator Quantum Lagrangian Principle and that pervades the Whole Universe and is the reason for the Quantum Mechanics Nature of Matter and the reason for Natural Laws. I derived Natural Laws from it and the Lightspeed Expanding Hyperspherical Universe topology. ######################################################## SDSS had this data for 10 years, but their analysis has been constrained by Ideology. The Ideology that we live in a 4D Spacetime (Einstein) and that Copernicus was always right..:) Here is the map of the Universe created from our view of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Marco Pereira's answer to According to the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory (HU), where is our universe within the hyperspherical hypersurface? These are just the low-frequency components (k<49). In the future, a higher bandwidth map will be created. Using the spectral decomposition of the low-frequency CMB, I created the 3D Map of our Universe: Universe Variables  The layers correspond to distances from us in a normalized Universe (108=13.8 GLY or CMB). The reason for 108 layers is because we have 99 layers up to 0.99 and the rest between 0.99 and 1. This is a work in progress and a better presentation of the data is being built. The high-frequency part of the spectrum present oscillations that might have something to do with the Benford\u2019s Law. The reason I say that is because the spectrum went through nonlinear energy transfer, so any value of l (in spherical harmonics decomposition there are two quantum numbers l and m) is the result of a sum of two (or more) waves. Since the occupation number of any hyperspherical acoustic mode is an integer number, the nonlinear mixing might lead to Benford\u2019s sequence. Copernicus enunciated the Copernican Hypothesis, which is the recognition of our \u201cEarth\u201d ordinary nature. That was a reaction against Religion. Religion preys on our Narcissism and Vanity, so it always places us in a special place. It seems that neither one of them were correct. In a 4D Spacetime where we don\u2019t live in a special place, the Universe is Uniform - translationally invariant. Inflation Theory has no mechanism to make our corner of the woods, Special..:) It turned out that our Corner of the Woods is special. The reason is that our region is likely to be either more stable (less dense and so less prone to galactic collisions) or more stable (denser and so with a higher probability of having planets). Which one depends on precise modeling of galactic collisions and we don\u2019t know yet how that model would work, nor do we have a very precise view of our Universe (despite the efforts of SDSS). Our Corner of the Woods is Special Our place is special\u2026 We seem to be close to the node of local Neutronium Acoustic Oscillation! This center has nothing to do with the center of the Universe. It is just close to a node in the interference pattern of Neutronium Acoustic Oscillations on the hypersphere. At the beginning of the Universe Cycle, as soon as the Universe started expanding, Neutrons became free and released the energy of 1E21 Supernovae explosions. That release of energy wasn\u2019t Uniform and drove acoustic oscillations (the gaussian part of the density oscillations). Prior to the decay of the Neutronium, the Blackholium-Neutronium Phase-Transition jolted the Universe and created the low-frequency hyperspherical patterns we notice in our CMB. It just happened that we are close to the nodes of this interference pattern! These oscillations undermine General Relativity and its 4D Spacetime and take the air of the Copernican Hypothesis. Unfortunately, our special place is not because we are special..:) ################################################ The Evidence in the SDSS BOSS datasets Below is the video showing not only the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory Cosmogenesis theory but also the 3D Map of the Current Universe (Universe at the current Absolute Time).

Around a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang expansion began, the universe was around 10cm in size. (More or less.) But if you go back further, it was smaller. The smallest size that \u201cmakes sense\u201d in our current theories of physics is the \u201cPlanck Length\u201d, or around 10^-35 meters. Our current physics can\u2019t really deal with matter and energy in a size smaller than that, so physicists start tossing around the term \u201csingularity\u201d. They will sometimes say that in the early universe (or in a black hole) matter is contained in a zero-dimensional point. This is obviously nonsense, since the density of such an object would be (whatever mass)/( zero volume), which is mathematically illegal. That\u2019s what a singularity is \u2013 it\u2019s a term from mathematics used to refer to a situation where a function asks you to divide by zero. Sometimes physicists will talk about a singularity as if it\u2019s some kind of physical object. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s a pointer to the fact that our theories are no longer giving us reasonable answers. ",
