            "answer_text": "None are god. Instead they are God's or Allah's messengers and prophets. In Islam god is one and has never had an incarnation. If he every wanted to talk to us he would do so via his prophet and messengers or directly by book, scriptures, or in one case, a burning bush. Though Mohammed has been given more than Jesus or in his arabic name Isa Bint Mariam. Mohhamed has went to heaven and back, met many angels and past prophets, and was promised forgiveness for his past and future sins. So what do I think of the two. I think they are both messengers of god that should be highly renowned as important people in islam. But in no disrespect to the past answers, they are not God's incarnations. ",

            "answer_text": "The historical Jesus of Nazareth is a historical person, was baptized by John the Baptist, and was executed by Rome via crucifixion. There is very little historical information about Muhammad. The vast majority of the content about this man comes down from Islamic traditional sources. He was orphaned many different times, he worked for his wife, later in his life he saw an angel and his career as a prophet started. He united Arabia with Islam (much of it was done by his followers after his death via war (e.g., conquest of Persia)). ",
