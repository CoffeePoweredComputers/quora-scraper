            "answer_text": "They are not the same. However, you touched upon something important. The sciences and humanities are linked together by critical thought. This is the skill required to pursue either domain.  However, there is a major difference between the two fields: how they study.  Math and other \"hard\" sciences focus primarily on quantitative data. They seek to measure, observe and quantify. This gives them facts from which they can use critical thought to develop theories. The humanities and other \"soft\" sciences seek to use human experience and qualitative data as the basis for their theories. They use the same rigor in data collection and peer review as the hard sciences, but what they study is not as quantifiable, at least not in the same way as math and hard science. It is often subject to interpretation, unlike numbers. Each field is equally rigorous and equally important. They each use critical thought and logic to come to rational conclusion. However what they study and how they study it is different enough to require separation. ",

            "answer_text": "What do I think? You are right to see in the Ancient Greek philosophers the trends in thought that eventually led to the scientific revolution --and much else. But that is still not the same thing as \"science and humanities are the same\". They are not, even though they share that common origin. That said, you get a different -- and I would argue better -- exposure to both science and math if you take them at a really good liberal arts college instead of a technical college, because they approach sciences and math as liberal arts.

I like your way of thinking.You know, when you board a train in London, the PA system automatically barks at you: \"Mind the Gap?\"Well, so now, here's: \"Mend the Gap\"...See: Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge (EO Wilson 1998). They (Science & The Arts) have `evolved apart' (let's even say: `speciated' in terms of cultural evolution) over time. For example Romanticism, and later Continental Philosophy was also a big deliberate split. Some of us are currently, trying to: mend the gap.But about 80% (a rough estimate) of academia in the Humanities and Social (so-called?) Sciences is/are (still!) dominated by the vestiges of: Continental Philosophy. But - there is hope. See, all these (fantastic) books: StoryAlity #71 - On Consilience and Creativity...And see:  StoryAlity #14B - Creativity - the missing link between The Two Cultures ",

What makes the natural sciences 'special' is that they rigorously employ the scientific method to gain truth about the the natural world.While some humanities (sociology, for one) also use the scientific method, they use it far less rigorously and mostly only arrive at fuzzy conclusions. ...well, except for math.

It's not a choice, it is usually that the subject matter does not allow for such rigorous testing or control. Take psychology for example. While you may be able to design a good experiment to test a certain theory, it would be complete with control groups and experimental groups, but it may well be completely immoral to subject humans to your tests.
