            "answer_text": "Sound is actually a \u201cmaterial- pressure\u201d wave. Every material wave requires some energy and a material medium to travel. This energy is supplied by the vibrations that provide essential energy for the propagation of sound. It is quite clear as to how the to- & -fro motion of vibrating objects produces sound, but what about a hammer striking a stone ! Your curiosity should be appreciated. Actually what happens is; when the hammer hits the stone, the air between the two surfaces(the striking surface and the surface being struck) gets compressed and then rarefaction takes place. Compression and then rarefaction is the secret behind the production of sound. This phenomenon takes a very small amount of time and a single shock wave is produced which is heard as the characterstic loud thud . This is the how and why sound is heard when hammer strikes stone.
