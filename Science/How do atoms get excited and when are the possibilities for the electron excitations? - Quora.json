            "answer_text": "Send an electron, a photon or heat them. With certain conditions you can excite any atom.  You have to have a photon with an energy of the difference between the initial state of the electron and the final state. No more, no less energy. Same goes with heating up. You must supply a certain amount of heat for an electron to get excited. The excess heat will not be used. But sending an electron is easy. You just have to send an electron with an energy equal or greater than the energy gap. The excess amount of energy of the incoming electron will probably be sent out as an electron with that energy difference. ",
