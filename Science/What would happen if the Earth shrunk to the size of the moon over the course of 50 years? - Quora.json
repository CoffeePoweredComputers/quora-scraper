            "answer_text": "Depends on wether it preserves its mass or doesn't. Case 1: The Earth shrinks 4 times in diameter, the mass remains same as present. The mean density of the shrinked Earth will be about 350 g/cm^3. It more than twice the density of the Sun's core. We are not aware of any physical process that could shrink a planet anywhere close to such density. Besides everything else, the surface gravity of the moon-sized Earth will be 16 g. Everyone dies. Case 2: The density of the Earth remains same as it is now. It means the Earth will lose more than 98% of its mass over the course of 50 years. It will be losing 4x10^15 kg per second, or about 200 cubic miles of matter every second. If the Earth loses the matter from the surface uniformly, it will start at a rate of about 1/10 of an inch, or 2 millometers, of surface depth per second. If the matter is taken from the Earth's core through the fourth dimension - it will cause devastating earthquakes and melt down the Earth's crust. In either scenario - everyone dies. ",
