            "answer_text": "The most basic is to provide food. The animal kingdom in it\u2019s entirety eats other living things. Either plants, or things that eat plants. Living things eat living things. That\u2019s just one way, of course. There are many instances of \u201csymbiotic\u201d relationships where one critter (or plant) will have a relationship that is beneficial to both. Certain fishes find shelter from predators in the many arms of a sea anemone. The fish gets protection, and the anemone feeds off the detritus of the fish\u2019s feeding. Other critters have a parasitic relationship to other creatures. Certain wasps lay their eggs on stung and paralyzed spiders\u2026. When the eggs hatch the larvae devour the spider. There are many parasitic plants. Usually, entire ecosystems rely on such complex relationships. ",

            "answer_text": "Biology is awesome!!! Life is a miracle!!! The products of one is the reactant of the next which provides the reactant to the first. We as humans, harvest energy from glucose and exhale water and carbon dioxide through cellular respiration in order to produce energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). In plants light energy, water, small amounts of glucose, and carbon dioxide that we breathe out are used to produce ATP and NADH in the light reactions. In the Calvin cycle, plants use these chemicals to produce large strands of glucose, called cellulose, which plants use as a structural framework. They as a result exhale oxygen, which as you know humans use to breathe.  So you see, all living things, oxygen breathing organisms and carbon dioxide breathing plants are both critical to each other's survival. The interconnectedness of life is awesome!!! ",
