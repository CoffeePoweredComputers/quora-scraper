            "answer_text": "I think you might want to rethink how you\u2019ve formulated your question. That said, I\u2019m going to give it a shot anyway. If I was to answer your question directly, I would say that a day in a season - say, summer - is affected by a lengthier daytime (the amount of daytime hours in the summer relative to your distance from the equator) by making it warmer\u2026 but that\u2019s not exactly true. Summers are warmer than winters because the Earth\u2019s axis is on a tilt. That said, we\u2019d get less of that warmth if we had less daytime hours, right? On the subject of Seasonal Affective Disorder, and with a little creative interpretation of your question - the presence of sunlight increases your brain\u2019s production of serotonin, a chemical and neurotransmitter in the human body produced in the brain, bowels, and blood platelets. Low levels of serotonin, also known as \u201cthe happy chemical\u201d, have been linked to depression. Depression occurring in annual waves, directly related to seasonal changes (and often measurable through the summer and winter solstices) is the primary characteristic of Seasonal Affective Disorder. Therefore the length of daytime your body receives can be linked to your serotonin levels and (if low) your depression. Disclaimer: I am in no way shape or form a doctor or practitioner of medicine. I am, however, a chronic sufferer of Seasonal Affective Disorder. ",
