            "answer_text": "HEAT rounds or High-Explosive-Anti-Tank rounds make use of the so called Munroe-effect:  During the 1880s it was discovered that by making indentaions into explosives you could focus their explosive energy into a certain direction. The above picture shows how a HEAT round - or to be more precise a shaped charge - is composed: There is your actual shaped charge with a cone cut into one side of it and inside the cone is a thin liner of metal. The liner is very important because it is the part of the shaped charge which will do all the penetration. You can think of it as a cannon with the charge being the propellant and the liner being the projectile.  Upon impact the detonater will cause the main charge to go off, which then directs its explosive energy towards the metal liner. The liner, unable to withstand this force, will bend outwards forming a very thin but extremely fast (usually 7 - 10 km/s) jet of metal (not molten metal though, this is a common misconception). This hypersonic jet travelling at roughly 25 times the speed of sound has an enormous kinetic energy which enables it to penetrate a lot of regular steel armor. The above image also displays another important property of HEAT rounds which needs to be considered: Rotation of the round (shown in the above image on the right) will disperse the jet due to centrifugal forces and greatly reduce its penetration potential. For most of todays weapon systems this isn\u2019t much of a problem because missiles and modern smoothbore tank guns rely on fins to stabilize their projectiles. Even modern rifled guns could effectively fire HEAT rounds by utilizing a so called obturating band which has a diameter slightly larger than the round itself. This band may rotate freely so that when the round goes down the barrel the band will end up absorbing most of the rotation.  The same technique is actually used to fire Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot rounds out of rifled guns such as the famous 105mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, used on most of the early western Main Battle Tanks and also on the first versions of the M1 Abrams!  To counteract protective measures such as explosive reactive armor or simply increase the penetration of your HEAT round it is possible to install multiple shaped charges in succession such as shown above (Russian 125mm tank gun round with 3 shaped charges inside). This concept is called a tandem charge and is standard in most modern HEAT warheads. ",

            "answer_text": "Falk Peterson basically covered everything. I\u2019d just like to add that due to the low mass of the copper liner, and the softer material, compared to something like an APFSDS shell, HEAT warheads are much more easily defeated by modern composites. Because of that you get the complicated armor values of modern tanks where for one type of shell it\u2019s the equivalent of 800mm of steel, but the same piece of armor against a different projectile is equivalent of 1500mm of steel ",
