            "answer_text": "Yes it is a nice thought, that an entire universe would exist inside an atom, and our universe could be an atom of a much bigger universe and so on.  But chances are, that it isn't. Why?  Because Newton's laws of motion, the laws of classical physics, which defines how and why things move the way they move, are not really accurate.  For example, the law says, that if you put force on an object, the object would accelerate proportional to the applied force, things move in straight lines if not acted upon by forces, and space and time are not connected.  But we know from careful studies, that these laws of physics are not really true. They break down, when you look at things which are either, too small, or too big, or going too fast.  So the laws of physics drastically change when things are extremely small, to when things are extremely big. (which is why, we still do not have the theory of everything). Now when I say, the laws of physics change, I don't really mean that nature acts differently at different scales, but what I mean is, the 'averaged out laws' are different.  At sub atomic level, things are uncertain, concept like position, speed, break their meaning. Concept like path taken, and motion itself breaks down. However at macroscopic levels like the world we are living in, things appear very calm. Things don't just pop in and out of existence (like they do at the quantum level), and at the other extreme, when things are too massive or too fast, clocks tick very much different for different people (as shown quite accurately in the move Interstellar). What has this got to do with your question? Well everything.  This basically tells you you just cannot scale everything and assume nature works the same. So galaxies cannot exist at a subatomic level. And if matter becomes too massive or dense, it can even break the fabric of space-time, leading to a singularity, the point of infinite space time curvature.  So scaling just doesn't work that way. Hence it is highly unlikely that, there is a version of me right now, typing an answer on a super subatomic mini computer inside one of gazillion atoms that I am made of or a super duper sized version of me typing this answer who is made of gazillion atoms one of which is our universe!

            "answer_text": "Yes i think its possible. But I look at it more like this. I think. This is a new thought I came up with today based on recent research on anti matter. In every particle is an area in the center that is verry dence. Essentially a black hole. In my theory matter spins in lets just say a clockwise spin. And anti matter is in a counter clock wise spin. Draw it out and you'l understand the following.draw two circles side by side. One clock wise and one counter clockwise. They are oposite spins so there spin directions at there point of contact will be alike. This is why oposite attract. Try the same thing with like spins. There touching side will be spinning in oposite direction and there will be deflection and they will repell each other. Let us say a lone particle of matter is spinning clockwise. On its outer perimeter sets of field of dark energy. The particles spin will disrupt the field and oposite spins will break off. These new spins are anti matter and will spin counter clockwise. This obvious truth sets up the following answere to your question. From here in my theory I ask myself about galexies and the dencer central interior of particles which might be a black hole. Is a black hole made of entirly matter? And is anti matter being consumed by the black hole and the electromagnetic radiation coming from black holes expelled matter that has a like spin to the black hole? I believe matter is expelled at the event horizon before entering the black hole. This would explain why there is more matter then anti matter in the universe. Anti matter is then reborn for the reason explained earlier. From the expelled electromagnetic radiation is formed a galexy around the black hole. As a waiste product of the black hole. In order for a black hole to be a portal to another universe it would have to have a calm eye. Like a huricain. This would happen if inflowing energy ever condencing and moving ever faster reaches a criticle mass of speed and dencity that it can not become dencer at light speeds. And is expelled from the center back out into where it had just cane from inthe black hole. Thus can happen because energy is moving slower the closer to the peremitor of the black hole you get. The interior has the highest speeds and mass. Thus will leave a eye in the black hole. Exiting energy will leave a slight vacume in the eye. An area less dence the the black hole body itself. So a black hole may look like a donut. At thus point I think of the crossing a intersection at half intervals theory. The finite intersection if crossed in half intervals is now a infinte distance. Withen the eye of the black holes eye are now infinite points of location. Leaving infinite room for a bran new universe. Withen this universe every black hole and every particle are portals to new and smaller universes. And this goes on for infinity. Forever larger and forever smaller universes. At some point there had to be a first universe. So the largest universe is the ending point upward. But the smaller universes will forever be born. And they will be forever smaller and increasingly born at a faster and faster pace. ",

Furthermore, there are HUGE problems in the current formulations of physical theory, IE the Standard Model and General Relativity. I would not rule out any metaphysical possibilities personally unless there are clear concise proofs of impossibility. I did a fascinating calculation while I was a Physics undergrad at MIT: so certain molecules can act as magnetic dipoles, which want to stay aligned with any external magnetic field, and if you irradiate a magnetic dipole with RF waves at the right frequency you can perturb these dipoles and force them out of alignment with their external magnetic field. Once the RF pulse ends, the misaligned dipole begins to precess and irradiate it\u2019s potential energy away in the form of RF waves until the dipole is again aligned with the external magnetic field. This precession rate can be calculated from the magnetic dipole strength as well as the external magnetuc field strength. This phenomenon is how Pulsed NMR (IE MRI brain scan technology) works. well it turns out you can do a similar calculaition on astrophysical scales! In GR, you can approximmate one of the terms to be an equivalent \u201cgravito magnetic\u201d force which arises when you have a rotation of mass. This rotation of mass creates a gravito magnetic field, and in turn any rotating mass within this field will feel a force analagous to a magnetic force. So a giant spinning disk of mass (such as a galaxy) would create a fairly strong external gravito-magnetic field. Then consider a planetary system such as the erath orbiting the sun: this circular orbital motion creates a gravito-magnetic dipole, which is immersed in an external gravitoamagnetic field due to the rotation kf the galaxy. This means that if our planetary orbit is misaligned with the disk of the galaxy, then the gravito magnetic dipole (aka planetary system) will seek to be aligned with the external field, and thus will begin to precess and irradiate energy. Running the numbers, for an earth-like planet in a galaxy like ours, the precession period is about 100 times the current life of the universe. So when our verse is 100 times its current age, our planet\u2019s orbital gravito magnetic dipole will cause the orbit to have precessed just once. So with that in mind, just imagine how much could be going on inside of an electron\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Although this may be an idea that more people have cherished, as it seems like such a perfectly balanced model of the universe, there are many concepts and observations that contradict this theory. For starters, the forces that hold an atom together are the strong force and the electromagnetic force. The strong force works on really small distances only, while the electromagnetic force is an interaction between charged particles. Now, as the distance between galaxies is quite large (you could put about 50000000000000000000000 giraffes between the milky way and the andromeda galaxy), the strong force does not play a role. Furthermore, galaxies do not have an electrical charge, so the electromagnetic force is insignificant as well. The only force that does have a, slight, influence on the behaviour of galaxies is the gravitational force, however even this effect is usually negligible, so the galaxies mostly move freely through space, very much unlike the particles in an atom, which behave according to very strict laws of nature. Another reason why the universe could never be an atom inside another universe is quantum mechanics. According to quantum mechanics, the electrons in an atom are not on one specific position, but they are everywhere around the nucleus at the same time, and only if you try to measure where it is exactly, you will find a certain position with a certain probability. On large scales, however, like the universe, it is pretty obvious where something is located. If a galaxy is at one place one day, it will not be at the other side of the universe the other day (even though it may seem like it since the earth is rotating). ",

But the second part of the question is interesting because although the universe is not anything like an atom but it does arise from a singularity and such singularities can also be found in the centre of a black hole. Theoretically each black hole can have an universe arise out of it and our universe may well be inside a black hole. Sad part it we can never find that out with first hand experience . If our universe is contained within a black hole then we cant escape it and go to that universe which held our black hole and similarly if we do fall into a gentle black hole and manage to reach singularity without getting spaghettified then we may end up in a different universe all together but there is no hope what so ever of us communicating that information back to our home universe. So yeah universes can contain other universes within them for the simple reason that infinities can contain smaller infinities within it ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting Question.  It ~is~ possible but then again we know from astrophysics (thank you Hawking) that \"Black holes have no hair\" (lol in french).  This amounts to essentially them being elementary particles. This sentiment was echoed by Brian Green in his famous book the Elegant Universe* and it's more interesting equal The Fabric of Spacetime*   Thinking about the rubber sheet analogy, we discover that falling into a black hole puts one \"outside\" the universe. This is because the spacetime curvature becomes infinite--perpendicular to the undisturbed \"grid\" of deep, empty space, meaning that this hole (2D) extends to the very end of the universe itself (there's some reasons* why we will make the assumption it is in fact finite, even though the question presumes that). If we add in the appropriate dimension giving us three we find that it's just a giant void, and you invert from being inside the universe to going outside, smashed on a small patch of the boundary of the universe.  The Holographic Principle states that all the information about this black hole is encoded on it's surface, and they have used this same thinking to apply to the entire universe. It's a big theoretical questions to understand the boundary conditions of the universe, one that may never be solved. But the important takeaway is that there is an unusual relationship to the universe as a whole and black holes, which we have already established are just bizarre gargantuan elementary particles. So... what if the universe is just a giant electron or neutrino? ++ Important Disclaimer: Not a Physicist++ *inks to come soon ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no.Yes; To be honest when we extend and generalise logic and universal symmetry, this seems quite a true possibility. No; But for your statement to be true, it needs to be proved - scientifically and mathematically. Sadly humankind as a species has not devised of ways with which your theory can or cannot be proved experiementally. Hahahaha, think about it, reality check, we don\u2019t even know the proper definition of things we take for granted- light, energy, force, time, thoughts, field etc. let alone building arguments upon it. We haven\u2019t been able to verify the speed of light accurately, upon which we build so many laws, not have we been able to isolate neutrinos, which we say make up most of the observable universe. We are just not at that stage yet. My opinion: I really think the comprehension of these thoughts lies beyond human thoughts, as we, because we are made of atoms, are a part of the system. We look at ants and explain their behaviour easily as we look at their system from outside. Internally, as a system of atoms, we tend to complicate things and perception due to consciousness. This consciousness provides us both, evolutionary survival benefit over other species, and a dilemma over our own existence- question over where do we fit. Consider your question being a part of the latter case. Being a scientific mind, I hate to not answer your question and still not being satisfied with my answer. I am sorry, So are all the brilliant minds who live and die trying to figure out the \u201ctheory of everything\u201d. As a fellow homo sapien, my honest answer to this question is Shut the F up! Pay your bills, reproduce, and Live and die peacefully. That\u2019s what matters and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing for over generations. :) ",

            "answer_text": "It shouldn\u2019t take rocket science to ascertain that matter \u2014 in whatever form \u2014 respects some form of immutable law(s) regardless of the size of interaction (force fields) it relates to. Now of course, those force fields, when hugely dispersed throughout the cosmic void, may oscillate (expand/collapse) in a manner different than what we can observe at the atomic level. But if we believe in the Big bang theory, and could rewind the makings of a universe to the size of the universe of an atom, then most cosmic forces and ensuing matter (the observable ones) would simply regress into a form strictly necessary for the maintenance of a sub-atomic structure (the part we miss the most). So yes, all things related, the mechanics behind it all can validate the plausibility implied in your question. Try this at home: Take a deck of cards, remove two of them, align those two together to create a standing triangle. Now, take the rest of the pack of cards, and create the same shape by stacking them vertically. See? Took the same type of cards to replicate the same shaped standing triangle, but of course it took more cards to build the taller one. Also, the two-card triangle deals with less forces in order to keep its upright shape while the stacked version needs to deal with a lot more constraints in order to remain upright. So, small or huge, the basic components and structure remain the same, albeit in differing quantities and size, quite a balancing act indeed!  ",

            "answer_text": "Pattern recognition is one of the starting perk stats of being born a human, but also screws us sometimes. What I mean by this: Viewing the universe as a circular three dimensional object, comes naturally to us, more naturally than things we haven\u2019t seen or can't even imagine the look of properly. The issues that arise with this are as follows. although object in our universe are three dimensional, the universe is not itself three dimensional. We have no center of force or geometry like an atomic nuclei. Even if we assumed a center of force the force isn\u2019t lined up in a sustainable way as it is with atoms even with an assumption of extreme amount of radioactive decay outwards force. There would be more disruption in the cosmic background from bombardment forces since atoms experience constant bombardment of repulsion and attraction from its orbiting electrons and neighboring atomic nuclei, even in a vacuum other crap pops up outta no where and effects other things. Even with all this, yes, there is a chance maybe we could be something similar to an atom we have never known in properties, but, ya know Occum\u2019s razor and all that; its more likely you\u2019re seeing a pattern and drawing a conclusion that doesn\u2019t exist because of a hiccup in known biology than all these unheard of physical anomalies all lining up at once, even in the realm of the unknown. Still, good job on being curious and thinking about stuff. Keep it up and just be careful about letting your own head screw with ya into a self feeding mental circle jerk; even Tesla and Newton got lost in their own personal rabbit holes in the end, ",

More likely our universe is a quantum, perhaps a quark, in an atomic nucleus in the next universe \u201cup\u201d in scale, as every quark in our universe is a universe, and so on in both \u201cdirections\u201d of scale, without end. For that model to be viable, the spacetime metric would need to be curved everywhere not just locally near mass aggregates. The expansion cosmological model is a flat, Euclidean concept, not curved. The geometry of General Relativity (Riemannian geometry) would have to serve as the general condition of the spacetime metric even far from mass aggregates., That would mean the spacetime metric is generally curved and mass only induces local curvature. Here\u2019s a short animated video of kinetic Riemannian geometry for your viewing pleasure:  ",

This all comes to a relativity theory, of which time, by the way, is also a factor! To address the comments where they say that those electrons are moving fast while planets are not, one could argue that it may only seem so, from \u201cour reality\u2019s\u201d perspective, because we are putting our own time stamp on our observations. The other comment which states that those galaxies \u201cabove us\u201d are not really moving, is actually kind of supports the point about time \u201cscale\u201d differences. Remember that theory about the \u201ctime slowing\u201d paradox inside the spaceship if it keeps picking up the speed? But again, that slowing is measured from our perspective. To those on the ship AND looking back at the solar system via telescope, our planets will probably seem to move faster, the faster the ship goes away. Moreover, at some point of time (relative to people on that speeding spaceship), the telescope they are using to look back at the solar system would kind of, gradually, become more like a microscope. Relatively speaking, the \u201csize\u201d of the solar system to them (again, with its faster and faster moving \u201cplanets\u201d) will be getting smaller and smaller, right?\u2026 ",

There is a hierarchy of physical structure with stars and planets composed of atoms, galaxies composed of stars, gas and dust and dark matter. Individual nuclei are made up of 3 quarks, so an atom may have 3 quarks or up to hundreds of quarks total. But galaxies are composed of up to hundreds of billions of stars or more. The structure of galaxies and stars is ruled by gravity and electromagnetic interactions. The physics of atoms and nuclei is ruled by the strong and weak nuclear forces, as well as by electromagnetic interactions.  ",

And we know that quarks and electrons have no internal detail to a very high resolution.

If you view processes from the organizational patterns and laws they have in common, then yes, but unless you know that the other objects around us are atoms with which we interact with as real atoms interact with eachother, then you can't say for sure. I believe you can safely say our planet is organised in a similar pattern as atoms, or perhaps that we have accidentally described the subatomic world in the same way we describe our solar system to be oganized.

Einstein even said time is an illusion, but we need it to base our reality on, time is running out and we need to follow it because time is our reality, and this is how we developed maths because we understood time, the sun dials were the start of all physics, by creating a number calcus to count the time the shadow moves on a sun dial. ive forgot what the question is now !!!!!!!!

This article delves into the question if all is united or not: 2.
