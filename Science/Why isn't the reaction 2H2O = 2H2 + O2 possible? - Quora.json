            "answer_text": "It is though\u2026 It isn\u2019t spontaneous under standard conditions (THANK GOD FOR THAT, otherwise we\u2019d all be dead and all\u2026 ) However, if you provide a driving force (electric current for example), this reaction is possible. The electrolysis of water yields the following: 2H20 + i \u2192 2H2 + O2 Here\u2019s the breakdown. Cathode (reduction): 2 H2O(l) + 2e\u2212 \u2192 H2(g) + 2 OH\u2212(aq) Anode (oxidation): 2 OH\u2212(aq) \u2192 1/2 O2(g) + H2O(l) + 2 e\u2212 Balance that out and the net reaction gets you the reaction above! That's the cool thing about electrolysis reactions, by providing an external driving force you can make nonspontaneous reactions (under standard conditions that is) occur. ",

            "answer_text": "It absolutely is possible. But it is energetically \u201cuphill\u201d so you need to put in energy. One way to do that is by passing an electric current through the water. This is called electrolysis. (Note that the opposite reaction is downhill. If you burn hydrogen you get water and energy.) ",
