            "answer_text": "Your question is incorrect. Elements do not \u201chave\u201d these things \u2026 atoms of the elements do. So, your question would be more correctly stated as \u201cwhich element has atoms that have.\u2026\u201d Even then, the question is incorrect. Atoms do not \u201chave\u201d neutrons and protons. Atoms have electrons and a nucleus. The nucleus was made by the fusing of protons and neutrons into the new particle, that we refer to as an atomic nucleus. When that occurred, the protons and neutrons no longer existed. We know this because the nucleus weighs less than the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons that went into its making. I repeat, an atomic nucleus is a single particle. It is unfortunate that our schools and textbooks use shortcuts like \u201catoms are made of electrons, protons, and neutrons\u201d and diagrams showing nuclei to be made of two kinds of particles clumped together. If that were true, the positive charge on the protons, at such very close range, would result in the nucleus flying apart. Since the individual particles no longer exist, this cannot happen and very large amounts of positive charge can be incorporated into such nuclei. To insist that the neutrons and protons are still physically there in a nucleus is the equivalent of digging through a chocolate cake, looking for the eggs that went into its baking. ",

            "answer_text": "I will show you how to identify what an element is when you know its number of protons, and the other most effective thing is Periodic Table. From now on, whatever elements you can still identify it through those 2 tools First, you must know a thing called \"atomic number\" (often written in short way as \"Z\"). Don't worry! That \"atomic number\" is just another name of\u2026 the number of protons of an element. In periodic Table, it's often written in the under, left of the element's name in a cell Any element is specialized with others by only its atomic number. So, you don't have to worry whether you mistook it with others. e.g. Sodium atom always has 11 protons, and of course, any atoms having 11 protons are always Sodium The next step is easier, you just need a Periodic Table and know to use it The element having 18 protons is Argon. The number of neutrons and electrons are not necessary in identifying what an element is. So you can forget these details (except some elements are not found) ",

We can use the number of neutrons (20 neutrons) to find the mass number of the element. The mass number of the element is the sum of the protons and the neutrons. So 18 +20 = 38. ",
