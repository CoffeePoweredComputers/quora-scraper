            "answer_text": "If space and time can be described as the singular Minkowski spacetime, then how does a photon (from its inertial reference frame) travel through space without traveling through time? A photon doesn\u2019t have its own inertial reference frame. If it did, it would be moving at the speed of light in vacuo (c) and be at rest at the same time. And if you can get around that, from the photon\u2019s point of view the universe would be a plane of zero thickness containing infinite energy with its time frozen, but frozen at what time? The time the photon was created? The time it was absorbed? The average? And the Lorentz transforms break down at speed c. You get a divide-by-zero \u2014 which is bad! There is no such thing as an inertial reference frame moving at speed c. I worked with physicists for many years, and I don\u2019t think this has ever come up. Regardless, nothing useful has come from the idea. ",

            "answer_text": "Spacetime is only a man made concept. Space actually exists, as you can see any space that is occupied. You do know that there is a relatively empty space between two objects, even though you can't see that empty space but you do know that it is there. Time doesn't actually exist, as time is just the name of our man made motion measuring system. We use this concept called time, to measure any motions unknown velocity in the universe, like a photon, against the known consistent angular rotational velocity of motion of the earth. So the photon only travels through space not time, as you cannot travel through a man made measuring concept like the physicists keep promoting. This belief in the supernatural that time actually exists somewhere in the universe, has a cult following in physicis. ",
