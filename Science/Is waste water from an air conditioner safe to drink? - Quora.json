            "answer_text": "It's already been said that the water / condensation is very clean - until it makes contact with anything else - but no one's mentioned keeping it clean.  Atmospheric water generators, like Willie Nelson's pictured below, use the same process as your air conditioner for condensation but collect and filter it.  They can look like regular \"water coolers\" but there's no big blue bottle on top or a water line connection yet it supplies you with several gallons of water, daily, depending on humidity.  They do require filters that can be quite expensive.  e.g. The Aquaboy, sold at Office Depot & OfficeMax: Office Supplies and Furniture, requires $259.00 / year in filters on top of the initial $1,999.99 purchase price.  The guy that created the 5 Hour Energy\u00ae drinks  has a company that created an \"industrial sized\" version that could be transported globally for disaster response, etc...  There's a YouTube documentary about him that shows the water generator and several other cool things he's working on called \"Billions in Change.\"  He's devoted his time and fortune to bettering the lives of the bottom 50% of the global population and is quite an inspiration. . . All that being said. . .   Don't drink the water from your air conditioner.  :-)  [1] Billions in Change   [2] Willie Nelson's Water From Air   Footnotes[1] Billions in Change Official Film[2] Willie Nelson\u2019s Water from Air",

            "answer_text": "I would say maybe, however you risk the potential for the water to have metal particles in it, dust and dirt, and perhaps far worse bacteria that may be unreasonable with you and give you a bad case of the craps. If you filtered it and then boiled it, surely it would be a lot safer and cleaner too. Someone posted about distilled water being the purest water there is. But this is a partial truth and one so many misunderstand. You see, distilled water is only a little bit cleaner or purer or safer then it was before it was distilled. Its not like distillation just makes everything liquid clean, clear and safe. For example if you distill muddy water then the water that re-condenses into your container will still be slightly muddy looking. Ive done that experiment to prove it as well. all a water distiller does is makes it a little cleaner with less minerals in it then it originally had. And this works fairly well with tap water given tap water is usually not that dirty or polluted, So distilling your tap water will give you water that is cleaner, purer and with less minerals and toxins then it had previously. Of course there are stages to some distilleries in factories where water is distilled several times and each time in each stage the water gets a little more pure. Where as the regular one stage distiller someone has at home will only get the water a little cleaner. But of course one can re-distill the water several times if one wants. ",
