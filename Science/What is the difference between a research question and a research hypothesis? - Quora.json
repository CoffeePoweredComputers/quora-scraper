            "answer_text": "It is fuzzy. I think I have an answer, which I will give, though I bet if you asked 10 different academics, you would get 10 slightly varying answers. Anyway, here is my attempt. A research hypothesis is a type of research question, but not all research questions are hypotheses. Let\u2019s say I was giving a talk to a group of professors and peers. I might start out by giving some background on the matter, then use this background to explain the missing knowledge which I would like to work towards filling. I might frame these missing pieces as research questions. These sort of questions may be rather high-level and beyond the scope of a single study, or even an individual's entire career in research. These questions might require many researchers over many years testing many different hypotheses. A hypothesis, on the other hand, is specific and the conditions for its success/failure are well defined. Your hypotheses are tied to the research/study at hand. As concrete examples, I may make a statement such as \u201cwe know that stroke survivors benefit from contemporary therapy when measured in the lab using A, B, and C outcomes, but it is unclear to what extent this therapy actually translates into real-world benefits\u201d. Here we have a legitimate research question: \u201cHow does contemporary therapy in stroke survivors affect real-world performance?\u201d. Performance could be measured in many ways. It would be impossible to run a single study to answer this question, though perhaps an entire research initiative could help chisel away at it. One researcher in the initiative may form a study with the hypothesis that \u201cthe group receiving contemporary therapy X following their stroke incident will result in more steps taken per day (on average) compared to the group that received traditional therapy Y following their stroke incident\u201d. That is a specific hypothesis and a research question unto itself, though it also helps contribute to the broader research question of \u201cHow does contemporary therapy in stroke survivors affect real-world performance?\u201d.

            "answer_text": "A research question would set boundaries for the area to be explored and the answers that your research need to answer and hypothesis is a scientific way in which you assume an answer to the research question or its sub-components and then test if your assumption was correct. For instance, if you have a research done on causes of software project failures then your research question might be - What are the key causes of project failure in IT? based on this question, you may write answers and then develop hypotheses from them as follows: Answer: Unclear Project scope, Lack of budget and Lack of Project management skills are reasons behind project failure. So your hypotheses would be: 1. H0: Null Hypothesis - Unclear project scope causes project failureHa: Alternate Hypothesis - Unclear Project Scope does not cause project failure Prove that your null hypothesis is correct and the cause you identified becomes your answer otherwise alternate hypothesis is true and you can say that Unclear Project scope does not cause project failure. In similar way, you will have more hypotheses: 2. H0: Null Hypothesis - Lack of budget causes project failureHa: Alternate Hypothesis - Lack of budget does not cause project failure 3. H0: Null Hypothesis - Lack of Project management skills  causes project failureHa: Alternate Hypothesis - Lack of Project management skills does not cause project failure So research question actually asks a question and hypothesis proves the possible answers. At times research question can also present question in the form of answer itself and hypothesis proves them. For example, research question could be:Does unclear project scope causes project failure? and the hypothesis assumptions say yes or no to this answer which you can prove thereafter using statistical methods of hypothesis testing ",
