            "answer_text": "The color of water varies with the surrounding conditions in which that water is present. Though relatively small quantities of water appear to be colourless, pure water has a slightly blue colour that becomes a deeper blue as the thickness of the observed sample increases. The blue colour of water is an intrinsic property whic is caused by selective absorption and scattering of white light. In addition, the dissolved elements or suspended impurities may give water a different color. ",
