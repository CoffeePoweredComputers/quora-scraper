            "answer_text": "\u201cPoint of no return\u201d doesn\u2019t apply literally but we ARE past the point of \u201cit\u2019s going to get bad\u201d. As the human race has done for eons, we will survive and adapt and then recover but we will have to endure the consequences of our greed, stupidity, arrogance, and apathy to act sooner. Most people just don\u2019t realize how big a problem it is. Imagine a fully loaded supertanker ship moving at high speed and then you completely turn off the engine. It would travel for miles and miles before slowing down. The Earth\u2019s atmosphere is like that only much much worse. If we stopped all pollution today, it would be years before global warming would even stop increasing. The thermal momentum of the entire Earth\u2019s atmosphere is so large that it would be decades before it would subside in its rate of increase at all and then decades more before it decreased and returned to preindustrial levels. Best guess is it would take about 100 years if we did nothing to help it along and about 75 years if we did everything we could possibly do to remove as much CO2 and we could. Unfortunately, we are likely to do neither. We certainly will not stop all fossil fuel use anytime soon, so the 100 years won\u2019t start until we do. And then it is unlikely we will invest the required vast amounts of money to remove C02 on a global scale. Most of the models that include likely social and political responses put the return to normal out beyond 150 years. The \u201csmall changes\u201d we are doing now and have done so far is sort of like trying to empty the ocean with a spoon. Of all of the \u201cgreen\u201d efforts so far - using LED bulbs, improved MPG in cars, installed all the wind and solar farms, switched from coal to gas in some plants, etc. etc. - all we have done so far has had only a very tiny effect of slowing the rate of increase in emissions and greenhouse gases. We have not even approached an actual decrease in global emissions. Here is how big the problem is. The large tankers and freighters that move oil and manufactured goods around the world burn the dirtiest and cheapest diesel fuel as soon as they get outside of the port or out of sight of land. The amount of fossil fuel burned and the amount of greenhouse gases emitted that just ONE of these ships puts into the atmosphere for just ONE transocean trip is more than enough to offset the use of CFL and LED light bulbs in EVERY light in the entire US. There are 52,000 such ships and about 18,000 of them at sea at any given time. The truth is that small changes have virtually zero effect on climate changes. Very very large efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions, completely stopping the use of all fossil fuels and beginning global scrubbing of the atmosphere to capture and sequester CO2 will have virtually no effects for decades. Like that supertanker at the start of this answer, it will take a long time to slow and stop it and meanwhile, we will suffer the effects. see also: Tom Watkins's answer to Why has climate change caused so many bad effects over the years, but very few people seem to care? Tom Watkins's answer to Has anyone decided by what criterion we will know for certain that man has induced a world climate disaster? EDIT Response to comments: I wish I was wrong but when you strip away all the BS and political misdirection and the scientific soft-peddling, it is indeed gruesome. Everyone has an agenda so you would be safer to just assume that whatever you hear is probably not the whole story or is not right. As much as the Republicans oppose the whole concept, it is remarkable to me that if you trace backward, you almost always find someone that has a financial stake in opposing climate change. I spoke with one climate scientist and asked her what is REALLY going to happen. She actually started to cry because she said it was going to be bad,,,,real bad. I asked her why she didn\u2019t say that in her public speeches. She said she can\u2019t tell people there is no hope of heading off the really bad shit. If she and her fellow scientists did that, people would give up and not do anything at all. The whole idea of holding the rise to 2 degrees is impossible but it gives people hope. One of the things she and other scientists do not talk about anymore is the \u201ctipping points\u201d. The threshold of temp rise that will trigger a massive positive feedback loop that will snowball into much larger and faster temp rises. Have We Passed the Climate Change Tipping Point? Everything you need to know about climate tipping points One that does get into the press is the reduction of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. The more that melts, the more open black ocean is exposed to absorb more heat which then melts more ice. Potential \u2018Hot Spots\u2019 for Melting Sea Ice Identified in the Arctic Ocean Arctic permafrost thawing and sea ice melting faster than before, report says | The Star Another tipping point is the release of methane from the Arctic tundra. As the permafrost thaws, it is releasing methane in huge volumes. Methane is 103 times more effective as a greenhouse gas than CO2. Once it starts, it can release more greenhouse gases within a few years than has been released by all other sources since 1800. Projected temp rise will be in excess of 5 degrees as a result. The problem is that the thawing of the permafrost has already begun. Alaska\u2019s Permafrost Is Thawing Thawing permafrost could have catastrophic consequences, scientists warn 'Abrupt thaw' of permafrost beneath lakes could significantly affect climate change models A third tipping point is the release of CO2 from the ocean bottoms. Millions of tons of CO2 are captured on the bottom of the oceans and deep lakes of the world and will be released when the waters warm down to those depths. It will happen much sooner in lakes all over the world. The amount that could be released is only estimated but it would almost certainly be enough to raise global temps by several degrees. This is not going to happen anytime soon but historical records show that it has happened in each of the last several global warming periods. Earth's oceans ended the last Ice Age Warming oceans speeding up climate change cycle Warming oceans face CO2 tipping point The big problem is that we don\u2019t know when or at what level each tipping point is at. Some are estimated to be far away in the future but some others may have already passed by. Whatever happens, we will have to deal with it but the question boils down to,\u201dwhen will we stop making it worse?\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a figure of 4\u00b0C warming which many climate scientists regard as a irreversible point. 4\u00b0C is roughly the same as the as the difference between the last ice age and today. There is a world bank report on the subject \"Turn Down the Heat: Why a 4\u00b0C Warmer World Must be Avoided. With a 4\u00b0 warming you would see thermal expansion of the oceans which would result in a lot of coastal flooding, disruption of harvests etc. We need to go back something like 130,000 years have comparable temperatures. We have now passed 1\u00b0C warming and current efforts are to try and keep things below 2\u00b0C. Even if we stopped all CO2 emissions today we would still see continuing temperature rises. There is a graph which shows what might happen, with different levels, of C02 emissions. We are probably between the moderate and high growth models. Moderate growth might keep up clear of 4\u00b0C this century. Political will does not seem strong enough to hit the low growth target. This might change soon as the evidence becomes so so clear that even some presidential candidates will not be able to ignore it.  Graph from NASA. Note the graph is a little out of date and temperatures have 1995 as a base rather then the pre-industrial average. To take the question title literally, we can interpret \u201cno return\u201d as will it return to the long term pre-industrial average? Even looking at the yellow no emissions line temperatures are still going up slightly for the next century. Its likely to take a very long time to go back to historic averages. Looking beyond 2100 at the Long-term effects of global warming, include melting of the Greenland Ice sheet, this might take 1000 years to completely melt causing a 7m sea level rise. If we look at much longer time scales there is a roughly 100,000 year period to ice ages and interglacials. These seem to be driven by Milankovitch cycles due to earths orbit. Eventually we will probably see return to ice age conditions but this will be 10,000 years plus. ",

            "answer_text": "We have not passed the point of no return in relation to climate change because we have never been in a state where we could \u201creturn\u201d to begin with. Why? It\u2019s because our ego, our desire to enjoy at the expense of others, won\u2019t let us. It tries to exploit nature to the very last drop. If it sees a profit motive, then it runs to make that profit, stepping on everyone and everything\u2014including nature\u2014in order to do so. Ecologically dystopian scenarios such as earthquakes burying us in rubble, or volcanic lava toppling us, or a tsunami flushing us away come closer to being people\u2019s visions of what could very well take place if we don\u2019t do something about it. The thought that we won\u2019t face such scenarios in our lifetime somewhat calms us down. However, it\u2019s a pity that our grandchildren have increased chances of facing such scenarios, so we generally don\u2019t think about them either. Therefore, in relation to the ecology, out of a lack of options, we continue business as usual. We still do not know how to work with nature. If we knew exactly how nature works and what ecological balance truly depends on, then we would be able to take the necessary steps to reach ecological stability. Nature has four levels: inanimate, vegetative, animate and human. Every subsequent level is greater than and controls the level before it. For instance, the inanimate level preserves form, and the vegetative level, using the inanimate level as its foundation, grows from it. Likewise, the animate level consumes from the vegetative level in order to survive. The human level is the greatest and most influential of all levels, bringing about the greatest changes in nature. For the time being, those changes are negative, but they can be positive. However, it doesn\u2019t work as is commonly thought, by acting to save the ecology, whether it be saving trees, or saving a certain species of animal, or stopping the pollution of oceans or the air, or a myriad amount of other actions we do in order to try and be more ecologically friendly. No such actions will help the ecology, because they do not touch on the ecology\u2019s causal problem. Where, then, is the root problem with the ecology? The problem is with human beings, or more succinctly, how we relate to each other. Changing nature to a positive course can be done only at the human level. This does not mean that we should act toward the lower levels of nature: inanimate, vegetative and animate. On the contrary, all we need to work on in order to bring about a new level of ecological balance is to repair connections at the human level itself. It is a grave mistake to think that we would cause some kind of positive environmental effect by stopping to burn fuel, or stopping to dump garbage into the ocean, or stopping to use pesticides, or many other actions we do toward nature\u2019s lower levels. Even if tomorrow the whole of humanity would stop polluting the environment, we would nevertheless continue seeing ecological disasters hitting us left, right and center. It is because, above the ecological level, human relations\u2014the most influential aspect of nature\u2014would remain broken. Our exploitative, manipulative and abusive relations to each other would continue causing negative ripples throughout nature, feeding back to us with nature\u2019s negative response. Therefore, only the correction of human relations can bring about balance between us and with the ecology. Then the question arises: If we would aim for a positive emotional connection to one another, would this mean that, in parallel, we should nevertheless do such actions as using less fuel and the many actions ecologists recommend? The answer is no. There would be no need. Why? It\u2019s because nature, at a higher level, would take care of all these phenomena. The principle here is that nature\u2019s higher level corrects all corruptions of its lower levels. In the wisdom of Kabbalah, this principle is called \u201clove covers all transgressions.\u201d Each level in nature is considered as higher or lower in terms of whether it is a more or less influential part of the system. The human level, thus, is the most influential level in the entire system of nature. It covers the lower levels and receives everything they have, both positive and negative. Therefore, as human beings, we absorb everything we have done on this planet on the inanimate, vegetative and animate levels, and in order to bring about balance, we need to rise to a higher level and stimulate balance from there. Balance at the higher level is positive human connections, i.e. that we reach nothing less than love for one another. Implementing positive human connections is all we need to do in order to bring about a better world in every respect. Since we currently have corrupt attitudes to each other, where we relate to each other through a constant egoistic lens\u2014self-benefit at the expense of others\u2014then we cannot fix anything at the inanimate, vegetative nor animate levels, because we simply input our egoistic attitude into the system, and it feeds back negatively toward us. By investing in the human level alone, i.e. in positive human connections, we also activate the quickest and most dynamic change possible: the moment we cause a positive change in human relations, the lower levels of nature will experience immediate positive effects. Here, we reach one more question that I\u2019d like to address: Do we need to all reach harmonious human relations right away, or is it enough for us to have a tendency toward positive connections? For instance, let\u2019s say that 100km away from where I am now, there is a point that has \u201clove your friend as yourself\u201d written on it. If I start moving toward that target, which is 100km away, then even by making the first tiniest step toward it, still with 100km to go, I already impact a change in the entire natural system. Why? It is because I changed my attitude. By changing my attitude to nature, i.e. by wanting to relate to nature globally and integrally, as a unified system, and with a loving and caring attitude, then even though I only slightly set off a trigger in that direction, I nevertheless activated the entire system toward a direction of positive unification. Nothing else is demanded of us. We need only deal with human relations. We don\u2019t need to be concerned with the inanimate, vegetative and animate levels of nature. They will all work out and respond harmoniously to us when we reach harmonious connections among each other. Therefore, all we need is the kind of education and influences to set us on the course to achieve positive human connection, and we\u2019ll then be able to enjoy a harmonious life, balanced with nature on all of its levels.

            "answer_text": "You want the facts? We are already past the point of no return. What if we could wave a magic wand that instantly stopped all greenhouse gases (the cause of global warming) to cease being released into our atmosphere? We'd return the Earth's temperature back to that of our ancesters!--right? Nope, not at all. The temperature would actually continue to increase for decades. Given 3-4 decades the Earth's temperature would eventually reach an equilibrium--but it still would have increased by another ~1.1 F (0.6 C)[1] . \u201cBut why?\u201d You're probably asking. Since greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere like a big \u2018ol blanket, where do you think all that heat goes? It goes to two main things: AirWaterIt takes much less energy (about 4 times less) to heat up air by 1 C than with water, meaning it takes much longer for the oceans to heat up. This is why we wouldn't see temperatures stop rising immediately, it takes time to heat up the oceans. It also doesn't help that this also heats up the ice caps, more water to heat up!  [2] So tldr:: It takes a lot time to heat up the oceans, which means we are already past the point of no return (we would have to wait decades). Should this scare you? Probably!  Note: A way to measure how much energy is required to raise a material\u2019s temperature is called specific heat. I based my point about air v. water on this. Air has a specific heat of about 1.00 [math]kJ/kg * C[/math] [3] and water about 4.2 [math]kJ/kg * C[/math] [4] . So clearly water requires more kilojoules (energy!) to heat up per C.

            "answer_text": "That is a complex question. Most climate scientists believe that if the temperature goes above a certain point, positive feedback loops will go into effect that will themselves increase the temperature, triggering other positive feedback mechanisms and so on. For example, as white ice melts, darker water or dirt below it is exposed. This darker material absorbs more heat, which increases the temperature even without more CO2 being put into the atmosphere. This increased heat melts more ice, increasing the temperature more, which melts more ice, and so on. This reaction could continue until there is no more ice to melt, at which point it could be quite hot. Another feedback loop is that as it gets hotter and dryer, plant life dies. This releases more CO2 into the air, which raises the temperature, which kills more plants, and so on. Also, as water in the ocean warms, it cannot hold as much CO2 dissolved in it. It then starts releasing CO2, which warms the air, which warms the oceans, causing them to release more CO2, and so on. There are other feedback loops that involve releasing trapped methane, changing cloud patterns, and so on. You get the idea. In answer to your question, most experts estimate that an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (about 3.6 F) is the level at which these reactions will be triggered and run out of control. There is some disagreement on the exact figure. Scientists estimate that the CO2 level that will bring about this temperature increase is about 350 to 400 PPM. Since we just passed 400 PPM this year, we are in big trouble. It does take some time for the increased CO2 to actually increase the temperature (just as water does no boil the instant you put the pot on the stove), but if we do not actually bring down the CO2 level within the next few decades, the chain reaction could be unstoppable. I should point out that even if these reactions do become unstoppable and have disastrous consequences, additional greenhouse gas emissions will have an effect. Assume, for example, that the actions do occur and these feedback loops themselves increased the temperature by 5 C (9 F). Whether we add an additional X PPM of CO2 today will still determine whether the temperature goes up an additional X degrees. Therefore, even if catastrophic feedback is unavoidable, we can still affect the degree of the final devastation. ",

We dump 30 billion metric tons of heat trapping hydrocarbon pollution into our atmosphere every year from burning fossil fuel. In the past century of burning coal, oil and natural gas we have dumped three trillion metric tons into our atmosphere. Hydrocarbons trap heat and take decades to dissipate. This information comes from decades of independent tests by over two thousand scientists worldwide. The whole world gets it, but our oil corporations don't want renewable energy competition from wind and solar farms. They have bought and paid for politicians and certain radio and TV networks to say it's a hoax. It's not. This trapped heat has warmed our oceans. Much more of this water is evaporating into storm clouds causing catastrophic hurricanes in summer and lake effect snow storms in winter. Trump pulled us out of the Paris Climate Accord by November 2020 because the three Russian banks he has his business loans from are owned by Russian oil barons, including Putin. But many states and most large cities here are ignoring him and actually exceeding the Accord's pollution limits by producing much less hydrocarbon pollution. India is fully on board and China is opening up over fifteen million jobs in wind turbine and solar panel production. President Carter started us on solar and wind energy but Reagan cancelled that initiative because his PAC money came from Exxon. We could have been world leaders in this field but now we're followers, losing millions of renewable energy jobs to China, India and Germany. Hopefully wiser heads here will prevail\u2026 ",

Of course we have passed the point of no return in terms of initiating human-caused climate change.  We did that a long time ago. 2. Yes, we have passed the point of no return leading to dangerous climate change for some regions and ecosystems. 3. We simply don't know yet whether we have passed the point of no return leading to dangerous climate change one would consider \"global,\" and there's good reason to think we could walk ourselves back from that if we really wanted to. The likelihood of the former goes up over time, and possibility of the latter goes down. 4.  Absent a huge change in our energy economy in the next 2-3 decades, we will probably have locked in some very bad manifestations of climate change that could easily lead to a significant reduction in the carrying capacity of the planet (it wouldn't take a lot of bad luck in terms of crop failures in key regions).   But ultimately, who is the \"we\" we are talking about here.  There is a very real possibility that North America could come out of this in relatively good shape.  Abandon Texas, take over Canada, walls ourselves off, and we could be set!  So we can relax! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cPoint of no return\u201d is a loaded term. It means when there is no going back to the way things were, but it also implies a runaway situation that will not subside. The way the question is put in relation to anthropogenic climate change is, have we passed a tipping point? The tipping point concept distinguishes between change that will subside to an equilibrium and change with no prospect of stability. No matter how we respond as a species, the momentum of climate change will continue past our lifetimes because of the ocean\u2019s storage and slow release of heat. Just as a car doesn\u2019t stop instantly when the brakes are applied, the human impact on climate won\u2019t stop as soon as we quit using fossil fuels. The cumulative effect of putting an excess of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will continue for awhile and may result in an equilibrium rather different from the one before the industrial revolution when fossil fuel combustion began. Add to this the natural variation in climate regime over the scores and hundreds of millennia. Whatever the future holds, it will present our species with a world affected by a combination of natural change and human impact. We have steered the planet to a course it would not have followed. The fundamental problem is the human inadequacy when conceptualizing long spans of time. Steps to address climate change that do not yield immediate and unambiguous results will discourage most people. It is entirely possible that the momentum of climate change despite the abandonment of fossil fuels might lead to a campaign to revive their usage. Special interests will argue that we were mistaken, and the public insistence on instant results would bolster this false conclusion. We\u2019ve got ourselves into a Pogo conundrum. Not just our bad behavior, but our bad reasoning and memory skills. We have created a problem that is not beyond our understanding but may well be beyond our resolve. We constructed a worthiness test for our species and failed it.  ",

            "answer_text": "The speed of this change is daunting.  Natural systems take time to adjust to change. Analogy:  I grow trees.  Most years in the fall the trees adapt to colder and colder temperatures as fall progresses.  It's a gradual change.  Last year we had warm temperatures through the first 3 weeks in November -- hard frost at night, 5-10 C (40-50 F) during the day.  Then it dropped to -31 C (-24F) and we had no snow.   I lost about 10% of my trees. At present large corporations by law have to act in the best financial interests of their stockholders.  Governments get voted out of power if they don't act in the interests of their people.  Our present world society does not favour altruistic behaviour on anything above a local level. To solve this problem requires global levels of cooperation, and then economically punishing decision at a local level, to encourage people to modify their behaviour. Example:  Suppose that the price of gasoline, heating oil, and fossil fuel electricity increased in price by 15% per year.   This doubles the price every 5 years.  Lot of people are going to buy a subcompact or all electric car.  I'm going to seriously look at retrofitting my house to be more energy efficient.  The price of stand-alone houses in cold climates will drop relative to well made multiple house units.  Developers redoing city cores will find more demand for high rise condos.  Cities may find it worth while to dispatch self driving minivans for commuters. After 1 doubling, renewable power and storage start to look attractive.  Retrofit hot water tanks that store a day's worth of hot water, and have smart thermostats that only operate when the electrical net has cheap power.   Air conditioning works similarly creating a supply of chilled water when power is cheap.  (Air conditioning and solar are already well synced for this.  Best solar production and max AC demand tend to go hand in hand.)  In cold climates people zone their houses:  When you get up in the morning, you block the register.  That room is unheated during the day.  After supper, you unblock so the room is warme by bed time.  This causes problems with condensation and mildew.  Tons of advice for how to reduce/eliminate this.   After two doublings people start to move out of the suburbs, back to the city.  Companies find they can more easily attract workers if they can provide on-site or nearby accommodation.  Short hop air traffic  decreases.  Bus and train gain a new popularity. There will be a new trend to chest refrigerators (about 1/5 the power use of an upright.  Cold air doesn't fall out of a chest) At 3 doublings electricity is a buck a kWh, gasoline is $25/gallon.  As a farmer, I no longer drive to Edmonton (75 km -- 50 mi) away for supplies, unless I can fill the vehicle.  Small shopping events I would instead drive to my nearest village, then take a bus to the city.  Many stores would shop for you, much as Loblaws does today.  Your order can be picked up, but not just by you.  A whole industry of micro logistics would rise.  10 people's groceries are picked up at Superstore, and move 2 miles to a consolidating warehouse.  Similar orders from Princess Auto, Lee Valley tools, and Sears.  The food was the last item to get to the warehouse, and I timed that to be there for the weekly truck to Warburg. Telecommuting becomes far more common.  School districts re-think the massively consolidated high schools, and revert to smaller schools, more closely spaced.  In the city the school bus system is abandoned.  Kids walk or bicycle to school.   Rural kids go to school only two days a week, and do the rest by distance learning. A lot of jobs become 3 days of 12hr/day so that you can charge your car enough to make the commute.  Other employers will offer plug in solar at work for charging your car.  In the countryside there is big interest in converting old trucks to run on wood gas.  Every farmer has a wood chipper, and 10% of his land is planted to fast growing trees. By three doublings the incentive for non-fossil electricity is overwhelming. Coal as a thermal power source is extinct.   The ones that exist are equipped with CO2 scrubbers -- it's the released CO2 that is taxed, not the fuel itself.  CO2 is injected into deep wells.  Most fossil fuel electrical power is now just natural gas turbines that run during the small fraction of time that none of the renewables are able to meet the demand.  15% may be too fast.  I think it would be fine for the first 5 years, but the adaptations after that get more difficult.  10% takes 7 years to double.  Perhaps 10% for the first doubling,  then 5% (14 year doubling) after that. But something like this could get us off of fossil fuel in 15 to 25 years. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I'll assume you are referring to the +2 \u00b0C threshold often cited as the requirement to avoid the worst aspects of climate change. This is a rather complex question for a number of reasons, but the short is: we don't know for sure, but quite possibly.  An important reason for the uncertainty here is an offset between when CO2 is pumped into the atmosphere and when the global temperature increases. A large number of both positive and negative feedbacks, and other cascading effects, are put into motion with an external forcing (like the input of additional CO2 into the atmosphere), and this takes time to propagate through the system. Therefore, even if we magically and instantaneously stopped all human sources of CO2 generation, the planet would still warm further, likely for a number of decades. We're fast approaching (possibly past) the 1 \u00b0C mark, with a current rate of warming of nearly .2 \u00b0C per decade. So even if we stopped all CO2 production (which, let's face it, is impossible right now), we would still be cutting it a little close for comfort to that threshold. Further additions of CO2 (which are inevitable at this point in time) will increase the amount of time for warming, and therefore increase the final absolute temperature. I personally think, barring the active removal of CO2 from the atmosphere or some form of geo-engineering on a planet-wide scale, we will inevitably pass the 2 \u00b0C threshold, even if we haven't at this exact moment. There is too much inertia in the world's reliance on fossil fuels, and even if we got our %#$@ together, we wouldn't be able to stop it in time. So in a sense, I would say we have likely passed the point of no return to avoid that threshold. That being said, a +2 \u00b0C world will be exponentially more manageable than +3 or +4 or anything else higher, so we shouldn't simply give up on it. ",

Earth 'Locked Into' Temperatures Not Seen in 2 Million Years Keep in mind what \u201clocked in\u201d means in this case is that even with zero fossil fuel emissions tomorrow, the climate will still warm until a new equilibrium range is reached. It is too late to solve AGW with reductions in fossil fuel emissions alone. We waited too long to address it. This does not mean we cant reverse AGW. I know of at least 6 ways we can do that including a conservative plan I developed myself. Scott Strough's answer to Can the global climate change be reversed or halted? All the options for AGW reversal require carbon sequestration as well as emissions reductions. The most useful and least costly do that in the topsoil making process, something we need anyway to grow food. ",

            "answer_text": "We can bury our heads in the sand because you know, there's gonna be a lot more of it by the end of the century, and use incomplete arguments to make ourselves feel better about torching the planet! For example, we can use time scales to our advantage and say things that strike at the heart of our indolent brains like the current CO2 concentrations are lower than what they have been for 98% of the last 1,000,000,000 years. The good thing is that you don't even need to fact-check this one to see how empty it is. Let's use primates as a proxy. Primates have been around for roughly 50,000,000 years or 5% of the last billion years so hey, it's not as if protohumans lived 100% or their collective lives in a carbon-rich atmosphere like some people tend to insinuate. We can go a step further and consider two more important things. The first is that while some our ancestors lived through periods where atmospheric carbon concentrations were higher than what they are now, they didn't sprawl over the entire globe like we do and forest cover, which provides shading and a bunch of other ecological services that make life more tolerable on a hotter planet, was much much larger. Second, higher as in over 400-ish ppm doesn't mean 8,000, the natural carbon cycle is much slower and primates have evolved in carbon concentrations that changed slowly. Civilization is 6,000 years old (wait for it: 0.0006% of the last billion years) and the fact that carbon dioxide concentrations have been higher for much of the past billion years means nothing about its survivability in a rapidly warming world since it has never existed in its current form under these conditions. We can also tell only half the story and mention that there have been ice ages during periods when CO2 concentrations were in the thousands and forget about the most reputable scientific agencies in the world have to say about that. While climate sensitivity, which is what the climate science illiterates talk about when they mention things like linearity or lack of it between carbon dioxide concentrations and temperatures is not completely understood, nobody ever said that CO2 was the only thing driving the climate. There's a near-perfect coincidence between solar minimums, ice ages and these carbon-heavy atmospheres that are commonly used as a reason for doing nothing by self-proclaimed wise guys.  Now I can feel the wrath of the denier saying that it's the Sun's fault! Not so, we can measure that too and the variations in solar intensity do not explain the current warming trend. Don't trust me, trust NASA. You can also choose to believe the undying hordes of internet cockroaches who keep on using the same empty counterarguments.  We could also grill some marshmallows over the burning remnants of civilization and find comfort in the fact that in the past, no matter how unfriendly the climate became, it always ended up cooling down. I'm just happy that the average human life expectancy is in the 100,000 range (the timescale it takes for Mother Nature to chill) and that I don't live in Bangladesh or Indonesia or some other part of the world that is taking the brunt of the punch. Better yet, we could completely ignore tipping points by saying that they don't exist, just because they don't happen to fit into our personal vision of how the world should work. If science doesn't serve our purpose, well too bad for science. Nevermind that excessive carbon dioxide concentrations harm plants rather than promote their growth, let's just focus on the narrow reality of it being a life-giving gas. The desert belt will expand? We'll just move agriculture up north where the soil is dirt poor (ha!) and blast it with ridiculous amounts of petrochemicals and keep on getting uber harvests year after year ad infinitum. Anyway, my point is that what you can do about global warming is to get your facts straight and do the world a favour by crushing the goblins of denialism and exposing them for the fake, dishonest and ill-informed abominations that they are. Also, use the term denier, because by now, if you call yourself a skeptic, you're either in the process of \"unskepticizing\" or you're just flat-out insincere. The sophisticated denier will often use the climate sensitivity argument to somehow introduce the notion of uncertainty in the conversation and justify full-blown distrust of the entire climate science enterprise, but the issue of climate sensitivity is meshed with that of rate of change and the rapid rise in CO2 concentrations of the previous decades is currently having a drunk bar fight with the ridiculously massive thermal inertia of the atmosphere. Drink the electrolyte Kool-aid if you want, but the hangover is just around the corner.  Tipping points? I call that a methane burp ... lol! ",

The included link removed (dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10222) Answer to new question: Yes, we've passed the point of no return. *** Answer to old question: There is more than one tipping point. We've already crossed some, we are currently crossing some now, and we will cross even more in the future. Notably, some tipping points can be reversed easily while others are more difficult to recross. For instance, some tipping points are easy to reverse but it will take decades or centuries before the opportunity to reverse them occurs. Other tipping points are permanent, such as whether we can avoid all the effects of climate change (too late to avoid them all). So then, what's the big deal? If we've already set up a positive feedback loop by raising lake temperatures and triggered greater natural emissions of methane, then haven't we permanently lost the initiative? No, we have lost some of the initiative as each minuscule tipping point could possibly cut someone's life short, tragically, because extreme weather patterns (like F5 tornados) are really dangerous and each tipping point we cross makes them slightly, ever so more likely to occur. With our remaining initiative we can still mitigate: we can slow the rate of our growing emissions, and the increasing natural rate our rate is worsening. We can also reduce the total amount of annual emissions. We also need to adapt to climate change. The more we mitigate and adapt, the more lives will be saved. It's that simple. ",

Now mind you, that doesn't mean we can't still make it change less, or eventually change back, it's just at this point it is basically already changing, and anything we do will have a real slow effect on it. Climate is like a really big freight train. Take \u201cyour foot off the gas\" and it's going to keep on coasting down the tracks for a long time. Slam on the breaks in full emergency stop mode, it's still going to slide a good half-mile before it stops. Well, climate change is a car on the tracks. If we'd started back when scientists first began warning us, we could have gradually slowed down and stopped before we hit it. If we waited,and put everything in to it like a decade ago, we still could have stopped before we hit that car - though everything in the train would be shoved about by the panic stop. As it is, though, we are going to plow through that car. We might come to a stop a half-mile, mile later, and then be able to slowly back up, but that car is scrap metal, no matter what we now do. ",

The glass is either half-full, or we're dead.\" What I mean by that is, either the global community shapes up fast, and so massive scale efforts are begun and sustained, or else unity and strength of purpose never materialize, and only halting and sporadic actions are taken. In the first case there will be bad effects from climate change, but the major story will still be one of folks and governments around the world banding together and taking strong principled action and overcoming a colossal challenge. The glass will be half full. That seems to be the message of the latest IPCC report--that it's bad right now, but if we don't act soon in a concerted way appropriate to the scale of the problem, it's very soon going to get so very much worse. What happens in the other scenario doesn't require much explanation... If we do not find and stick to a global, mutual and effective framework for halting and then reducing emissions to zero, we're dead. Or, at least, the climate enters a period of self-reinforcing feedback that causes famines, forest fires, extreme precipitation events, heat waves, ecosystem collapses, resource wars, mass extinctions, reactionary geoengineering projects, and yeah, that's a pretty empty-looking glass.

Think of this question not in terms of certainty but in terms of insurance. You don't buy auto insurance because you know you are going to have an accident; you buy it because you know you might have an accident. Insurance companies charge male drivers under age 25 more because they are more likely to have accidents. You there is a point of no return, it's very likely that we will not realize it until after we've passed it. Hindsight has much more clarity than foresight. While no one may be able to answer your question with clarity, we all can learn a lot about prudence and likely outcomes by watching the behavior of the insurance industry. Finally, right action is not dictated by outcomes but by good and moral judgment based on the best information we have available. A better question might be, \"What is the best thing to do now based upon our current understanding?\" ",

In reality, the earth was once at a higher atmospheric carbon than we are now and so there is evidence that it can and will correct itself. The bad news is that when the atmospheric carbon is at such a high level, it would be very difficult to sustain human life. Environmentalists are not trying to save the earth, the earth will be fine no matter what we do to mess it up. The earth is just a rock floating around in space with some remarkable properties that make human existence possible. Environmentalists are trying to save humanity by making sure the earth remains livable. We want humans to thrive, and we believe that people are smart enough to not mess up this good thing we have here. So, yes there is likely a point of no return with climate change. Not for the earth that measures time in billions of years, but for humanity that could find themselves with no where to live. ",

There's 410 ppm CO2 (instead of nature's intended 280\u2013300 for this geo time period). Things are set in motion and we're all gonna die (just kidding, I hope)! Unless we become the advanced type 1 civilization capable of harnessing the vast amounts of non fossil energy necessary to just fix the problem. Returning the ppm back to about 300 should do the trick. We do that by transitioning from fossil fuels via advanced nuclear, by building a global grid, and for the best distribution of hundreds of thousands of square miles of solar and wind. The global grid enables much needed global economic growth necessary to build desalination plants needed to water a continent's worth of the proper plants that sequester the excess CO2 into new and better soils. It's really quite simple to reverse this first tipping point. ",

If they do not support the massive expansion of nuclear power they are not serious about the theory that human C02 emissions are harmful. As for how a massive expansion of nuclear power could be achieved - it can only really be achieved by radical deregulation. Government regulations do not improve safety (quite the contrary) and vastly increase the costs of nuclear power by essentially blocking the most efficient designs. ",

Both are already happening. Based on the current occurrence of both phenomena, we\u2019re probably on the road to extinction in less than nine years. Neither problem can be solved by super-strategies to capture carbon out of the atmosphere or build super-machines to bring on global dimming. And there are numerous other feedback loops in operation. In the meantime, we\u2019re already hard pressed to keep food production up enough to meet the demands of all 7.5 billion of us. With climate-driven crop failures, we\u2019re very much between a rock and a hard place. The scientist most associated with dire predictions, Dr. Guy McPherson, has hung up his laptop on all of this. He\u2019s retired from Facebook, he\u2019s no longer hosting his popular podcast series, and he\u2019s seen no need to update his climate news website. He explains all this in an August Youtube. ",

That would be an extinction event for most life that has evolved in the current climate. One of these feedbacks would be the sudden release of methane hydrates from a warmer ocean, releasing gigatons of methane into the atmosphere. That scenario was part of the Permian extinction[1]. Another feedback is the melting of permafrost, and the subsequent decay of all the frozen vegetation, releasing additional methane and CO2. These feedback effects are already occurring[2], but nobody really knows where the tipping point might be for a thermal runaway. We hope it\u2019s not close.

It is almost certain that we have perturbed the climate, that it will be off balance for several centuries before finding a new \u201cnormal\u201d. What that normal, if one is ever found, will be likely depends on how much and how long greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere. And that is something that we, humanity, can still affect. The more and the faster that we can reduce them, the better our chances become of ending up with a climate in which we can survive. ",

Oil and coal running out in 50 years or so will help with emissions, as will natural gas in 150, but by then it might be too late for us. At that point, unless the warming has triggered enough of a feedback loop to become runaway, the natural processes will continue moving the planet back to the period of glaciation than the Holocene has briefly interrupted.
