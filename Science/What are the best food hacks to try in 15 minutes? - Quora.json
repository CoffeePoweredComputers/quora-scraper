I have been trying for awhile without great result. Maybe I have to take cooking classes in Summer. Well, you can cook rice for 15 minutes or less. Let me try. Put two eggs at the same time when you want to cook the rice and both are going to be cooked at the same time. There you go. Your dinner is ready. This can be a useful hack for the college students. It\u2019s halal. If you are not a Muslim then you can order takeaway. Or any halal takeaway. This is only my opinion, as I don\u2019t like takeaways nor any fast food. I like homemade food! Fast food make my wit grow mouldy. Good taste is not into my dictionary; as long as I have something to eat. Something to keep me going. Every little helps.  Trying to figure out the theory of the Big Bang\u2026.  Good luck!! Mwanandeke Kindembo ",
