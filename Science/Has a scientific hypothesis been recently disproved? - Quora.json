            "answer_text": "Yes, the conservation of angular momentum hypothesis has been disproved: In the angular momentum equation L = r x p, which one of the remaining variables\u2019 magnitudes is correctly conserved when the magnitude of the radius changes? J.H. Mandlbaur, Baur Research CC, 201 Republic Road, Randburg, South Africa Abstract: Both angular momentum and momentum are generally accepted by scientists to be conserved values, and both of these variables are contained within the equation L = r x p (variables are as defined in the reference work). Assuming that the implied rotation occurs around a fixed central point, the magnitudes of angular momentum and momentum cannot both be conserved when the magnitude of the radius changes. The generally accepted principle is that the magnitude of the momentum must change in order to conserve angular momentum. However, it is logically proven that it is the magnitude of the component of momentum perpendicular to the radius that must be conserved. Introduction: While working on a project that did not achieve the results predicted, I discovered this oversight within the laws of physics. Proof: For the equation L = r x p1, assuming that the implied rotation occurs around a fixed central point which we will refer to as the center of rotation. We also refer to the vector r as the radius. Premise 1: There is a force at all times directed from the point mass along the radius toward the center of rotation (centripetal force). Premise 2: A change in the magnitude of the radius is conducted by altering the magnitude of this force. Premise 3: There can be no component of this force perpendicular to the radius. Premise 4: In order to affect the magnitude of the component of momentum perpendicular to the radius, one must apply a parallel component of force (Newton\u2019s first law). Deduction: A change in the magnitude of the radius cannot affect the magnitude of the component of momentum perpendicular to the radius. Conclusion: In the equation L = r x p, assuming that the implied rotation occurs around a central point, it is the cross product of momentum (x p) element of the equation that must be conserved when the magnitude of the radius changes.

            "answer_text": "The general answers given here by others are correct as far as they go, but I think that our questioner would like some examples. Now, the question is rather vague. In particular, we do not know how recent our examples should be. I am going to take the liberty of considering the last 130 years since Classical Physics came into question as \"recent\", but proceeding up into the last twenty years. We will pass over earlier examples, such as Ptolemy's Heliocentric hypothesis, and the development of non-Euclidean geometry, contrary to the ancient hypothesis, still maintained by Kant in the 18th century, that Euclidean geometry is the only one possible. Also caloric, the hypothetical substance of heat, and phlogiston, the hypothetical substance of combustion, and so on. Newton, who famously said in the 17th century, \"Hypotheses non fingo,\" \"I don't make hypotheses,\" made the hypotheses of absolute space and time, later developed into the Luminiferous Ether, and of gravity as a force. Absolute space and time were exploded in Special Relativity 1905, and gravity as a force in General Relativity in 1915. Eddington's hypothesis of the Steady-State Universe was exploded by General Relativity and the discovery of the expansion of the Universe. Einstein attempted to accommodate the Steady-State hypothesis with his own hypothesis of a Cosmological Constant, which he later said was the worst mistake of his life. Eugenics was exploded by the Nazi experiment and others. It turns out that we do not agree on what changes to humanity could be counted as improvements, and we do not dare to leave such decisions to scientists or politicians or the general public. We especially cannot make the practice of eugenics compulsory without disastrous consequences to human rights. The Lamarckian hypothesis of inheritance of acquired characteristics became dogma under Stalin, and was not replaced by genetics in the Soviet Union until after his death. The hypothesis that Mayan writing was entirely ideographic or logographic (signs standing for ideas or words, but not sounds) was exploded by the work of Knorosov. Creationism has been exploded every day since geology became a science, long before the idea of evolution took hold (even before Darwin), but believers don't care. They keep coming up with new hypotheses, such as Flood Geology and Intelligent Design and God changing the speed of light and various Conspiracy Theories about all of the scientists in the world, on the hypothesis that accepting science means going to Hell. The Bell Inequality for particles in entangled states means that we have to give up any notion of \"local hidden variables\". The prediction of the decay of the proton from the Standard Model of Quantum Mechanics was invalidated by experiment. The hypothesis that neutrinos are massless was invalidated by the discovery of neutrino oscillations. The hypothesis that the Earth's surface is too solid to move made the obvious connection between both the shapes and the species in Africa and South America appear to be bogus. It was exploded by the discovery of mid-ocean volcanic ridges, and paleomagnetism, leading to plate tectonics. The hypotheses of singularities inside black holes or at the beginning of the Cosmos have been shown to be artifacts of doing calculations in General Relativity with no consideration for Quantum Mechanics. Various theories of quantum gravity suggest various structures in the core of a black hole, limited by the principle that no particle can be confined in a space smaller than its wavelength. The hypothesis of the False Vacuum enables us to talk about physics before the Big Bang, with vast numbers of universes bubbling up. Dark matter exploded the hypothesis that we knew what matter was, and how much there is. Numerous hypotheses about the nature of dark matter have been exploded, and we still do not know what it is. The hypothesis of the Hubble Constant being constant was exploded by the discovery of the accelerating expansion of the Universe in 1999, with the new hypothesis of dark energy. Does that answer the question? Are any of those recent enough for you? There are many more if you need them. ",

            "answer_text": "loads of them! Let me give a glimpse! We have five senses; Not to say we\u2019re all instant superheroes, but scientists today have determined that we have up to 20 senses, including thermoception (temperature) and equilibrioception (balance). Drink 8 glasses of water a day: The 8 glasses a day is an overly generalized rule, much like the 2,000-calorie diet. How much water you need depends on the temperature of your environment, your activity level, your size, and other variables. Water flows the opposite way in the different hemisphere: Water doesn\u2019t flow down the toilet in different directions in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The Coriolis effect (the curvature of winds, currents, and other bits moving across Earth\u2019s surface due to the rotation on its axis) is most often cited for the supposed reversed flow, but systems have to be massive for the Earth\u2019s rotation to have any effect. The best example is a hurricane or typhoon. Bats can't see: Bats aren\u2019t blind. Most smaller bat species do primarily use echolocation (sound waves) to find their way around, but all bats have working eyes. Larger bats even rely on their night vision as opposed to echolocation. Bulls are driven mad by red: Bulls don\u2019t charge a matador\u2019s cape because it\u2019s red; they see red as another shade of gray. The matador\u2019s taunting and flag waving is what causes bulls to charge. Drinking alcohol warms you up: In a sad blow to everyone who lives in the far north, booze won\u2019t really make you feel warmer. (Now, tingly? That\u2019s another story.) Drinking alcohol dilates (expands) blood vessels, bringing a higher quantity of warm blood to near-surface skin. Your body temperature actually lowers due to heat transfer between shallow vessels and the cold air. Blood in your veins is blue: The deoxygenated blood returning to the heart through the veins is not truly blue. (It\u2019s actually a darker red.) School diagrams show veins in blue for clarity, but the blue color for veins actually comes from light hitting our skin and scattering into the wavelength on the color spectrum we notice as blue. Sunflowers follow the sun across the sky:Sunflowers don\u2019t follow the sun across the sky but point East all day. Before the famous flower heads appear, though, the baby buds follow the sun to set the soon-to-be flowers in the right direction. Plants can be smart too. The tongue has specific taste zones: The tongue doesn\u2019t actually have specific receptor areas for bitter, sour, salty, and sweet flavors. In fact, there is a fifth taste (umami, for savory/meaty flavors) and all zones of the tongue can sense all flavors. Being in a vacuum causes our eyes to pop out: A human body or any organism won\u2019t comically explode if put into a vacuum. Rather, the lack of oxygen would cause you to lose consciousness and die after just a few minutes. Hope you enjoy the bunch of scientific flaws! ",

Every time someone does an experiment, they formulate a hypothesis, and then conduct tests to see whether they can falsify that hypothesis. Those are disproven far more often than they're proven. We have to cull through a lot of possibilities to determine the right answer. The thing is, the hypotheses that get tested on a daily basis are probably far more specialized and less interesting than what you're probably thinking of.  People hypothesize that a certain fiber will exhibit lower breaking tendency in a certain plastic at a certain temperature, or that rats injected with a particular hormone at a particular level is more likely to develop cancer, or that a certain turbine design will yield an improvement in efficiency.   Walk into the scientific building of any graduate school on any weekday and you'll see hypotheses being disproved.  That happening is a basic part of the scientific method. ",
