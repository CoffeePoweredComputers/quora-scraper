            "answer_text": "Sure. Evaporate the water. As the concentration of the salt ions increases, the salt will precipitate out as solid salt again. \u2014\u2014\u2014- Edit added after reading some other responses that try to tell you that dissolving is not a chemical reaction. In a salt, it is a reaction. If you are dissolving a molecular solid like sugar then it is more of a physical process. The reverse reaction for the salt is called a precipitation reaction and all salts will precipitate if their ion concentration is high enough that the reaction quotient Q is higher than the equilibrium constant Ksp. When Q>K the equilibrium will go back to reactants so as you remove the water, the salt will precipitate back out of solution. Some salts, like AgCl are very sparingly soluble and will precipitate out of even quite dilute solutions while other salts, like NaCl are quite soluble and will only precipitate out of very concentrated solutions. No matter what the salt, it is a precipitation equilibrium that occurs once you have some precipitate and the solution in contact with each other. ",

            "answer_text": "Salt and water isn't a reaction. It is a physical change/process. If it was a reaction, most likely it would be hard to reverse, but since it is only a mixture by process of physical chnage, it can be separated by many things, easiest of which is evaporation. In chemisty terms; H2O(l) + NaCl(s) \u2192 H2O(l) + NaCl(aq) The chemical structures have not changed, it is merely the state of salt that has changed. Easily reversible. ",
