            "answer_text": "Nicolas Rashevsky wrote a two volume set called Mathematical Biophysics, Physico Mathematical foundations of Biology. It is an old book. (first published in 1938 updated in 1960), but comprehensive. Rashevsky covers everything from modeling cell metabolism and division to nerve conduction and psychology. The mathematics are not too difficult, (nothing beyond beginning calculus), and he presents the theories and assumptions in detail. I would also read some of Ludwig von Bertallanfly's books and papers.   The French catastrophe theorist, Rene Thom, wrote a book called \"Structural Stability and Morphogenesis\"  which specifically describe how topology can be used to model biological processes ( especially embryogenesis). I am sure more modern resources exist. Unfortunately, I am unaware of them  ",
