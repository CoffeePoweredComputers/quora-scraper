            "answer_text": "COROT-7b.  Orbiting roughly 60 times closer to its star than Earth, this planet is a literal interpretation of hell. With surface temperatures ranging from 2,300K-3,100K, not even rock can remain as a solid. Oceans of lava bathe the day-side of this planet in a volcanic hell not unlike what Mustafar may look like. One year on this planet is as short as 20 hours. Imagine that. If you were able to survive the heat and enjoy a drink at the foot of the planet-wide ocean of lava, you\u2019d be able to celebrate a birthday every 20 hours. Speaking of days, because the planet is so close to the star, one side is permanently locked in the blast furnace of the star while the other is plunged into the black of eternal night. The temperature difference between night and day may be as much as 2000Ks. Where oceans of lava may bathe the day, the nightside may much resemble the night-side of Mercury, with pockets of ice hidden deep in the safety of night. Alternatively, if the tidal pull from the star is enough (it probably is) the night side may be covered in volcanic hell as well. Jupiter\u2019s moon Io comes to mind. Not exactly the lame H20 oceans we enjoy on Earth. What little atmosphere exists on this planet consists of wisps of vaporized clouds of iron, silicon, titanium, magnesium, potassium, etc. These elements condense to form a very alien and unpleasant form of 2,000 degree rain, however that may look like. The heat difference from day and night probably combines to make a pretty powerful jetstream, but the atmosphere being so thin, it probably wouldn\u2019t feel all that much. Still, I can imagine hurricanes of molten iron forming over the twilight zones of this planet. What a world this place is. 2MASS J119\u20131137 AB If you thought COROT-7b was weird, wait till you meet the binary system of 2MASS J1119\u20131137 AB. Where COROT-7b was nice and snug to its home star, this couplet of 4-Jupiter mass planets wanders aimlessly through space starless, but with each other for company.  You see, it turns out they actually orbit each other at a distance roughly comparable to the asteroid belt. While not technically moons to each other, I\u2019d say these two qualify as the first bona-fide binary planet discovered. Their planet-like mass of 4 Jupiter masses strengthens the case for them to be bona-fide binary planets. After all, we\u2019ve detected hundreds of planets heavier than these two, and whether or not they orbit stars or how they formed, they still deserve a mention in this post. NGC 4349\u2013127 b Few exoplanets have been found orbiting high-mass stars, but planet NGC 4349\u2013127 b is exactly one of those few planets. The star, currently a class M bright giant at 3.9 solar masses, was easily somewhere between 5\u20136 solar masses when accounting for high-mass loss rates associated with evolved stars in this mass range. When on the main-sequence, the star was likely of class B, probably somewhere between B4-B6. This would put it slightly brighter and more massive than the stars comprising the Pleiades\u2019 famous Seven Sisters, pictured below. Imagine being on a planet orbiting a star of such grandness.  Today, as a bright giant, NGC 4349\u2013127 emits between 4,500\u20135,000 times more light than the Sun. The planet, a 19-Jupiter mass gas giant, orbits slightly beyond where Mars would be in the solar system at roughly 2.38 AUs. Despite this relatively far distance, it receives around 1,000 times the amount of light the Earth does. The equivalent temperature would likely be high, probably over 1500K. Any moons orbiting this planet would be covered in lava. If an Earth-like planet were to orbit this star, it would have to be near 70 times farther than the Earth is to the Sun, or roughly in the middle of the Kuiper Belt. Eventually, when this star reaches the tip of the AGB, it will likely be north of 20,000 times brighter than the Sun and perhaps 600 times the size. Orbiting at just 2.38 AUs, there is a more than even chance the planet will be engulfed by the expanding star before it goes out.  HD 20782 b If you thought any of the above planets were strange, wait till you meet this one. This planet is a 1.8 Jupiter mass gas giant whose average distance from the Sun is around 1.4 AUs, or slightly less than Mars. Not extreme in the sense of other planets we have seen so far. But what\u2019s crazy about this planet is the extreme eccentricity. At an eccentricity of 0.97, this planet has the highest known eccentricity of any planet we have found so far, and is unlikely to be exceeded by much. To see how extreme this orbit really is, Halley\u2019s comet has an eccentricity of 0.96, or slightly less than this thing, which is a super-Jupiter by the way.  Imagine if our own Jupiter was this badly behaved? If in our Solar System, its crazy orbit would range from 3 times closer to the Sun than Mercury to 3 times farther than Earth in the winter. Temperatures would range from below -150 celsius in winter to north of 1,500 celsius in summer. A moon of this planet would see its surface melted molten in the summer, frozen in a freeze worse than the deepest of Antarctica, and relatively Earth-like in the spring and the fall. Inhabitants of a moon here would really cherish the term \u201cspring break.\u201d I can\u2019t even imagine what the weather would be like. For those looking to get four full seasons, here is your dream paradise. KELT-9b Two planets above, we met NGC 4349\u2013127b, which orbits a former B-class star at a relatively toasty distance of 2.38 AUs. But imagine what the poor planet would be like orbiting where COROT-7b is? Look no further than KELT-9b.  The host star, HD 195689, is a B9V main-sequence star with a surface temperature of 10,500K and a total mass of 2.8 Solar masses. With a luminosity some 60 times that of the Sun, an Earth-like planet would need to orbit between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to support water. But this planet, a roughly 4 Jupiter mass gas giant, orbits the star some 50 times closer than the Earth does the Sun, completing a quick orbit in just under 35 hours. Do I need to make anything clearer? This place is hot. Very hot. With an equivalent temperature of 4600K, this is hotter than the surfaces of many K-stars and all M-stars. Our own Sun has a temperature of 5700K. This planet is closer to the Sun in temperature than it is to the Earth. Such a world is likely evaporating, a constant stream of gas shrouding the planet in a global tail not unlike a giant comet. Ungodly elements like silicates, iron, titanium oxide, magnesium, aluminium, copper, etc probably lace the atmosphere of this world. Imagine a world where hurricanes are made of molten aluminum and titanium oxide? Because this planet is so close to its star, it is almost certain to be tidally locked, like the moon is to the Earth. The night having such a large temperature differential, winds exceeding 10,000mph likely charge across the planet, rippling through clouds banks of vaporized silicates. If one was on this world, they could just stand still and reach hypersonic velocities. If God were to build a planet specifically for hell, this planet would likely be it. PSR J1719\u20131438b Picture a Jupiter-sized planet composed entirely of diamond. Planet J1719\u20131438b was once a solar-mass star orbiting a class O-star (PSR J1719\u20131438) relatively closely. Class O stars are extremely violent, especially when they get old, as they usually evolve into supergiants then go kaboom as supernovae.   When the O-star evolved, it likely ballooned into a red supergiant some 1,000 times larger than the Sun. Fusing hydrogen to helium, then helium to carbon, neon, oxygen, silicon, then iron, it burned through its fuel quickly, then went kaboom in a giant supernova that shone brighter than the entire galaxy. The other star, orbiting too close to the supernova, likely became stripped of its stellar envelope, becoming a white dwarf at a young age for its mass and temperature. Eventually, the white dwarf spiralled into its current distance of 0.005 AUs, likely through tidal forces and friction probably through the magnetic field, radiation, and supernova debris. Orbiting some 200 times closer to the newborn pulsar than the Earth does the Sun, the white dwarf screamed around the pulsar every two hours. Over many years, the newly formed pulsar\u2019s radiation likely eroded the white dwarf over a period of many years, stripping it of degenerate mass until the total mass of the white dwarf was a little more than that of Jupiter, hence the planet we know today.  As most white-dwarfs are composed of degenerate carbon-neon-oxygen, the planet/former white-dwarf is likely a very large diamond some 20 times denser than Jupiter yet 1.2 times the mass. I can\u2019t even imagine what that world would look like, but if I was ever in desperate need for a diamond, that planet would be the place to go. Imagine proposing to the honey of your dreams with a diamond ring the size of Jupiter? Some planet that I\u2019d definitely like to pay a visit or two, sans the inevitable side-effect of acute pulsar-borne radiation poisoning. Honorary mention: Kepler-1625 b I (that\u2019s no moon, it\u2019s a Neptune!) Hey, no moons allowed! Okay, so this one technically isn\u2019t a planet, and isn\u2019t confirmed yet, but with four-sigma confidence, it is very likely to be confirmed in the near future. In summer 2017, astronomers announced the potential detection of a moon orbiting the planet Kepler-1625 b. The planet, a gas giant weighing in at 10 times the mass of Jupiter, is a behemoth orbiting close to where the Earth would be in the Solar System, but that is besides the point. The moon, potentially the first ever exomoon, is the same size and mass as Neptune. Imagine a Neptune-sized moon? Forget the Galilean moons. This thing would dwarf everything we know of in our Solar System while still being a second-class lowly satellite.  Of course, with a parent planet 10 times heavier than even Jupiter, the likelihood of larger satellites is greater, but still. I\u2019d like to imagine what a Neptune-sized moon would look like in the night sky. Perhaps it even has its own moons and rings to boot. Rebel base overkill? In any case, the Empire would have a hard time building a space station to match the size of this thing. These are some of the planets I know of. Truth is often stranger than fiction as you can see. With so many other planets out there, I can\u2019t wait to see what else Mother Nature has in store for us. ",

            "answer_text": "Some exoplanets orbit so close to their stars that they are hot enough to glow in visible light. Like Kepler-78b - Wikipedia \u2014 a planet a little bit larger and more massive than the Earth. It orbits every 8.5 hours about 2 solar radii from its star, a star with a radius about 3/4 that of the Sun. Its surface temperature is something like 2300 K - 3100 K, as hot as an incandescent light bulb\u2019s filament, and likely hot enough to make its surface an ocean of lava. Since this planet is likely tidally locked, only the daytime side would have a liquid surface. On the nighttime side, it would be bitter cold, since rock is a good thermal insulator. Using a very rough figure of 1 W / m / K, and using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, I find a night-side temperature of around 8 K. But the star\u2019s stellar wind could heat it there also, even if not nearly as much as the day side gets heated. How it got there is a mystery. It\u2019s too hot to have formed there, and it\u2019s rather difficult for a relatively small planet to migrate inward. But Jovian planets can do so, and when close enough, they could get stripped of their volatile components, leaving behind rocky cores. (Stars Can Strip Gas Giants Naked). So that had likely happened here. ",
