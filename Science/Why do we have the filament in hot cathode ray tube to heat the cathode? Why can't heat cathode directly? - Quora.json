            "answer_text": "For heating cathode directly, you will probably connect it in an electric circuit. Right? And what happens next? The free electron in the cathode, under the influence of two terminals of the cell, starts flowing from -ve to +ve end. And the electrons which were free earlier are busy travelling in the circuit, hence you will not be able to emit any electrons from the cathode. Now when you heat the cathode indirectly, you do two things: Cathode is not in a complete circuit. Thus being a cathode it has surplus electrons but they are not going anywhere. They are stationary.You provide heat for emission of those electrons from the cathode.Hope it helps. Looking forward for further corrections and ideas. ",
