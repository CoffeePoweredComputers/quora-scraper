            "answer_text": "Made using natural crystals, Swarovski beads are man-made gems that are cut using an electric cutting machine for perfect finesse and luminosity. Swarovski beads are made using high-quality natural elements such as glass, quartz, sand, minerals, etc. and are known to come in different sizes, specifications and from different sources.  A superior work of art, Swarovski beads are used by jewelers for crafting various jewelry pieces owing to its clarity, shine and beauty. However, owing to the large scale use of swarovski beads in jewelry-making, many swarovski bead suppliers have started to imitate and selling duplicate beads. As crystals such as Swarovski beads are used to create precious jewelry pieces by combining with different gems, gold, silver, etc. it is really important to check the purity of a Swarovski bead before making it a part of jewelry piece. This is essential so that an imitated bead does not break or fade the charm of the final jewelry piece. To check if a Swarovski bead is pure and luminous as it should be, one should subject the bead under a jeweler\u2019s glass to check the fine details of the crystal from which a Swarovski bead is made. A swarovski bead can be considered absolutely genuine and pure only if there are no bubbles present inside the Swarovski crystal and possess greater luminosity than other crystals. Also, to check the purity of a complete batch of Swarovski beads, one should check the sizes of all the crystals in a batch. As Swarovski crystals are made using machine, every crystal should be of similar size and cut.  One more identification of purity lies in the color of a Swarovski crystal bead. The crystals coming from the same color family will look completely identical without any light or dark tone. This is an important identification for checking the purity of a Swarovski crystal bead as most imitators find it hard to bring similar color to all the crystals. These are some of the identifications which can be used to check the purity of a crystal just by having a look at it. When it comes to careful examination to check the purity, one must check the surface of a Swarovski bead. An imitated Swarovski bead will have several scratches or will possess an oily texture. If you find that a bead has scratches or an oily texture, that bead is bound to be of impure origins. To ensure receiving only the purest forms of Swarovski beads, one must source the beads only from reliable Swarovski suppliers. Swarovski beads in Australia can be ordered from a number of online portals and websites of jewelry suppliers such as Beads Venue. Buying from an established supplier saves an individual or jewelry designer from shocks received on identifying that a gem or bead is not original or is impure. Also, purchasing Swarovski beads from established supplier ensures that a bead possesses perfect shine and cut, promising a greater level of finesse and elegance in the final jewelry piece. ",
