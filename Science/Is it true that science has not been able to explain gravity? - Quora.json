            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give one example of something that has gravity and is not detectable by science: The stars and galaxies that have passed beyond the event horizon of our universe can no longer ever be seen nor heard from again. It is true that science has not been able to explain gravity. At least contemporary phenomenological science cannot explain it. To explain gravity we need a theory that addresses underlying reality in the physical vacuum and even deeper levels of metaphysical reality. Having made such a statement, let me then proceed to explain gravity. Gravity is not a point-to-point effect as it were an accumulation of a virtually infinite number of particle to particle interactions where each massive point, each atom, each crystal were attracting each other one throughout the universe. This is unthinkable and improbable. Rather, gravity is a field effect where, despite the Newtonian formulation of gravity, actually, the entire mass forms a field, albeit a quite complex one, as a unified whole, which we may term a \u201cunified gravitational field.\u201d How then is this \u201cgravitational information\u201d conveyed to all points downstream throughout the entire universe, as we know to be the property of gravity? This is indeed via the ubiquitous \u201cinformation field.\u201d Thus, not the gravitational force field itself nor the curved space itself nor the point-to-point particle interactions summed up \u2014 but rather a subliminal, metaphysical information field conveys the presence of the massive center along with all its vibrations, quirks, convolutions and inhomogeneities, outward through the physical vacuum to all points \u201cdownstream.\u201d Then what is it in space-time which reacts to the gravitational field, i.e. the information signal conveyed by the information field? This is the quintessential Planck-size particle occupying the lattice points of the physical vacuum, namely the phytons. These phytons, or \u201ctorsion field particles\u201d are unique in containing a metaphysical and a physical component (just like ourselves!), which can receive the signals from Logos and from the information field and transform them into a physical spin-axis orientation, somewhat like the precession of odd-number nuclei in NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). What effect does the gravitational signal have on the phytons? Phytons have three spin orientations: longitudinal, transverse, and charge. It is to the gravitational signal that the longitudinal spin orientation corresponds. The degree of alignment of the spin axes of the phyton field corresponds to the degree of intensity of the gravitational field signal. What happens when the longitudinal spin axes line up? Spatial compression is occasioned by an alignment of the phytons\u2019 spin axes in one direction, i.e. normal to the gravitational field gradient, and directed toward the massive center. When the spin axes line up, the space-time metric becomes slightly compressed, in accordance with the intensity and uniformity of the alignment of the spin axes. How does spin axis alignment manifest as compression of space-time? When the axes of spin of the phytons line up, the space can crowd in closer owing to the lessening of randomness of spin orientation, like in a crystal. Thus the space-time metric is compactified, in proportion to the intensity of the gravitational signal through the information field. How does compression of space-time cause a gravitational force? The local compression of space-time does not cause a force itself, but the gradient causes the force. Namely, when there is a gravitational potential gradient exists, it becomes energetically favorable for objects to migrate to a place of lower (negative) gravitational potential. They will naturally migrate in free fall toward the massive center. However, if the object resists that natural motion, and maintains the same radius (position), then this is going against the natural gradient, and namely requires force. Thus, a compression of space-time causes a gradient of potential, which appears as a force if one resists it. How does compression of space-time manifest as time-dilation? Because the lattice points of the space-time metric are compressed, they are now closer together. At the same time, light waves are strictly regulated in their velocity in accordance with the metric intervals of space-time. Light must cover a precise number of space-time lattice points within a certain interval of time. However, now the lattice points have been drawn closer together. Therefore, for the local space-time reference frame, the light is covering the same distance in the same time. However, viewed from outside, now the light ray has traversed a shorter distance in the same length of time. As a result, it appears that time has dilated (slowed down!) to an outside observer. This is exactly what we observe. This is an explanation of the underlying mechanism for gravitation from the standpoint of Gennady Shipov\u2019s Theory of the Physical Vacuum, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2019.

            "answer_text": "Yes. It is true. Gravity is still a very mysterious force. Gravity is indeed a force, but what kind? Is it pull or push force? It appears to be a force of attraction. Is it really so? Gravitational pressure at center of heavenly bodies is at its maximum. Yet there is no mass located at their centers. How come? gravity is emitted from an atom. What kind of force is it? It is said that gravity is a property of mass of the atom. Most of mass in the atoms is due to strong force within and between nucleons. Is gravity related to strong force? How it acts at a distance ? How does it propagate ? there is force of gravity acting between trillions of objects in the universe. if gravity propagates as waves, why are we not detecting these waves? There must be trillions of these waves crisscrossing through space. On one has detected them. It is our lack of understanding of gravity that has given birth to dark matter and dark energy. There are many forces acting within atoms. How these forces are balanced ? Are they balanced or not ? Why force of gravity is coming out of atoms? Until we understand forces acting in atoms, we cannot understand gravity and the working of the universe. ",
