It\u2019s well-informed people like you, who keep doctors like us on toes. I hope you continue your endeavour in future too. Avinash Hiremath (\u0905\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0936 \u0939\u093f\u0930\u0947\u092e\u0920) first we should understand what the term \u2018organ\u2019 means, it is only then, will we be able to understand the importance of \u2018mesentery\u2019 being labelled as an organ. In biology, an organ or viscus is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function. The main \u2018tissue\u2019 is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart, while sporadic tissues include the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Organ (anatomy) - Wikipedia Now when we label something as \u2018organ\u2019 we know that it, as a whole, performs a particular function or has a specific structure. For example, heart pumps blood across the body through various muscular tubes called arteries. Hence, if a person is facing difficulty in passage of blood to a particular part of the body, then the first organ a doctor thinks of, that might be affected or diseased, would be the \u2018Heart\u2019 or its tissue known as \u2018myocardium\u2019. Similarly, when there is difficulty in breathing then the first organ that might be diseased or affected and causing the breathing problem might be \u2018lungs\u2019 as the organ \u2018lungs\u2019 are associated with the process of respiration, and oxygenate the de-oxygenated blood. Organs are typically classified by either their specific structure or a clear function. For example, \u201cthe stomach, bladder, and kidneys are all self-contained areas of tissues that all work together to have one function,\u201d says Jennifer Whitney, a physiologist at Georgetown University. So despite the fact they have one function, they are each organ because they have discrete structures. On the other hand, substances like blood are also sometimes considered an organ because, although blood circulates throughout the body and has no specific structure, it has a unified function: to bring oxygen to other organs and circulates immune cells. And although the appendix doesn\u2019t have a specific function (that we know of), it\u2019s still considered an organ because the condition caused by its infection, known as appendicitis, affects about 5% of people. There\u2019s a vital organ in your gut you didn\u2019t know you hadHave you ever wondered what attaches your intestines to the posterior wall of the abdomen? It is a structure called \u2018MESENTERY\u2019. The research of Dr. J. Calvin Coffey, foundation chair of surgery at the University of Limerick, is reclassifying this part of the digestive system as a contiguous organ (the organ was previously thought to consist of fragmented and disparate structures). In a new study, Coffey has established the anatomy and structure of the mesentery, using images and compiling research to show that the organ's continuity can be seen only when it's exposed in a certain way.During the initial research, Dr. J. Calvin Coffey noticed in particular that the mesentery, which connects the gut to the body, was one continuous organ. Up to that it was regarded as fragmented, present here, absent elsewhere and a very complex structure. The anatomic description that had been laid down over 100 years of anatomy was incorrect. This organ is far from fragmented and complex. It is simply one continuous structureCurrently, there are 78 organs that make up 13 systems in the human body as defined by the Federative International Programme on Anatomical Terminologies (FIPAT), an international group based in Switzerland that keeps a tab on all 7,500 body parts\u2014all of which you can read through here (pdf). The mesentery is a set of tissues which is formed by the double fold of peritoneum that attaches the intestines to the posterior wall of the abdomen. The term mesentery is used for the small intestine; and mesenteric organ is sometimes used to refer to the rest of the mesentery that incorporates the mesocolon (incorporating: ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon), mesoappendix (incorporating appendix), mesosigmoid (incorporating sigmoid colon) and mesorectum (incorporating rectum). Mesentery - Wikipedia Among its functions, it carries blood and lymphatic fluid between the intestine and the rest of the body. It also maintains the position of the intestine so that it's connected with the abdominal wall without being in direct contact.That connection is key. \"Without a mesentery to keep the intestine connected, the intestine would have to attach directly to the body wall,\" as Prof Calvin Coffey has mentioned. \"It is unlikely that it (intestines) would be able to contract and relax along its entire length if it were directly in contact. It maintains the intestine in a particular conformation, 'hitched up,' so that when you stand up or walk about, it doesn't collapse into the pelvis and not function.\" Although researchers know that the mesentery plays an important role in the intestinal, vascular, endocrine, cardiovascular and immunological systems, more research is needed to determine the extent of those roles. But they do have evidence that the mesentery takes environmental signals from the intestine and orchestrates the body's response. One example is how bacteria are sampled in the lymph glands in the mesentery. In response, the glands then coordinate immune responses. The latest anatomy and structure clarifications aid not only doctors, but medical students as well.The mesentery, Coffey argues, should be considered an organ because it holds up our intestines (a discrete role or function) and has a distinct structure. \u201cIt has a beginning and an end, and in between it kind of fans out like a Chinese fan,\u201d he says, and is usually about two feet long. \"For students, it greatly simplifies the matter of the mesentery,\" Prof Calvin Coffey has mentioned. \"This was traditionally regarded as a complex field. The current anatomic model is elegant and simple and will help students understand this structure. It will also provide them with a new perspective from which to view other organs in the abdomen. For example, we now know that the mesentery and intestine intersect along the entire length of the small and large intestine, whereas previously, this was though to occur in some regions only.\" 2. Improving surgery and treatment More research will allow for better definition of the gut membrane's function, what happens when it functions abnormally and diseases that affect it. This also allows for mesenteric science to become its own field of medical study, like neurology. Up to now there was no such field as mesenteric science. Now after establishing anatomy and the structure. The next step is the function. If you understand the function you can identify abnormal function, and then you have disease. Put them all together and you have the field of mesenteric science\u2026the basis for a whole new area of scienceProf Calvin Coffey hopes that creating a better understanding of the mesentery can help with diagnosing issues and less invasive ways of assessing them. Currently, its remote location in the body means the mesentery can be accessed only radiologically or surgically. This research lays the foundation for investigating possible prescriptions and how less-invasive endoscopic procedures during a colonoscopy could map the mesentery.Adopting a universal classification like this in the medical world has benefits that extend to standardising surgical procedures, such as moving or cutting into the intestine. The mesentery extends from the duodenum, or the first part of the small intestine immediately beyond the stomach, all the way to the rectum, the final section of the large intestine.Because of this, it can factor into diseases such as Crohn's, colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or cardiovascular disease and major health concerns like diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome. The more doctors know about the exact function of the mesentery, the more measures they can take to investigate the part it plays.\"For doctors, it provides us with an opportunity to refresh our approach to many diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and others\", \"This could help in identifying the mechanisms underlying these conditions and help us in unravelling their cause and how they develop.\"There is also a counterpoint of view. There\u2019s no real benefit to defining the mesentery as a separate organ. Students may be introduced to it sooner in biology classes, Jennifer Whitney, a physiologist at Georgetown University, explained, but other than that, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Coffey, though, thinks that by defining the mesentery more concretely, it would be easier to standardize information about it, which could be used for improving abdominal surgery techniques.

            "answer_text": "\u201cDiscovery of a new human organ\u201d makes for a better headline than \u201cMesentery officially classified a single continuous organ\u201d We now have a better understanding of mesentery- due to the work of many scientists including Prof. Calvin Coffey- it\u2019s anatomy, function and it\u2019s complex role in pathophysiology of intestinal diseases. This is exactly the title of Prof. Calvin\u2019s latest paper in Lancet: The mesentery: structure, function, and role in disease . Mesentery is not some obscure structure which has suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Mesentery was first described by Leaonardo da Vinci in the 15th century and has been in anatomy textbooks for medical students for more than 150 years. Mesentery has always been described as a double fold of peritoneum and I remember that I had some trouble understanding it\u2019s anatomy during my first year of medical school. Unless you dissect the cadaver in the anatomy lab to see it for yourself, it is terribly difficult to understand it\u2019s structure based on textbook descriptions. I remember poring over several Anatomy atlases to understand what mesentery looked like. I think Netter\u2019s Atlas had the most accurate depiction.  Source: Arteries of Small Intestine Blood Supply of Small and Large Intestine from the Netter Collection. Now, the new definition makes it a bit easier for medical students to understand. What was thought of as- fragmented structures in the abdomen associated with the intestines- is now understood to be a continuous single organ with specific functions. The mesentery now ticks off enough boxes to be now classified as a full organ. This is similar to how Pluto has been reclassified as being a dwarf planet instead of a planet. - Why Pluto is No Longer a Planet - Universe Today . Pluto did not tick off enough boxes to be classified as a planet. The improved understanding of the mesentery has already been used by colorectal surgeons and gastroenterologists in their clinical practice and surgical techniques- much before the publication of this new paper. What is unfortunate is the popular spin being given to this significant information. Creating news in popular media, reducing complex medical knowledge into reductionist literature and appropriating all knowledge acquired over centuries to one single team of scientists which wrote the latest paper is in my opinion a disrespect to the thousands of scientists before them who contributed to the present understanding. Science usually takes small steps at a time rather than giant leaps. Our understanding of our world at any given time is limited by how much more we need to know. I\u2019m sure there is more work to be done in understanding Mesentery and it is a work in progress. ",
