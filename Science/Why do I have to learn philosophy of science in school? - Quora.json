            "answer_text": "I wasn\u2019t aware you HAVE to learn Philosophy of Science in school. Nonetheless, the more you learn of this subject, the better\u2026 A well-informed citizen knows: That unlike some fields, modern science largely rejects authority as an ultimate decider of questions. There are authorities, of course, but their authority is only temporary and can be overruled by evidence at any time.Modern science relies on evaluation of evidence and is self-correcting. This is one of the aspects of science that make it so often right, or at least useful.Science, especially \u201chard science,\u201d is strongly predictive. You can use Newtonian physics, for example, to predict the action of tides, and these results can be easily verfied.Scientific theories that produce no testifiable or verifiable predictions are questionable, until such a time as they can make predictions.At the same time, Philosophy of Science does posit a kind of \u201cfaith,\u201d in that it assumes the universe is predictable, regular, and subject to causation. It is useful to understand why the philosopher David Hume raised questions about these assumptions.The historical roles of Science v. Politics and Science v. Religion are rich areas of understanding\u2026 in general, both religion and politics have usually done better to leave science alone, to let it objectively evaluate evidence \u2014 which is not something people in the religion or political fields are always good at. Most of these ideas, by the way, could be picked up by closely watching Carl Sagan\u2019s version of \u201cCosmos,\u201d along with the more recent version by Neil deGrasse Tyson. But if you don\u2019t get this from popular science books (which you could read on your own) or Sagan\u2019s program, you ought to be getting it in school. And if you do understand Philosophy of Science, you should also understand the role of peer-reviewed articles, which in turn should help you understand that Climate Change is a real thing. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d be quite surprised if you have to learn it in school, assuming that school here refers to high school, but there are quite a few good reasons to promote learning at least the basics of philosophy of science: It teaches that science is a process rather than just a body of knowledge. Science isn\u2019t just about all the good answers that we came up with, but also the failures.It teaches that this process is influenced by paradigms (Kuhn), funding, personal convictions and expectations, etc. In other words: it doesn\u2019t move unidirectionally towards the \u2018truth\u2019 (which is a troublesome notion itself)It teaches how difficult it is to define what science is exactly and how to distinguish it from pseudo-science (demarcation criterium)It teaches how to evaluate the quality of scientific researchIn other words: if it succeeds in conveying the idea that science is a flawed but useful process influenced by many factors that is very hard to define, that class has been successful. This can avoid things like: \u201cIt\u2019s not true. It\u2019s just a theory!\u201d\u201cNewton was wrong!\u201d\u201cChocolate is healthy! No, chocolate in unhealthy!\u201dIt allows students to put science into context while at the same time distinguishing it from pseudoscience, which is something very few people are capable of, apparently.
