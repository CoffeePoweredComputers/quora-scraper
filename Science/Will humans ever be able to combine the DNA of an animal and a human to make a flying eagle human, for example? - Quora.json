            "answer_text": "I will make this short, as these are purely speculations. DNA to me is a language with different dialects. Homo Sapiens Sapiens mostly understand one another and therefore you can interchange DNA with two individual humans. Another animal uses a different dialect, and therefore these do not compute and cannot work together. If in some way one was to convert the codes to interact with the other part, then in theory it could accept the addition. To put it into perspective, there are different languages of computing, and sometimes you can convert a file to another, which means that the original file - while it may have lost some function - has been converted, and can now interact with this new file\u2019s language. Even within its own species it is not always simple to communicate. With organ or tissue transplantation sometimes the body rejects it, and we can\u2019t simply reconnect a new arm to a limbless individual. There is a long way to go with stem cells, which potentially can rebuild an arm as you see it on a lizardtail, before we can start worrying about interspecie operations and whichever ethics we may face. In early stages of development, it is impossible to distinct different species of animals, as we all still have the same initial steps before differentiating, which is due to evolution. Many may not know this, but humans also \u2018hatch\u2019. If there is some way to start this project; I believe the key is development and finding a way to include cells between species and understand how the cells communicate. I believe it was rumored Russia researched half man half gorilla possibilities. You can look that up. Obviously it didn\u2019t happen, and a lot has happened since the Cold War. We must be reasonable - in order to have a human fly, I believe it has been tested numerous times - because the human muscles that work on the shoulder are not designed to be as powerful as a bird\u2019s, as well as the lower extremity and body has so high density compared to a bird, you would need wings with a total length of about 3 times your height as well as pecs and lats that are much more powerful. You wouldn\u2019t be able to enter an elevator, but then again, you wouldn\u2019t need to. A man can dream. ",

            "answer_text": "There's two parts to this question 1) Can we? 2) Will we? I'm sure you'll get a lot of answers for \"will we\". I'll do the \"can we\". I think the first part is easy to answer. Yes we will have the ability to modify are own genetics. The very next question that comes to mind is. \"Are we talking in situ?\" This means changing \"in place\" and in terms of this question it means \"Can I change myself?\" The answer to that, as well, is yes. There are two methods, the first has already been tried and was a initially a huge failure: a virus vector. The second, nanotechnology, should be able to handle it much easier.  I'll examine both. Virus Vector A virus, which is not life as it performs no metabolism or self replication, is simply a group of proteins. It can enter living cells because it has a receptor on the envelope surface that the cell accepts and moves through the cell membrane.  Once in side the cell unbundles those proteins and the cell's own mechanisms replicate the DNA of the virus to make more copies of those proteins, which in turn bind back together due to the laws of physical chemistry (there are RNA virus that first have to make DNA but let's stick with double-stranded DNA viruses for now). A lot of viruses simply get into the nuclear envelope of the host cell which begins making the viral proteins because the DNA is now in the nucleus. However, some viruses have proteins that allow molecular chemistry to insert the viral DNA into the host's DNA. Now each time the host copies its own DNA the viral DNA gets copied as well and if it has open frames (genes) it may even participate in protein synthesis. Of course, it gets copied every time a cell replicates, making it a permanent part of the host's DNA. This is known as a endogenous retroviruses (ERV) or provirus. (I have always found this fascinating and even back in my undergraduate days I was wondering, \"So how much of human DNA is actually from ERV?\" Current studies say about 4-8% but most of it has no open frames and so is considering non-coding.) Virus transmit genetics horizontally through organisms, this is on aspect of evolution many forget. Overtime as the host cells die the replacement cells would have the genetic modification eventually making all cells in the organism contain the viral genetic material. Now suppose we created a cure for a genetic disease in vitro but need some way to get it in situ. Well, we could certainly use a ERV as a vector. Build a custom payload that contained the correct proteins to cut the DNA at the correct point and fix the DNA sequence creating the error. We do this all the time in vitro, it is known as gene splicing in biotech but used in situ in humans to cure genetic diseases or even make changes, it is known as gene therapy. In cases like sickle cell anemia, a single base pair (HBB on chromosome 11) this could be very easy to solve as the biotech is pretty simple: we just need a vector. If a person were to be \"infected\" with a human made virus repeatedly enough bone marrow cells could be changed to reduce the amount of sickle cells to a point it would no longer matter. And as those repaired cells replicated, over time the disease would just disappear in the patient. Viruses mainly infect somatic cells, not gametes, but if enough cells responsible for gamete production (oogensis or spermatogenesis) it might even mean a patient's children might be born without the disease. Maybe even if we can't modify our own DNA currently, we can create a virus that produces the proper proteins to cure some disease. Using an adenovirus vector we can insert a DNA payload into the nucleus and it will starting producing the proper proteins even as the native nuclear DNA produces the improper ones.  For a mutation that stops a given protein from being synthesized or a one where all that is needed is a given amount of the proper protein, this can affect a change. Here's a paper on adenovirus  gene therapy (Gene Therapy Using Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors).  Now this isn't permanent because when the cell replicates it doesn't replicate the viral DNA in the nuclear envelope so many treatments over a patien'ts life is required and for diseases like sickle cell where red blood cells live a very short time, this would be short lived at best. We have been very successful with some cases using adenovirus as a vector for gene therapy. One even in the brain (as viruses are too large to passes the BBB). I think we are on the verge of this becoming standard practice and in the EU, there is already one approved adenovirus gene therapy product. None of these are permanent because they don't carry on in cell replication, and the patient will need many treatments over their lifetime. This treatments will be expensive and it is not surprising the drug companies are putting their money in adenovirus vectors instead of ERVs. With ERVs their would be one or two treatments perhaps that lead to a cure and a loss of revenue stream from the manufacturer, where as with adenovirus vectors the patients has to keep coming ... and paying. This is certainly more attractive to medicine-for-money as opposed to medicine-for-humanity. NanotechnologyOf course, though it sounds more sci-fi than reality right now, nano-robots could accomplish the same thing. We could build nanobots that repair DNA in all cells (or just the target ones) and cure just about every genetic disease. To me nano-tech is similar to molecular chemistry because at that level we aren't \"building\" things like we think of construction, but assembly things using molecules, and in my thinking this is more in the realm of biology than engineering. If we build a custom DNA package (which we can do) put it in a custom designed virus vector (right now we are using a naturally found virus vector) then we have actually achieved the first simple nanobot. Whether we can get biotech engineering down to the point that where we can produce tiny computers is unimportant because I don't think we can think of nanobots as computers, but simply custom chemical agents (organic chemistry in terms of biology). I did once read a paper on someone that proposed we could create a custom cell nucleus. This would be a nanobot that would handle all the normal processes a cell nucleus does but be built with custom DNA and since it would be built from biology it could replicate itself as part of cell replication. If the nucleus of the first cell of an organism was removed and replaced with this man-made nucleus then that organism would now have every cell containing the man made nucleus. Even that organisms off spring would contain the man-made nucleus. Using such a system, we would be in absolute control of our own biology.  Can We?Yes, we can in fact already do some rudimentary gene therapy. I do think we will master ERVs and eventually be able to modify our own DNA in situ. This would mean we could insert many of the genes we find in the natural world like GFP, dsRed, YFP, etc. You could have tattoos that produce light.

And if we can do these techniques to cure disease we can certainly do them to make other changes. Can humans fly? I think so many changes would need to be made to bone structure, tissues, etc that it wouldn't be human (someone will answer that). Can we use them to increase muscle and bone mass for athletes?  Certainly.  Creative Common license - Wikipedia Belgian Blue \"double muscled\" bovine. Note: This was typed three days ago and I forgot to submit. Sorry. ",
