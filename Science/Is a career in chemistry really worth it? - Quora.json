            "answer_text": "There is no simple answer for that question: what does \u201creally worth it\u201d mean? If you wish to work and study at a well-known university, and succeed in doing so, then you might wish to treat that as an intellectual end unto itself. But if you expect that will open the door to a career in Chemistry, then the job market for well-qualified chemists is already very saturated with\u2026..well-qualified chemists. You might also consider a third pathway, in which a chemistry degree helps, but is not the end-all (e.g., patent lawyers, environmental engineer, etc. To a significant extent, \u201cbeing a chemist\u201d means having a graduate degree in the field. At the same time, research-lead universities depend on inexpensive graduate students to carry out the laboratory projects of research directors, be teaching assistants for large-enrollment classes and ultimately bring in grant overheads for the universities. They aren\u2019t there to prepare you for the job market, because otherwise they would demonstrate this by providing data on long-term employment outcomes for their graduates. Be warned. Get objective advice. ",
