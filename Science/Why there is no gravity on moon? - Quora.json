            "answer_text": "There is gravity on the moon, its just way weaker than earths gravity because the moon has less mass. Nothing has zero gravity. Anything thats made of something has its own little pull, so when something as big as the moon or the earth comes together, it pulls everything towards the middle. The moon even pulls the earth a little bit! On the videos of the moonwalks, the two guys walking (hopping) around (in their 300+ lbs space suit) dont just float away. Even if you had a trampoline on the moon and jumped as high as you could, you wouldnt float away. Youd be in the moons sky for at least a few minutes, but youd fall back down again, really softly. The scary part would be when you're waaaay up off the ground and FEEL like youll just keep floating away, but that wont happen unless you have a really fast rocket and fly straight up (Hopefully towards the earth). I hope this helped! Just remember that everything (even air) pulls everything else, and space is only the only thing that doesnt, because space is only emptiness. ",

            "answer_text": "Who told you there is no gravity on moon? It is there. Each and every object in the universe has gravity. You, me, moons, planets, stars, in short every object do have gravity. Basically, bodies having mass have gravity. I said you have gravity, right? How do you have gravity? Because you have mass, you are attracting each and everything around you. The tables, chairs, your parents, everything. But this force is so much less that they don\u2019t come and stick to you. But out there, in the sky these planets, natural satellites and those stars are so massive, (as you know it) that there force of gravity is so immense that they set other objects in motion around them. And do you know why all those celestial objects are round? They are round because of gravity. They are massive enough to have enough gravity to make them round. Those asteroids are not round. Why? Because they don\u2019t have enough gravity to get a round shape. Get this cleared to you that objects have gravity, this is a force possessed by everything that has mass. I hope you get it! :-) ",
