            "answer_text": "Suppose you are holding a pencil and you start to vibrate it. It is important to note that regardless of whether or not the object is noticeably vibrating, the atoms or molecules that make up the object is in constant vibration on a minute scale. Their vibrational energy is proportional to their reduced mass and the force constant of the bonds of the said atom. When you physically vibrate the object, the atoms will respond to this by adjusting their vibrational motion in an appropriate way which depends on, again, their reduced mass and their force constant. You may look up Hooke\u2019s Law if you are interested. To add on, the number of vibrational modes a molecule has is always constant. This means that by vibrating the object, you cannot change the way the molecule or atoms vibrate. You can only change the vibrational energy. Hope that answered your question. Cheers. ",

            "answer_text": "Atoms and molecules vibrate with a frequency about 10^13 Hz. An object can vibrate at a frequency, let's say, about 100 000Hz = 10^5 Hz (ultrasound, that is already a lot).So nothing is happening to the atoms due to the vibration of the object. ",
