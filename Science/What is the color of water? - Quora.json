            "answer_text": "Nothing \u201cis\u201d any particular colour. Colour is a feature of perception. We see things when light bouncing off them reaches our eyes and our brain interprets this information. The system didn\u2019t evolve to capture and process every detail of every aspect of what we see; that would be pointless. Its purpose is to register what\u2019s helpful in enabling us to maintain a mental model of our immediate environment that\u2019s beneficial in avoiding danger, finding food, and so on. Even in this, it\u2019s imperfect. Opponent processes are fundamental to colour perception. Another way to put that is that it\u2019s all about contrast. Lots of optical illusions show how the same surface can look completely different to us depending on context. Surrounded by darker areas, it looks brighter. Surrounded by redder areas, it looks bluer. The brain isn\u2019t trying to establish an objective colour value for each point, like the RGB specs we use in tech. (Even RGB specs aren\u2019t objective, which is why we have colour management systems, and that\u2019s a bigger world of pain than we can get into here.) It\u2019s just trying to detect what\u2019s useful to distinguish within the scene right now. When a surface absorbs some wavelengths of light but not others, we see colour, according to what\u2019s reflected back. Water generally allows light to pass through it, so any colours we see depend on what\u2019s absorbed by whatever\u2019s the other side of it, but its surface can also be highly reflective, especially when still, so we also see the colours of things around it. You could say water doesn\u2019t have a colour. All that means is that it has roughly the same effect on all wavelengths of light. (You could say the same of a matt black card.) To give it a colour you\u2019d need to unbalance its reflectance. You could do this by adding some dye \u2013 molecules that absorb some wavelengths of light, letting only selected frequencies reflect back to your eye. But it would still look different depending on the ambient light, neighbouring surfaces, and all the factors in your visual processing, such as whether you\u2019d previously been staring at a bright light or a different-coloured surface, or had a form of colour blindness, and so on. There\u2019s no right answer to \u201cWhat colour is it really?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "That's actually a tricky question It seems at first sight that water is colourless. Why though ? Let's talk about how we see colour. A long time ago all life was in the ocean. When vision appeared, it was designed by evolution to see through water. Therefore, the light sensitive cells were designed to reach with wavelengths that could pass through water  You see ? Visible light (the rainbow stripe) is composed of the less absorbed wavelength. Therefore visible light can go through water. What is colour then ? You can define the colour of a fluid by the wavelength that are not absorbed by it. That's why water seems colorless because it doesn't appear to absorb colour But does it ? Let's look closer at the absorption diagram of the water :  You see that red is more absorbed by water than blue. It isn't visible for the water in your glass, but for meters of water, it is. Therefore water is slightly blue and that color becomes stronger as the amount of water increases. What colour is water ? Colorless for us, because of how our vision evolved, and blue for physicists, because of how it does absorbe light. ",
