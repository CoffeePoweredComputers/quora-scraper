            "answer_text": "The property is called free energy. A reaction occurs when the free energy of the components can decrease.  A reaction is a rearrangement of atoms and electrons that minimises the free energy of that system. This is not just \"energy\" and it is not free, it is a calculated quantity that involves energy and entropy. More formally you can call it Gibbs Free Energy; Engineers often use the partial molar quantity which they call the \"chemical potential\", which is an excellent name to capture the spirit. If  you prepare pure elements of matter, such as you find in the periodic  table, they are unreactive in themselves, but this apparent stability is  only relative.  There is no rearrangement possibility. But they are  highly reactive in combination, ie between elements, because of both possibility increases and energy releases.  You may not be aware, that it is possible to arrange things so that the actual energy stored in a system increases, so then it can even suck heat out of the system and spontaneously freeze. So when you hear people say or write, that change always goes in the direction of increased disorder, they are wrong. The frozen state is plainly more ordered. It is also colder, and has lost heat energy without putting it in the fridge. Dissolving ammonium nitrate in water does exactly this. You can google it....    A reaction that absorbs heat is called \"endothermic\" and if heat is generated that is called \"exothermic\". There are two independant drivers that can work together or compete - they are Energy and Entropy.  They can be written in a single equation of state, here is one chemists use a lot: G = H - TS There are two terms in this equation, the first is an internal energy measure called enthalpy (H ), the second is an entropy contribution. The  H in this equation is actually E + PV where E is the internal energy  that most people associate with chemical energy. It is the bonding  forces that have been applied within the substance. The PV term  (pressure volume work)  is a lot smaller in magnitude so we can ignore  these for our purposes.  The TS term is significant.  T means Temperature. S means Entropy. (I have no idea why these letters are so unhelpful, without googling the history.) It also means that the entropy term becomes dominant at high enough temperatures. To a chemist entropy is not merely some vague abstract physical thing to do with heat engines, it is a very real and calculable property. There are tables giving the entropy of chemical substances that you can look up and read the actual values. It is a distinct chemical property of real substances. Page on indiana.edu A reaction is a rearrangement of atoms and electrons that minimises the free energy of that system. An explosion is a case where both factors work together. Energy is released from the reactants and the reactants increase in entropy. Surprisingly though the explosion is NOT caused by the energy release primarily! Most explosives contain nitrogen and by rearrangement that can form nitrogen gas which is a simple N~N molecule in large numbers. The many forms of motion available to the gas state and the many formed motion units are greatly favoured because they represent more ways that energy can be distributed within the set of atoms. This is the concept of thermodynamic entropy, not the amount of energy, but a count of the equivalent available states for distributing the energy. In a way it is as if energy not only prefers to be let out of jail, it also likes to be highly sociable. Never underestimate the sociability of energy, this is the basic idea of thermodynamic entropy, and it is energy and entropy that cause change.At times entropy or \"sociability of the energy\" can dominate even to the extent that the system could spontaneously freeze! as above. The Ammonium nitrate has a lot of \"highly structured water\" in the crystals, with low entropy. When it becomes less structured it provides more opportunities for heat energy to be redistributed within the less structured form of water, and the average energy per water molecule has dropped. You have to be a bit careful here too, because space itself is a system for introducing possibilities, so that if you physically allow a gas say, access to more space it will occupy the space. This volume change is an entropy effect, and so it is a Free Energy effect, and you wont be able to put the Genie back into his bottle. This is what drives the expansion of gases, but if you think about it, this same effect can also help to drive the creation of gases. A system will settle into its new Free Energy state and stay there forever until we open the system to become part of a larger system.   The widening of a definition can be physical, such as introducing  something across a boundary, or conceptual, simply considering a larger  scale. The most unreactive things around us like water have already minimised free energy.  Sometime favourable changes don't happen for certain reasons. Normally fitrewood for example does not \"spontaneously combust\". So far we have been talking energetics. There is a branch of chemical study called kinetics.  It also turns out that many large rearrangements are often prevented by a small barrier. This \"activation energy\" is like taking a bank loan for the deposit on a house, a small deficit must be invested before a large gain becomes possible. Striking a match generates heat that allows the match head to melt, the atoms to move and thus the fire spreads. A chemical catalyst is also an enabler by bringing together two parties (molecules) and lowering the activation energy for a particular rearrangement to occur.   We could also inject some entropy advantage to initiate a reaction. Mixing, grinding, dissolving are all techniques to improve the rate of a reaction, and may also affect the free energy because these techniques have measurable free energies themselves. The same principles apply to chemical as to physical changes. ",

            "answer_text": "An apparently simple question with a more complex than expected answer!  Good question! A chemical reaction is, basically, a reorganization of electrons.  That is, the bonds, which are electrons, between two elements or molecules or ions, rearrange to a lower energy configuration.  There are two parts to this: there must be a more favorable energy state available to the reactants, and there must be a way for them to get there. So say for example that you have a molecule of hydrogen (H2) and a molecule of chlorine (Cl2).  Now if you were to combine a liter of hydrogen gas and a liter of chlorine gas, nothing would happen.  The problem is that while there is a much lower energy state available to the atoms (HCl), they are already in a stable state and need a push to start the process.  That push is energy supplied to the mixture that is sufficient to break either a hydrogen-hydrogen bond or a chlorine-chlorine bond.   The energy can come from heat such as a spark or a lit match, or it can come from high energy light.  (I have actually seen this reaction started by using the light from a lit piece of magnesium!).   Once that first bond is broken, you have two chlorine atoms, both of them looking for something to bond to.  The electrons of those chlorine atoms are free to seek out bonds with the hydrogen atoms.  When they find hydrogen atoms well glory be!  Not only can they form a bond, but the bond is much more stable and the formation of that bond generates more energy.   The energy from the formation of those first few chlorine-hydrogen bonds goes on to break other hydrogen-hydrogen and chlorine-chlorine bonds, and those freed atoms can then go on and find other atoms of the opposite variety, generating more energy, and that energy can go on to initiate more bond scissions, and so on until everything that can react has reacted.   The above is a very simple example, but it illustrates the two main components of a chemical reaction:  there must be a lower energy configuration available to the atoms or molecules. This is called the Thermodynamics of the reaction,  There must also be a mechanism by which the atoms of molecules can re-arrange to that lower energy configuration.  This is called the Kinetics of the reaction. And that, in a nutshell, is why a chemical reaction happens. ",
