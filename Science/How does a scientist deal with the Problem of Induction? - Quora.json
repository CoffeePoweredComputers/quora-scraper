            "answer_text": "How does a scientist deal with the Problem of Induction? There is no Problem of Induction. Induction was a fantasy in the philosophy of science before Hume, who was the first to explain clearly why it could not possibly work. (Mathematical induction is very different, and works just fine because it is a method of proof, not of generalizing from examples.) Science does not try to generalize from observation by piling up instances, like counting black crows or white swans in order to make a generalization. It proceeds by building mathematical models intended to match available observations, and give a mechanism for the phenomenon being studied. Then scientists attempt to test those models to destruction by finding the very specific circumstances that could falsify them. Genetics, and then molecular biology, explain black crows and white swans adequately, but make it clear that other colors are possible, as indeed we see in profusion on other birds. Copernicus improved on the Ptolemaic model of stars and planets going around the Earth, with complex motions compounded of circular epicycles. Instead he had planets going around the Sun with complex motions compounded of circular epicycles. But his model explained why the inner planets stay near the Sun, and why the outer planets are brightest at opposition, and why they give the appearance of retrograde motion, and above all his model, with somewhat improved epicycles, gave more accurate calculations for the date of Easter, and more accurate tables for navigation. The Catholic Church loved it at first, and only Martin Luther complained that it contradicted the Bible. The Catholic Church turned against the Copernican model, and against Galileo, not because of any actual objection to the science, but because the Pope erroneously thought that Galileo had insulted him in a book. Kepler improved on the Copernican model by showing that the motion of Mars is best fitted by an ellipse. The calculation, based on Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations, was sufficient, without requiring further observations. Newton improved on the Keplerian model by showing that inverse-square gravitation would generate elliptical orbits for both planets and comets orbiting the Sun, and for the moons of Jupiter. His model was immediately successful in explaining tides as well, with induction nowhere in sight. Einstein improved on Newton by creating a tensor model in which there is no absolute space and time, and the orbit of Mercury is better fitted by a geodesic in spacetime than by a Newtonian ellipse (modified, in both cases, by the effects of other planets). The scientific world did not then test Einstein\u2019s theory by collecting multitudes of examples of Einsteinian gravity. Eddington\u2019s single observation of light bending around the sun in an eclipse showed twice as much bending as Newtonian gravity predicts, which is exactly what Einsteinian gravity predicts. That was enough to prove Einstein right. We continue to look for holes in Einsteinian gravity, and not to count its continuous use in the GPS as inductive evidence for it. We know that predictions of singularities inside black holes and at the Big Bang are spurious, and look forward to some kind of workable quantum gravity to tell us, in some degree, what is really going on. To reiterate: There is no proof in science, and certainly no such thing as inductive proof. The best that most physicists can hope for is to misunderstand at a deeper level. Wolfgang Pauli ",

            "answer_text": "Who told you that we have a problem with it? I am assuming you mean in reasoning. A few things happened that make us resistant to its effects. We are all taught mathematics, which includes how to prove things mathematically, and that includes proof by induction. You can actually prove some things by induction, and in those cases it is not a stumbling block but it is how to get there. Since it is a proof, well, qed.In addition to proof by induction, the vast majority of scientists are taught other things as well. I know that to the religious or to some purists this seems like blasphemy. But we are. I swear. All the way from shoe tying to barely comprehensible cosmology. A few can fix cars. So we tend to know things and to not be all that full of shit. I invite you to try us.A few of us have been caught up and have used faulty reasoning and wishful thinking. The State of Florida, where I\u2019m from, had a very bad reputation due to something that I think FSU did in that respect. Nothing\u2019s perfect. Shit happens. I stlil say try us.We don\u2019t have a problem with induction. We are smart. Even smarter than your average dog. I again invite you to try us. The vast majority of us knows that we can wake up on a bad day and do stupid things. Most of us will admit doing that reasonably often. But all that learning gives us ways to internally check. We do. We catch flaws at a very high rate. And if we don\u2019t? Our peers will catch them for us and fuck severely with us. That\u2019s another way to say that all manner of mistake making, including believing a thing because of induction, are handled by peer review. You don\u2019t think that we imposed that curse on ourselves just because we can\u2019t find BDSM partners, do you? So, do we need an anti-induction specialist to help us along? Someone from, maybe, philosophy? Just sit down at your table in your kitchen, all made of modern materials that started as science, and that do their jobs, warm up your coffee that was shipped in on tankers that could never have been that efficient without science in your microwave oven (need i say more), pick up your cell phone that is science personified, call anyone you want anywhere who\u2019s in science, and chat about it. We are doing fine, thanks. Induction has not eaten us yet. ",
