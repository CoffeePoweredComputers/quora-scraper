            "answer_text": "-The question was \u201cplanet\u201d not universe when this was written. This is going to be difficult to summarize but ill give it a go. Billions of years ago a star much bigger (more massive to be exact) than our current star exploded in a (type I) supernova. This supernova came from a star that was once made of almost 100% hydrogen, the pressure of the huge star fused the hydrogen into helium giving off heat and light as a byproduct, when the hydrogen became less abundant the star started fusing the helium together and so forth and so on\u2026 until iron, stars die when they make iron (bear in mind only things lighter than iron have been created and iron is pretty light on the atomic scale so, not much to work with here numerically). The star cannot fuse the iron together (more than once) and a supernova occurs, the core collapses in a violent act that both creates all the heavier elements in a fraction of a second and releases a monstrous amount of energy in the same time throwing the body of a star outward in a gigantic cloud of all the leftover hydrogen, helium and more importantly all those \u201cheavier than iron elements\u201d copper, gold, nickle, uranium... all of it thrown out into space in a elemental soup we call a nebula. the elements started to attract one another with gravity until a cluster of atoms crashes into another cluster of atoms making a yet larger cluster which in turn had more mass to attract other smaller clusters until you have most of the \u201cstuff\u201d that was thrown out by the original supernova has coalesced making 1 (much smaller) star, at least 8 planets and countless smaller pieces (asteroids, dwarf planets, moons) that fell into an orbit around the sun or other planets before they could join one of the other masses like Earth or the Sun. Make no mistake, everything in the solar system is still trying to fall together just like it always has, the sun is trying to pull earth into it to add our mass to its own and the earth is gently pulling the sun back but we are moving away from the sun sideways at the same rate that we are falling towards it in an orbit.
