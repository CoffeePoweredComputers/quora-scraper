            "answer_text": "Monoammonium phosphate, also known as tri-class, multipurpose, or ABC dry chemical, used on class A, B and C fires. It receives its class A rating from the agent's ability to melt and flow at 177 \u00b0C (351 \u00b0F) to smother the fire. More corrosive than other dry chemical agents. Pale yellow in color. Sodium bicarbonate, regular or ordinary used on class B and C fires, was the first of the dry chemical agents developed. In the heat of a fire, it releases a cloud of carbon dioxide that smothers the fire. That is, the gas drives oxygen away from the fire, thus stopping the chemical reaction. This agent is not generally effective on class A fires because the agent is expended and the cloud of gas dissipates quickly, and if the fuel is still sufficiently hot, the fire starts up again. Potassium bicarbonate (principal constituent of Purple-K), used on class B and C fires. About two times as effective on class B fires as sodium bicarbonate, it is the preferred dry chemical agent of the oil and gas industry. The only dry chemical agent certified for use in ARFF by the NFPA. Colored violet to distinguish it. Potassium bicarbonate & Urea Complex (AKA Monnex), used on class B and C fires. More effective than all other powders due to its ability to decrepitate (where the powder breaks up into smaller particles) in the flame zone creating a larger surface area for free radical inhibition. Grey in color. Potassium chloride, or Super-K, dry chemical was developed in an effort to create a high efficiency, protein-foam compatible dry chemical. Developed in the 60s, prior to Purple-K, it was never as popular as other agents since, being a salt, it was quite corrosive. For B and C fires, white in color. Foam-compatible, which is a sodium bicarbonate (BC) based dry chemical, was developed for use with protein foams for fighting class B fires. Most dry chemicals contain metal stearates to waterproof them, but these will tend to destroy the foam blanket created by protein (animal) based foams. Foam compatible type uses silicone as a waterproofing agent, which does not harm foam. Effectiveness is identical to regular dry chemical, and it is light green in color (some ANSUL brand formulations are blue). This agent is generally no longer used since most modern dry chemicals are considered compatible with synthetic foams such as AFFF.   ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure many chemicals do, but the usual one that springs to mind is ammonium phosphate. It melts around 400 degrees F, which is lower than the burning temperature of most household goods like paper, wood and plastics, taking its latent heat of melting out of the fire and smothering it. On oil fires it forms a layer on the surface and again, cuts off the air to extinguish it. A lot of people are under the impression that after you use a dry powder extinguisher on a fire, you just sweep or vacuum up the powder after and life goes on. Not so! It ruins everything it touches. A less messy extinguisher is carbon dioxide gas, which displaces oxygen and smothers the fire, but it doesn\u2019t have a strong cooling effect, so after it disperses the fire can start up again. ",
