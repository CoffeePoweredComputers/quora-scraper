            "answer_text": "Polarity of a molecule is determined by the atoms in the molecule and their relative electronegativities. Where does electronegativity come from? The atoms size. Large atoms have their valence shell electrons (outer shell e- that reacts with others) FURTHER away from the positive charge nucleus making it harder to pull electrons to it. Small atoms have their valence shell CLOSER to the nucleus making it easier to pull electrons toward it. This is according to Coulomb\u2019s law where r^2 (distance) is strongest factor   Which is why F (top right on periodic table) the smallest atom is the most electronegative and Fr (bottom left) is the largest and least electronegative. If one atom is more electronegative than the atom it\u2019s bonded to, or sharing electrons with, the more electronegative atom will \u201cpull\u201d electrons harder towards it. This creates separation of charge over a distance. The more electronegative atom will have higher electron density (d- or partial negative), and the less electronegative atom will have lower electron density (d+ or partial positive). Look at the periodic table and use your understanding of electronegativity to see if my following statements are correct:  O-C is a more polar bond than N-C (O is more electronegative than N) F-C is a more polar bond than Cl-C (F is more electronegative than Cl) Now back to molecules.  H and O share 2 electrons in O-H bond, but because O has a higher electronegativity than H, O pulls the 2 electrons closer to itself and away from H. This creates a VECTOR where partial positive charge is with H and partial negative charge is with O. Vectors are important to understand polarity, because vectors can cancel each other out (if magnitude is the same and in the opposite direction). Which is why some molecules can be Non-Polar even though made of atoms with polar bonds. This is why we need to understand the Geometry of molecules.  H-F is clearly polar. One vector towards the more electronegative atom. CO2 molecule however is NOT polar. Because the linear geometry and vector arrows going in the opposite direction. O is pulling electron density of C to the left while the other O is pulling electron density of C to the right. These vectors are the same magnitude in the opposite direction, so they cancel each other out like an equal tug of war. SO2 molecule IS polar because of its Geometry. The left and right pull of vectors cancel out, but since both vectors point down in the same direction, they add together in the downward direction. So the molecule SO2 has a NET polarity or dipole vector from central S directly down.  Hope this concept is now obvious to you. If not: the key to polarity is electronegativity, polarity is a vector meaning direction matters and can make a molecule non polar if polar vectors cancel out. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost all large molecules are polar. In small molecules, the polarity of bonds can \u201caccidentally\u201d cancel each other out. For larger molecules with many rotatable bonds and a lot of conformational flexibility, this is rarely the case. Only when all the bonds are relatively apolar, the molecule will be apolar. But for larger molecules, especially biologically active molecules, the situation is normally more complex: they often have polar and apolar regions in very precisely orchestrated ways. You can therefore not usefully describe their behavior with a single polarity number. ",
