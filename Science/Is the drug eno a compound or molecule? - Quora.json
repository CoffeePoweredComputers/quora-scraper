            "answer_text": "Firstly I should tell you that the question you asked is not right. Lets discuss the meaning of the terms \u201ccompounds\u201d and \u201cmolecules\u201d. Compound The word compound is usually used in contrast to element. A compound is formed by the combination of different elements. For example in NaCl(Common salt), Na and Cl are elements while NaCl as a whole is a compound. Molecules The term molecule is generally used in contrast to the word atom. Atom is the smallest entity of an element which cannot be further divided while a molecule is the smallest entity of a compound. For example HCl as a whole is a molecule while H and Cl are individual atoms. As per your question eno is a compound and also consists of molecules ",

It is an antacid and it\u2019s ingredients are typically what one would expect from an antacid: sodium bicarbonate (), sodium carbonate () and citric acid. If you recall your chemistry 101, the carbonates and bicarbonates on reacting with acids gives  and water. Citric acid dissolves in water to form a mild acid and along with the other acids present in your stomach, react with the other components to release carbon dioxide and water. Basically, you\u2019d be burping  for some time! Happy burping. ",
