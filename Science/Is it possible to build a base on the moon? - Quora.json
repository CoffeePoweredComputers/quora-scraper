Surface colonies  Variant for habitat creation on the surface or over lava tube  A NASA model of a proposed inflatable module A possibly easier solution would be to build the lunar base on the surface, and cover the modules with lunar soil. The lunar soil is composed of a unique blend of silica and iron-containing compounds that may be fused into a glass-like solid using microwave energy. [89] Blacic has studied the mechanical properties of lunar glass and has shown that it is a promising material for making rigid structures, if coated with metal to keep moisture out. [90] This may allow for the use of \"lunar bricks\" in structural designs, or the vitrification of loose dirt to form a hard, ceramic crust. A lunar base built on the surface would need to be protected by improved radiation and micrometeoroid shielding. Building the lunar base inside a deep crater would provide at least partial shielding against radiation and micrometeoroids. Artificial magnetic fields have been proposed [91] [92] as a means to provide radiation shielding for long range deep space crewed missions, and it might be possible to use similar technology on a lunar colony. Some regions on the Moon possess strong local magnetic fields that might partially mitigate exposure to charged solar and galactic particles. [93] In a turn from the usual engineer-designed lunar habitats, London-based Foster + Partnersarchitectural firm proposed a building construction 3D-printer technology in January 2013 that would use lunar regolith raw materials to produce lunar building structures while using enclosed inflatable habitats for housing the human occupants inside the hard-shell lunar structures. Overall, these habitats would require only ten percent of the structure mass to be transported from Earth, while using local lunar materials for the other 90 percent of the structure mass. [94] \"Printed\" lunar soil would provide both \"radiation and temperature insulation. Inside, a lightweight pressurized inflatable with the same dome shape would be the living environment for the first human Moon settlers.\" [94] The building technology would include mixing lunar material with magnesium oxide, which would turn the \"moonstuff into a pulp that can be sprayed to form the block\" when a binding salt is applied that \"converts [this] material into a stone-like solid.\" [94] Terrestrial versions of this 3D-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) of building material per hour with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres (11 ft) per hour, sufficient to complete a building in a week.

            "answer_text": "Technically, yes. It would be possible, but the more important aspect is to question whether it is practical. You also need to ask what you mean by a moonbase. At its most basic, you could be looking at a basic shelter (preferably constructed partially below the surface) where astronauts could stay for an extended period. Or you could be looking at something akin to an Antarctic research base - permanently manned by a small group of scientists. Or, moving firmly into Scifi territory, it could be a full scale facility, receiving, servicing and despatching manned and unmanned spacecraft. The trouble is.. Even though it is certainly possible to establish something on the lower end of the scale, the sheer cost would be eye-watering. The Apollo program cost 25 billion dollars fifty years ago, over 150 billion today allowing for inflation. So a scheme to set up even a basic facility, and then to service, supply and staff it would be astronomical (forgive the pun) Since we are already getting valuable science from the manned missions in the sixties and early seventies, plus the subsequent unmanned probes, can the massive further expense be justified? In the short term, I doubt it. ",
