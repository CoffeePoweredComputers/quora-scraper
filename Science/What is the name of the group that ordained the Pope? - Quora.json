The pope must be a bishop and member of the college of cardinals (all cardinals must now be bishops). Being a cardinal is a (mostly) honorary position that is granted by the pope. Bishops are ordained by other bishops with the pope\u2019s approval. Fr. Jorge Bergoglio was ordained a priest in 1969 by Bishop Ramon Jose Castellano (Archbishop of Cordoba, Argentina). Fr. Bergoglio was then ordained a bishop in 1992 by Cardinal Antonio Quarracino (Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Argentina). Bishop Bergoglio was elected pope in 2013 by the College of Cardinals. ",

            "answer_text": "Jorge Bergoglio was ordained a priest by Ram\u00f3n Jos\u00e9 Castellano, who was Archbishop of Cordoba at the time. He was consecrated a bishop by Antonio Quarracino, who was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, an office that Bergoglio would later occupy himself. That\u2019s the answer to the question of who \u201cordained\u201d him. But becoming Pope is not an ordination. When Archbishop Bergoglio became Pope Francis, he had already been ordained to the presbyterate and episcopate, which are the only requirements of the office. Being selected as the next Pope simply meant that he was now the Bishop of Rome and the titular head of the entire Catholic Church. That decision rested with the College of Cardinals, of which he was a member (Pope John Paul II made him a cardinal). ",

            "answer_text": "The pope would have first been ordained a deacon by God through whoever was the Bishop of his diocese at that time. Then approximately a year later (1969) he would have been ordained a Priest by God again through the Bishop of his diocese (Archbishop Cordoba). Then he was consecrated as a Bishop by Cardinal Quarrino in 1992. He was then elevated to Cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2001. He was then elected by the Pontifical College of Cardinals in 2012. Popes are not ordained: they are elected. Their ordination was as deacon then priest and then bishop. So his original ordination as with all clergy in the Catholic Church came as a Deacon. ",
