What is the best way to empty a average size swimming pool that is full of algae and other stuff from remaining stagnant for a long time? It is usually illegal to just drain highly chlorinated water into a sewer or curb drain. The company I work for has to drain pools occasionally to perform the plumbing repair work. We cover portions of Los Angeles County. Some, but not all, cities we work in require that the water is dechlorinated prior to entering the sewer or curb drain system. The City inspectors will actually drive around their areas and cite those without permits. Your profile says you live in Menifee. Here are the contacts to call regarding pool drainage in Menifee. I would start with he top name. If he is not the one you need to speak with, he will tell you which inspector to speak with. | Menifee, CA - Official Website  ",

It is relatively easy to throw a sump pump into the pool drain it take a brush and scrub it and rinse it with chlorine and then rinse it with water and then refill the pool. Having said that, I strongly caution you against draining your own pool leave that to a pool professional, someone who has experience and the proper Insurance to guard against what we refer to as pool popping, you really don't want your pool to be sitting empty for long periods of time particularly if there's a lot of groundwater nearby.
