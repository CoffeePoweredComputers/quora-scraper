But if we consider a reaction in which the proton is initially motionless and so with zero momentum, and we consider  of the two particles: positron and pion, then the mass of this system is exactly the same of that of the proton. Infact. Energy E is conserved, so the sum of the energies of positron and pion (which comprise their kinetic energies and their rest mass) is equal to the proton's rest energy E; momentum is conserved, so it must be zero also for the system of  and , we apply to this system the equation:  and we find    ",

            "answer_text": "As the other responders have written, proton decay is not (currently) known to occur. None the less, many models (e.g. SU(5), one of the first gradient unified theories (GUTs)) predict its existence. Electric charge, momentum and energy are conserved (this can be proven by the symmetry of the laws of nature; mass is not conserved (i.e. the is no law of nature that requires it. p.s. there are a few more isoteric quantum numbers that are conserved as well). A well-known example of mass non-conserving decay is beta (radioactive) decay ( ",
