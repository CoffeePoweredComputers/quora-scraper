            "answer_text": "We know exactly why economies are good or bad. There is a list of countries based on their economic freedom, and in general the higher the economic freedom the better the economy does. I watched this live as China implemented many capitalist reforms in their country, and just doing that has boosted their economy in amazing ways. In recent years the list moved the USA up the list, and during this time the economy boomed. Venezuela did the opposite, and you can see the disastrous effects. Again I watched this happen. Few people know that the US economy was coming back after the start of the Great Depression. But in an effort to \u201csave\u201d the economy the government pushed us into that historical event. Similarly the government changed the rules on the banks before the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d. This rule made the banks look like they were failing, when the old accounting system would have shown them to be fine. (It is sad people do not know this.) You can even see how the stock market suddenly reversed course when those rules were changed back. It was almost instant. Economic freedom is expanding. People are fighting it, and successful in areas that are remaining poor.  Watch this video, it is very enlightening. (And timely too since it just came out the same day I am writing this.) You can look up the Economic Freedom Index, and will find that the US is at number 12. Interestingly while China is #100, Hong Kong is #1. When China took over Hong Kong they decided that they wanted to know why it was so successful, and took a hands off approach to their economy. From 1970 - 80 it's GDP grew by 8 times. Then it more than doubled by 1990, doubled by 2000, and doubled again by 2017. ",

However, many scientific reaserches would need to move into the poor area are and drastically change environment. Economic research is conducted by many economic institutions. Wall Street and the Federal Reasearch continuously do economic research. Economic reasearch is regarded as conducted as scientific method. Concept of economics' goal is toward creation of wealth (Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations), and, not toward poverty. \"Evil\" leaders and \"evil\" governments negatively interfere with general population creation of wealth (economics) __thus poverty. The world needs to economically conduct economic business as a \"free market economy!\" ",

            "answer_text": "Of course you can To do so I would advise studying the science of praxeology, and its most advanced arm - economics. In studying this science you will quickly find that the only path from poverty to wealth is one of capital accumulation and a steady expansion of the division of labour. We (economists) have been telling you this since 1755. Get it through your dam heads already. Little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice; all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things. - Adam Smith ",
