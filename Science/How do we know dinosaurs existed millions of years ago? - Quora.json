            "answer_text": "An answer has told you about Hutton and geological layers. A very important dating method uses radioactive decay. Radioactive materials decay at a known rate. We usually describe the \u2018half life\u2019. This is where an unstable isotope gives up atoms at a known rate and this slowly changes into something more stable. Radioactive carbon is a good example. This has a half life of 7000 years or so. It is constantly being made in the atmosphere, and then some is incorporated into the tissue of living things, which all cycle carbon. When that organism dies, it no longer takes in new radioactive carbon. So if we find long dead matter that was once alive, we can compare how much radioactive carbon is in the tissue compared with how much can be expected in something alive today. This allows us to give quite an accurate date for when the tissue died, but only up to about 50,000 years or so because after that, most of the radiocarbon has gone. Luckily there are other radioactive materials with longer half-lives, and these allow us to date the material to much older dates, though with less and less precision. Since the geological record and the radioactive matter within it are complementary, we can date in both directions. Some radioactive dating methods can date minerals, because for some minerals, the radioactive material was created at the same time as the mineral. If we find a fossil, which is the mineralised remains of what was once bone, and in the same location or in the fossil itself we can use a radio active dating method, then we can date the fossil. This science is so advanced, and our knowledge of the geological record of the Earth had progressed so much, there is no doubt as to the age of dinosaur fossils, and all are older than about 65 million years.

            "answer_text": "We can never be 100% sure. It\u2019s possible that the world as it looks today was created 125 years ago in (more or less) its current form, and that all of the things that we see as historical artifacts were doctored to look that way by a mischievous and dishonest creator. But all available evidence objectively points to dinosaurs having existed. We have fossils of their bones. We have evidence of their meals. We have evidence of their feces. We have evidence of them being injured by attacks from dinosaurs and other animals, and healing after the fact. We have evidence of their parental behavior. We have evidence of their reproducing and dying. We have evidence of their trackways in mud. If your skepticism is sufficiently boundless that you\u2019re willing to disregard all of these lines of evidence and suggest that these data points are not what they seem, then it\u2019s a wonder that you can function normally as a human being. You\u2019d need to be skeptical of quite literally every observation one could ever make with your sense organs. ",
