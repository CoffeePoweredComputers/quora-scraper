            "answer_text": "According to the latest I\u2019ve read from the experts, there\u2019s no counting them. They\u2019ve all (from around the world) already counted over a million cases and they\u2019re fully expecting a new, more serious wave to hit in the fall. I heard Fauci say that the second outbreak will see a much higher contagion and death rate due to the easing of restrictions and states reopening too soon. It\u2019s just a bad situation for all of us to be in. I know as well as anyone that we need to get back to work; I need to get back to work, and I need my business to reopen. But I\u2019m not willing to die to do either. I have three pre-existing conditions that make me an especially vulnerable candidate for serious illness or death from Covid-19; I\u2019m fully aware that we all have to die sometime, but I don\u2019t want to do it now, and I don\u2019t want it to happen while I\u2019m attached to a ventilator because I can\u2019t breathe. The federal government is a joke during this time. They\u2019re no help at all. I\u2019m listening to the experts and to our governor, who really has been working his butt off to keep Maryland both as safe as possible and as well-equipped for a new and more severe outbreak by doing anything and everything he can to restock the healthcare systems and workers with an adequate amount of safety equipment and ventilators and space to use in the event the hospitals can\u2019t take the overflow. Larry Hogan is a Republican\u2014the first GOP governor in Maryland history to be re-elected\u2014but he\u2019s not a Trumpster, nor does he care what Trump thinks. Even Democrats like him because he doesn\u2019t play partisan politics, ever, and he cares first and foremost about the people of Maryland. He\u2019s taken a lot of criticism from Trump because of his refusal to reopen until the numbers align with what the experts recommend, and he doesn\u2019t care. He will not let Maryland die. I\u2019m unaffiliated so I\u2019m not a Republican or a Democrat, but I lean left politically and I love Hogan. It\u2019s rare, especially now, to find a leader who actually cares more about the people they\u2019re supposed to be serving than they do about their party\u2014-and particularly about what Trump thinks as opposed to what\u2019s best for the people. I have to admit that I get annoyed with all these protesters toting their AR-15s and waving \u201cDon\u2019t Tread On Me\u201d flags and storming the steps of state Capitol buildings, claiming that their \u201crights are being taken away\u201d by their state governments\u2019 imposing mandatory lockdown or restrictions when they\u2019re out of their homes. Nobody\u2019s \u201crights\u201d are in any danger of being taken away. This is not a permanent situation, and their (and everybody\u2019s) \u201crights\u201d end where someone else\u2019s begin. They do not have the \u201cright\u201d to expose themselves (deliberately) to a killer virus and spread it to anyone they come into contact with; everybody else has the \u201cright\u201d to live, too. But it doesn\u2019t really surprise me that these people are doing this; most of them are Trumpsters, and Trump wants the economy back. Period. At any cost. It\u2019s the only thing he has to run on in November. It doesn\u2019t matter to him if 70% of the country dies as long as the economy gets better. He\u2019s stupid, because he ought to care; some of the most vulnerable people to infection and death are his own voters. If they\u2019re all dead by November 3, he\u2019s not going to have enough sheep in his flock to win. He\u2019s been pushing and prodding the states to reopen even as their contagion and death rates spike, and he obviously takes the side of all these \u201cliberty\u201d morons who, I think, just really don\u2019t get why reopening before we\u2019ve flattened the curve is a bad idea. They\u2019re only thinking of themselves\u2014just as their lord and master is telling them to do. Now that it\u2019s been proven that the White House is as likely to breed infection as anywhere else, maybe he\u2019ll change his tune\u2014but I doubt it. Trump would rather see the inside of the Oval Office again, even if the very people who support him are in body bags stuffed into refrigerator trucks\u2014which will mean that there\u2019ll be fewer and fewer people willing to defend whatever he screws up. But he doesn\u2019t have enough smarts to see the big picture. The way he\u2019s trying to politicize this deadly pandemic is so far removed from what a \u201creal\u201d president would do in a situation like this that more and more people who used to be behind him are seeing the mistake they made\u2014maybe, finally, some of them will wake up. His base won\u2019t; they think he.\u2019s God\u2019s Chosen. But some Republicans with still-functioning brains might\u2014we\u2019ll just have to hope. But back to the question, states all over the country are reopening too soon. The experts are 99% positive that the coronavirus is going to spread a lot more\u2014-and that the results are much worse than they were this time\u2014as states whose stats haven\u2019t improved yet reopen and the second wave hits. I completely understand that the economy needs to get going again, but what all these \u201creopeners\u201d don\u2019t seem to realize is that it\u2019s not going to help the economy if nobody feels safe going into these establishments and spending money on whatever they\u2019re selling. The latest polls show that a huge majority of people are still staying home despite the relaxation of the directives. Nobody feels comfortable eating at a restaurant or going to the movies or shopping at retail stores or even going to get a haircut, as much as they feel they need one. The CEOs and owners of some businesses that opened the first weekend in May complained that the businesses had lousy consumer responses that weekend. If nobody comes in to spend money (and if the 20% of the population that\u2019s now unemployed don\u2019t have any money to spend), it\u2019s not going to improve the economy much\u2014-and if reopening facilitates a second, even more virulent wave of Covid-19, which all the disease-control experts say is going to happen\u2014they\u2019re just going to have to close again, probably for good this time. Reopening businesses doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to prosper, and if they don\u2019t, they\u2019re going to lose investors as well. My personal opinion is that we need to focus most on finding a successful treatment for covid-19, rather than racing to find a vaccine. This kind of coronavirus isn\u2019t going to go away any time soon; a vaccine that absolutely protects people from getting it is a very long way away. I think we\u2019re going to just have to adjust ourselves to living with the coronavirus in our midst, the same as we had to do when HIV first appeared. If adequate testing and contact tracing can be developed and if we just realize that social distancing is \u201cthe new normal\u201d for now, then once an effective treatment is found so that it\u2019s no longer \u201cdeadly,\u201d we\u2019ll be able to open the economy and not have to resort to lockdown measures or lose any more lives. Certainly we need a vaccine and I doubt that they\u2019re going to stop working on one, but\u2014given the experts\u2019 opinions that that\u2019s going to take a lot of time and that, even were one to be developed, it\u2019s going to need to go through a long and complicated testing and trial-and-error procedure\u2014a successful treatment for covid-19 is going to be of much more help when it comes to learning to live with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is still out there and probably will be for some time. Let\u2019s all just hope that that happens soon. I want to get back to living, too\u2014but \u201cliving\u201d is the operative word here. ",

            "answer_text": "Answered 11 May 2020  Added 2 September 2020: A recent hypothesis developed with help by artificial intelligence suggests that the virus may be hemorrhagic. It\u2019s called the Bradykinin hypothesis.  No one knows because no one is certain what is the nature and cause of this viral menace. A lot of conjectures have been put forward. Scientists at Scripps Labs wrote in Nature that the virus is natural and jumped species. It\u2019s a convincing report. Other less reputable persons have suggested the virus is a bio-weapon with a timer\u2014a telomeric timer that limits the number of iterations the virus can undergo before it no longer replicates. Those who believe the virus is a weapon are of two views: the USA developed the weapon but a Chinese agent stole it and transported it to Wuhan Labs where it was mishandled; the other view is that the weapon was developed by the Chinese at the Wuhan Labs where someone mishandled it. Another suggestion is that the virus is the infamous \u201cChristmas gift\u201d a certain world leader in the far east promised the Trump administration last year. Right now, all the evidence available to civilians like myself seems to confirm that the virus is a seasonal cold-like virus which\u2014unlike the common cold\u2014is virulent, deadly, and more contagious. The virus attacks repetitiously like a stinging bee until it provokes cytokine storms and other deadly complications like MIS-C (Multi-Inflammatory Symptom in Children) that eventually kill its hosts. As of today\u2014hopefully the future will overturn this dreadful fact\u2014the virus seems to incite no effective immunity-defense in its victims. If these ideas about the nature of the virus prove true, we can expect a dramatic seasonal decrease this summer followed by a dramatic seasonal increase in the fall or winter. During summer the virus will continue to spread asymptomatically. When it erupts during the next active season, the numbers of victims could be staggering. Without an ability to acquire immunity from the virus, designing a safe and effective vaccine will be challenging. We don\u2019t yet have a vaccine for the common cold though some say very smart people are working the problem. IN THE BEGINNING\u2026 Added 4 July 2020: Evidence for immunity has emerged in infected Chinese monkeys. China announced a vaccine on June 25 and is inoculating members of their military. China agreed on July 2 to partner with Brazil to test another version of a coronavirus vaccine they have in their arsenal. ",
