            "answer_text": "From a historical perspective, it is the other way around. Most of the disciplines that we now call sciences were formerly thought of as philosophy. When they developed their own hypotheses and techniques, they began to be known by more specific names such as \u201cphysics\u201d or \u201cchemistry.\u201d Isaac Newton, for instance, was known in his lifetime as a natural philosopher. The first person whom we refer to as a philosopher, Thales of Miletus, made the turn from mythology to philosophy by asking what the universe is really. His answer: \u201cAll is water,\u201d is fundamentally different from previous answers in that it requires nothing beyond the universe itself. The idea that the universe might be accounted for without reference to supernatural forces makes this accounting, in theory, verifiable. So, the first philosopher looks a lot like a scientist in his intellectual approach. Philosophy is the tree of knowledge and understanding; the sciences are the branches. ",

            "answer_text": "In what ways is philosophy a branch of science? Philosophy is not a branch of science. It is an antecedent of science. Even the origins of the word \u201cphilosophy\u201d refers not to science, not having an \u201c-ology\u201d ending, but to wisdom and knowledge. But towards the beginning of the formal establishment of the Scientific Method and even for a while afterwards, scientists were often referred to as \u201cNatural Philosophers\u201d as opposed to \u201cMoral Philosophers\u201d or simply \u201cPhilosophers.\u201d The reason philosophy can be considered an antecedent of science is because philosophy first introduced the ideas of logic and rigor as the basis for rationality and reason. Also, many of the earliest philosophers wandered into reasoning about man and moral considerations based on what they thought they knew about Nature. The problem was that, without yoking their speculation about Nature to a rigorous corroboration through observation and experimentation, these early philosophers often repeated Just-So stories with no basis in fact.
