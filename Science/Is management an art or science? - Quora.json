            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an Art The question of whether management is an art or science is quite old. When viewed as an art, management is remarkable, but natural expression of human behavior. It is intuitive, creative and flexible. Managers are leaders and artists who are able to develop unique alternatives and novel ideas about their organizations needs. They are attuned to people and events around them and learn to anticipate the turbulent twists and turns around them. However, artistry in management is neither exact nor precise. Artists interpret experience and express it in forms that can be felt, understood and appreciated by others. Art allows for emotion, subtlety and ambiguity. An artist frames the world so that others can see new possibilities. Science is extraordinary. It is a method of doing things. It is the organized systematic expertise that gathers knowledge about the world and condenses the knowledge into testable laws and principles. When science is done correctly, it can advice us in all of our day to day decisions and actions. Management is basically an art which can be made efficient by scientific methods. The artistic talents of the manager can be enriched by the usage of scientific tools. However as the famous quote \u201cA fool with a tool is still a fool\u201d, the artist in any manager definitely has an edge. His creativity and productivity can be magnified by using the correct scientific methods. The art of management existed long before automation. Without doubt, the science has made the management easier. But focusing only on the science may lead to shift of focus of the entire team and create overheads. Success of managers depends on how effectively they can use the scientific aid to enhance their artistic skills.  It\u2019s a Science Einstein said: \u201cIntellect\u2026has\u2026no personality, it cannot lead, it can only serve\u201d From the original five dimensions (inconsistently referred to throughout the book as dimensions, domains or abilities \u2013 the use of the word \"abilities\" will be utilized for this review), the authors have simplified these into four: 1. Self-awareness 2. Self-management 3. Social awareness 4. Relationship management All four are closely related and build on the preceding ability, but it begins with self-awareness. Self-awareness helps us recognize emotions in others. Good, resonant leaders have the ability to manage their own emotions to do and say the appropriate things at the appropriate time. Possessing a social awareness \u2013 being aware of how others feel individually or in a group \u2013 creates empathy, which is crucial for relationship management. The four abilities have been defined into 18 competences. The authors argue that these competences are not innate talents, but learned abilities. From the four abilities and the 18 competences, people can identify their own abilities and competences. The authors have found that no leader has an across-the-board set but, rather, a critical mass of a selection of abilities or competences. Management is a set of activities (including planning and decision making, organizing, leading, and controlling) directed at an organization's resources (human, financial, physical, and information) with the aim of achieving organizational goals in an efficient and effective manner. A manager is someone whose primary responsibility is to carry out the management process within an organization. The effective practice of management requires a synthesis of science and art; that is, a blend of rational objectivity and intuitive insight. Good management is a mixture of art and science. Management as an Art is a practice that has been followed for ages (donkey\u2019s years!) by many noble-beings (were they called managers in the early era??) and has been unremitting since then...maybe the style has changed but the objective hasn't. Being an art, its practice to perfection was one of the most essential feature (sine-qua-non) that everyone was looking at. However, due to efflux of time, many realized that it wasn't important to be perfect BUT necessary to be excellent. If you aren't excellent, u better take a jump! Management as a Science always had (and continues to have) a 'Cause & Effect' relationship that has been practiced (did I say preached?) for time immemorial (well, still being very well practiced and preached in many companies!) in order to enable people to perform better (hopefully!) and understand the quantification (many-a-times distorted!) behind their performance. I guess, time has come for us to realize the importance of management BOTH as an art and science and to appreciate its co-existence within an organization. I truly believe that it is in the best interest of the organization to have a mix of both (art & science) in right proportions and at the right stage of the organizations' cycle in order to derive immense benefits from the use of managerial tools, techniques, practices, philosophies, processes & disciplines AND at the same time KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid!).

            "answer_text": "I believe that management can be studied and refined to a science. You can study what other great managers do, you can read the latest \"how to\" book to polish your skills and learn how to manage or handle a particular situation. Leadership on the otherhand is a very different matter. A friend of mine and I were talking the other day about Managers vs. Leaders and he made what I thought was quite a profound statement. \"Managers take a situation and find a way to fix the problem, Leaders see the situation before it ever becomes a problem.\" True Leadership is an art. One that cannot be taught or studied, but only learned. Through mistakes as a \"manager\" and years of trial and error, you discover what your talents are and what you have to offer your team as well as your peers. You discover what your team needs from you to become successful and you find a way to take them there. A manager will use their tried and true methods with each new set of employees they encounter, but a Leader will never steer his people to greatness the same way twice. Tavis Leaf, T-Mobile USA Edina, MN I believe that management is absolutely an art. Almost one can learn how to be a manager but the art of it is to become a \"Great Manager\". So, i strongly believe that management is a pure art. And i bring this management as a science to an art form. Management can be considered as both science as well as an art. Management is Science because of several reasons like - it has universally accepted principles, it has cause and effect relationship etc, and at the same time it is art because it requires perfection through practice, practical knowledge, creativity, personal skills etc. Management is both an art and a science. Management combines features of both science as well as art. It is considered as a science because it has an organized body of knowledge which contains certain universal truth. It is called an art because managing requires certain skills which are personal possessions of managers. Science provides the knowledge & art deals with the application of knowledge and skills. A manager to be successful in his profession must acquire the knowledge of science & the art of applying it. Therefore management is a judicious blend of science as well as an art because it proves the principles and the way these principles are applied is a matter of art. Science teaches to \u2018know\u2019 and art teaches to \u2018do\u2019. E.g. A person cannot become a good singer unless he has knowledge about various ragas & he also applies his personal skill in the art of singing. Same way it is not sufficient for manager to first know the principles but he must also apply them in solving various managerial problems that is why, science and art are not mutually exclusive but they are complementary to each other (like tea and biscuit, bread and butter etc.). The old saying that \u201cManager are Born\u201d has been rejected in favor of \u201cManagers are Made\u201d. It has been aptly remarked that management is the oldest of art and youngest of science. To conclude, we can say that science is the root and art is the fruit. ",
