Only if \u201cwe\u201d can persuade the vendors of carbon-based fuels to reduce their CAGR of 2% in revenues to something that could have an actual effect. Dropping that CAGR by 0.1% a year would be a great start, but they\u2019re very unlikely to agree to that without way more pressure than to date. If \u201cwe\u201d can\u2019t persuade them to even that slow a rate of reduction, then \u201cwe\u201d will without any doubt whatsoever hit 3 or even 3.3 C (6 F) above preindustrial by 2100, averaged over enough years to take the Republicans\u2019 chant of \u201cclimate is always changing\u201d into account. (They\u2019re right about that, but those changes are all decadal or faster, and are irrelevant to the big picture for 2100.) Those vendors aren\u2019t going to take \u201cwe\u201d lying down. Already there have been rumors of wars about this. Between now and 2100 these rumors are very likely to become more than just rumors. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. But it will take a huge effort. The term Global Warming has been dropped in recent years simply because many people did not really understand what it meant, saw a cold winter, and said: \u201csee, not warming up!\u201d But it was a useful term because of the word \u201cGlobal.\u201d Climate change is a global phenomenon. It might produce different effects in different places, but it is caused by a simple global problem - too much greenhouse gasses like Carbon Dioxide, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide. These trap heat and cause the entire planet to warm, changing the climate - not just how hot it is, but how it works. So, to solve the issue, the solution will have to be as complicated and global as the problem. Reforestation on a huge scale.Changing the way we farm (traditional rice paddies, for instance, emit a lot of greenhouse gasses, as do cows!)Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, manufacturing, and so on.It will take a huge rethink on how we operate our entire society across the world because what one society does, affects every other society. A global problem needs a global solution. ",

EGMI maximises left brain use, I only want when what I really need now which has halved my pollution one can only make as much CO2 as one has money to spend. ",
