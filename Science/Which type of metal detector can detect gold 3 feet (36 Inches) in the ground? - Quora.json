            "answer_text": "You\u2019d want one of the newer Pulse Inductor type of metal detector. It can go up to 2 feet beneath the ground, plus. Or go really high-end, the Minelab GPZ 7000 Gold Nugget Metal Detector. But you\u2019ll pay $8000 for the privilege. It\u2019s heavy (almost 7 and a half pounds). It can ONLY detect gold, nothing else. It is also a Zero Voltage detector, and works best in open areas with very little other metal trash. There is a YouTube video on it here: (from nuggethunter)  After the review, he talks about a book he wrote called \u201cFists Full of Gold\u201d, but he covers the entire review before that. ",
