            "answer_text": "I think that your question can be interpreted in 2 ways. The first, do we really need electricity and what it provides? And the second, do we really need electricity as the most spread form of energy?  For the first interpretation I'll try to answer you with this perspective: pyramid of needs. Imagine that you had to stack your needs in a pyramid, filling it from the top, with the most important to the bottom, where only futil and frivolous things are. (Just to know, that was already done: Maslow's hierarchy of needs). In a basic human-like fashion you'll tell me that food and drink was your only needs, then sleep and maybe after that social relationships. Of course you know, world has changed and we rely on technology for near almost we do. Work, hanging out, light our house, read the news etc are things related to the use of electricity. I want you to notice that the need of \"food\" that we intend is different of the need that a prehistoric man would have had, since now we buy the food, we don't hunt by ourselves. What is the point? In order to keep a market open, make it work, light it up we need electricity. So eventually electricity fills our primordial needs nowadays.  For the second. We can imagine electricity as the energy that drives our instruments (I know that dimensionally it isn't an energy), other forms of energy are heat, mechanical and chemical. Those are intechangeable, since energy is always energy, but changes the form in which it is provided and how we exploit it. Electricity is a green, reliable, stable and feasible way of bringing energy to objects. It can be easily produced in a wide variety of ways, burning fossil fuels, exploiting winds or in the hydroelectric stations, and from there exported kilometers away. Current is also portable, thanks to battery, and it drives smartphones, watches, computers etc. because electricity is embedded to their working principle. you can use an engine to watch tv, but what it would do is convert mechanical energy into electricity (and a lot of heat), because as most of the technology of our days is structured with MOSFETs, components that require electricity and electric field to move electron and do magic.

            "answer_text": "Mankind lived without electricity for many thousands of years. So, we don\u2019t need electricity to survive. However it does improve and make better our living standards comfort and safety. As well as productivity. I do not see it being replaced with anything like chemicals, mechanics, hydraulics, light or pneumatics. I think its here to stay. ",
