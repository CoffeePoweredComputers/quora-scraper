According to its founders, the system simply sought the \u201cone best way\u201d to perform any task. But its time-study engineers, along with the assembly line, came to symbolize the bleak and mechanical organization of workers\u2019 lives by industrial engineers. Its advocates, on the other hand, hailed scientific management as the basis for the transformative increases in productivity that, they argued, improved the lives of working people. The main elements of the Scientific Management are \"Time studies Functional or specialized supervision Standardization of tools and implements Standardization of work methods Separate Planning function Management by exception principle The use of \"slide-rules and similar time-saving devices\" Instruction cards for workmen Task allocation and large bonus for successful performance The use of the 'differential rate' Mnemonic systems for classifying products and implements A routing system A modern costing system etc. etc. \" Taylor called these elements \"merely the elements or details of the mechanisms of management\" He saw them as extensions of the four principles of management. The development of a true scienceThe scientific selection of the workmanThe scientific education and development of the workmanIntimate and friendly cooperation between the management and the men.Read more: Scientific Management Theory by Taylor ",

            "answer_text": "The Scientific Management Theory is standard for its application of applied science at the assembly floor or the in operation levels. the most important contributor of this theory is Fredrick Edward Winslow Taylor, and that\u2019s why the scientific management is commonly known as as \u201cTaylorism\u201d. The scientific management theory targeted on up the potency of every individual within the organization. the most important stress is on increasing the assembly through the utilization of intensive technology, and therefore the mortals ar simply thought-about as adjuncts to machines within the performance of routine tasks. The scientific management theory primarily encompasses the work performed on the assembly floor as these tasks ar quite completely different from the opposite tasks performed among the organization. Such as, these ar repetitive in nature, and therefore the individual staff playing their daily activities ar divided into an oversized range of alternate repetition of same or closely connected activities. Also, these activities don't need the individual employee to exercise complex-problem resolution activity. Therefore, a lot of attention is needed to be obligatory on the standardization of operating ways and thence the scientific management theory set stress on this facet. for more info: Scientific management theory ",

            "answer_text": "Scientific Management  The concept of scientific management was introduced by Fedrick Winslow Taylor in USA in the beginning of 20th century. This concept was further carried on by Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, Henry Gantt, George Berth, Edward Felen, etc. Scientific management was concerned essentially with improving the operational efficiency at the shop - floor level. Taylor has defined scientific management as follows : \u201cScientific management is concerned with knowing exactly what you want men to do and then see in that they do it in the best and cheapest way.\u201d He is called as \u201cfather of scientific management\u201d and his contribution as the principles of scientific management. Taylor joined Midvale Steel Company in USA as a worker and later on became supervisor. During this period, he continued his studies and eventually completed his M.E. ( Master of Engineering ). Subsequently, he joined Bethlehem Steel Company at both these places, he carried experiments about how to increase the efficiency of people. Even after his retirement, he continued to develop scientific management. On the basis of his experiments, he published many papers and books and all his contributions were complied in his book 'Scientific Management'. ",

Frederick Winslow Taylor was a pioneer in the field of measuring performance of staff with a view to optimising it. He introduced \u201cScientific Management\u201d to industry. Frederick Winslow Taylor - Wikipedia Nowadays he is thought of by some as an old fuddy-duddy (or worse) timing workers with a stopwatch. But if you read his material you find he was a very thoughtful people manager. Since then the field of \"Scientific Management\u201d has exploded to meet an insatiable demand. However, if you consider that the great Pyramids at Giza were built thousands of years ago over a period of decades using an army of tens of thousands of workers, management theory has progressed at a very slow rate relative to science and technology in other fields (transportation, computation, communication, . . .). The notion that science has been able to revolutionise management in the same way those other fields have been revolutionised is an enormous overstatement. ",

He believed industry could benefit from a standardized approach. This approach is known as scientific management. Scientific management is still used today but has been debated, expanded upon, criticized, modernized and replaced (in some cases) with other (modern day) approaches such as the Contingency Thinking, Quality Management, Knowledge Management, and evidence-Based Management.
