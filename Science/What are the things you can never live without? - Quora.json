            "answer_text": "Apparently, my dignity. When I was a teenager in the third-world country, I once had a really bad intestinal infection from eating some grapes. So bad, I was admitted for a hospital stay. Unfortunately, so was everyone else it seemed. The hospital was not in the best of shapes before the epidemic. But now it was a certifiable hell. The bathroom looked so bad, I still remember it, decades later. It was like a violent surgical room painted with diarrhea shit and blood. There was no toilet paper or water either. Because of the condition of the bathrooms and weakness, everyone were using the bedpans right in the hospital rooms. Each housed about 10\u201315 people. The personnel was a little bit\u2026 strained. They also didn\u2019t have a dining area so everyone were eating in the same room. In any event, I refused to eat anything in that room or even use a bathroom and spent 12 hours straight sitting on a windowsill. Then I realized that I\u2019m just going to die that way but still couldn\u2019t make myself to get off. Finally, I walked to the nurses\u2019 room and asked to make a phone call. I called my dad and told him: \u201cI want to go home.\u201d He asked: \u201cWhy?\u201d I was surrounded by medical personnel, so I just said: \u201cI\u2026 cannot tell you. Just come and get me.\u201d Of course, my parents came right over and got me, despite the objections of the staff. ",

            "answer_text": "1.) Communication- The reason I say communication because if you\u2019re segregated, and isolated it will drive you nuts or make you go nuts if you don\u2019t have any kind of communication with people. 2.) Affection/ Attention- Affection.. let\u2019s people know that you care about them, and so affection is a \u201c need\u201d to want, and be loved in return. It\u2019s important to have that because if you don\u2019t.. then you\u2019ll be angry, and pissed off the world, and hating everyone in it. Attention- People that are neglected, and aren\u2019t getting attention can sometimes.. whine, and lash out and cause problems due to lack of attention, and annoy people. It\u2019s important to be a part of a person\u2019s life, and give them attention. Giving a person attention shows you care, and it goes with affection. 3.) Food- You need energy, and food to survive. Without food.. you\u2019ll be sick, and tired and.. other health issues. 4.) Shelter- Shelter is important.. because you need a place to rest, and cook and sleep in, and entertain yourself. 5.) Clothes- You can\u2019t walk out side Nude, and you need clothes to go places, and to secure yourself from cold or from heat. That\u2019s why they have winter clothes, and summer clothes, and other things. Not only that.. clothes ware off, and so you need fresh garments like Underwear, and bra\u2019s, and socks and caps on your head. They say the most sensitive spot on your body is the top of your head, and your feet. That\u2019s why so many people get colds, and sick easily.. when it comes the flu season. People don\u2019t wear socks on it\u2019s feet, and keep itself warm. I believe clothes is something people could not live without. Those are 5 things/ people you could not live without. ",
