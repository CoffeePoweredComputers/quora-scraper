            "answer_text": "The thing is, you\u2019re asking a question that can be set up in a number of ways. Generally, the brightest stars we see are larger than the sun, but how much larger depends a lot on mass and spectral type. Betelgeuse, for example, is a thousand times larger than the sun and 11 times as massive. It is also some 222 parsecs away (about 724 light years). It\u2019s an old star \u2014 near the end of its life \u2014 so it\u2019s a red giant that is relatively less dense and more diffuse. So it\u2019s so big and bright we can see it from all that distance. But now let\u2019s go to an even brighter star - Sirius, the brightest one in the Northern Hemisphere sky. Sirius is only 8 light years away, about twice as massive as the sun, and only about 1.7 times as large. It\u2019s a younger star than the sun, less than a billion years old. So it is brighter in the shorter wavelengths, and appears white and even slightly bluish to the eye on a very clear night. Now note the differences between the two stars. An average between them is not terribly meaningful. But we can say some things about the brighter naked-eye stars. Generally, they tend to be massive, more so than the sun, and larger, though the size varies a lot. Stars like the sun are out there, and there\u2019s actually quite a number of the same spectral type that you can see (though most are unnamed, they just have numbers). The only one that is named that I can think of off the top of my head is Tau Ceti. It\u2019s a 3rd - magnitude star in Cetus and is pretty unremarkable, and about 11 light years away. I am sure there are others. But since 6th magnitude is about the limit you can see with your eye, any sun like star past 50 light years or so will be really hard to find with your eyes. (The most distant naked eye star is Rho Cassiopeiae, 500,000 times brighter than the sun and 3,400 light years away, but it\u2019s only magnitude 5 or so, barely visible. The most distant \u201cbright\u201d star is Deneb, in Cygnus, at 1,600 light years, and 200 times larger than the sun). Most stars are pretty small. In fact the vast majority of stars in the galaxy aren\u2019t visible with the naked eye at all. What that tells you is the \u201caverage\u201d naked-eye star is probably going to be more luminous in absolute terms than the sun is, but that\u2019s not always so (Epsilon Eridani is smaller than the sun, but it is close by, some 10 light years away). Further, that means it\u2019s going to be more massive \u2014 again, not always, but mostly. And most will be larger, but again, not always. If it\u2019s really far away, it\u2019s likely to be larger. Close in, it can be down to sun-size or smaller and still visible. I hope that helps. ",

This is quite high for a star, considering the fact that most stars are of less mass than the Sun. The mean was probably brought up by the supergiants, which numbered few but had enormous radii, some of which were in the 800s. Now, 73.72 solar radii may be difficult to understand on a human scale, so I will convert it to miles. 73.74 solar radii is equal to 31,868,271.4 miles, or a little less than the distance between Mercury and the Sun, meaning that if a star of this size were to replace the Sun it would stretch almost to the orbit of Mercury.
