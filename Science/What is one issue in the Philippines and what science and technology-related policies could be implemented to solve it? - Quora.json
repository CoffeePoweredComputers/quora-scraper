            "answer_text": "Pollution.The Philippines is polluted because the people do not care. As a contrast look at Japan, which is an island nation with few resources. They keep their country clean as a part of their culture. Trash is sorted out in multiple recycling bins depending on type. What is not recycled is disposed of properly. The final waste is incinerated or used to fill in the ocean and create more land. In the Philippines trash is thrown on the ground. Where is ultimately washes into the ocean. No new technology is needed to tackle this problem. It needs to be a nationwide culture shift to care about keeping the Philippines clean. ",
