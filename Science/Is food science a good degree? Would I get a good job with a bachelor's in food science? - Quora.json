            "answer_text": "Food science is a great degree and there is demand for food scientists. You need a good background in chemistry, as well as a feel for flavors - seasoning, spices etc - and some knowledge of foods to do really well. I know food scientists that are almost 100% scientists and some that are very \u201cchef-like\u201d (less science, more the art of foods and flavors.) There is room for both in the industry and we need both to develop the best products for the customers. But in the end, food science is about science. If you are more interested in the culinary aspect, you might be better off just being a chef. There is a relatively new field within the food industry. It is called culinology. Usually culinologist have training as chefs - often with culinary degrees from a culinary school - as well as food science training - often having a BS in Food Science as well. I find this combination fascinating and it is something you might explore as well. See this website for more info: Research Chefs Association As to prospects with just a BS. Yes, you can find a job with a BS. In most cases you will start out doing a job similar or the same as a lab tech. In some companies, with simply a BS, you can still go far as you gain experience with products and manufacturing. These will generally be smaller companies with smaller staffs. But if you want to work for a big food company (Kraft, General Mills, CocaCola, Mars Candy, etc) you will need more than BS. With a BS in a large company you will probably never be much more than a lab tech. To really move up in most large companies as a Food Scientist, you will need a PhD most likely. As an aside, this is for Product Development, new product research or corporate quality. With a BS you could get a job in almost any food plant at as a shift line or area manager, QA Manager or some similar entry level plant managerial jobs. To move up from here, most companies would prefer someone with additional knowledge of either Business Management or Engineering (depending on your strengths). If you choose a facility near a college or university that offers appropriate programs, it\u2019s likely that you could work and go to school and get some help paying for classes. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Food Science offers opportunities to work in Industry or government. If you get good grades (at least a B average), do an internship, really understand the technical side of food and have a decent understanding of business and/or the legal environment, you'll do very nicely. You should have some passion for problem solving and a willingness to continue learning as well. The school you go to can be important, because you want enough exposure to different sectors of the food industry to both round out your knowledge and offer you some chance, should a desireable position become available in an area that you don't have direct experience in. The Institute of Food Technologists (ift.org) has lots of resources and you'll quickly be able to determine the schools that have good programs from the articles they publish and their memberdhip. Ask the student advisor about placement rates and destinations when talking to people representing a particular university. Good Luck and try not to amass too much student loan debt. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a good degree. It is a vast domain which consists of packaged and fresh food. Given today's fast paced lifestyle, scarcity of time has led to the demand for packaged or ready-to-eat food products. One of the largest economic activities in the world is the production and distribution of food. It is also expected that the Indian food industry will grow by $320 billion by the financial year 2020. With increased convenience, taste, nutrition, and variety, the concept of processed food is seeing a lot of innovation and change.Food technology is a science which combines nutrition, chemistry, engineering, and microbiology to manufacture foods that last longer. Food technology deals with the processing and preserving of foods. The study of food technology involves developing new methods and systems for prolonging the freshness of food products, protecting them from bacteria and other micro-organisms.You can start your carrier as:Product developerProduction supervisorProduction executiveQuality controllerProduction managerResearch director I am enlisting a few good Colleges that offer courses in food technology or food & nutrition: Mumbai College of Hotel Management and Catering TechnologyIndian Institute of Business Management & Studies - BangaloreLovely Professional University - PunjabPremlila Vithaldas Polytechnic (S.N.D.T Women's University)John Bauer College of Hotel Management & Catering TechnologyInstitute of Hotel Management, Catering Technology & Applied Nutrition - Kolkata ",

Food Scientist are in short supply and the industry needs a lot of them.Depending on where your passion is, there are several avenues you can follow and that will depend where you go from there. If you want to be outside of a lab, taking a class or two on manufacturing will help you communicate better with the engineers and thus be more succesfull. ",
