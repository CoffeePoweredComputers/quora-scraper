            "answer_text": "In addition to the websites listed in Joshua Engel's answer, I would suggest the following other options:  Papers based on research that has been funded by the NIH are required to be available in an open-access manner, and are listed in PubMed Central. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ If the topic you're interested in is biological or health-based, start here. (The NIH also funds a lot of basic research, so you will often find papers you wouldn't expect to here as well).Many scientists self-archive, that is, they keep .pdf copies of their papers and/or their proofs on their lab websites. If you know what you're looking for, go to the lab website of the scientist involved, you should be able to get a copy of the paper there.Email the scientist involved. Most people I know are only too happy to send an interested person a .pdf copy of their paper, if so requested. Most papers have a corresponding author whose contact information is listed along with the abstract. Send them an email.If you live near a major research university, visit their library. They will have access to an incredible array of journals and papers, both physically and online through university specific databases. You should be able to print out what you need there.",

Wait for someone to post your paper. (Here's the one I requested) Then do whatever you like with it!In my experience it takes about 20 minutes for someone to respond with your journal article. Sometimes the wait is longer. $4 - Read it on DeepDyveRent the article from DeepDyve, to read in your browser.1. Go to DeepDyve2. Search for your article (here's mine)3. Rent it for $4. \"Rental\" means you can read it for 30 days. No prints or downloads. $20 for 5 rental credits.Rental isn't an option for all articles. For instance, I can't rent this ACTN3 journal paper.A big mark down for Deepdyve: DeepDyve is horrible at telling you if an article is available for free somewhere else. I rented a copy of this paper (ACTN3 genotype is associated with increases in muscle strength in response to resistance training in women) from DeepDyve. When I clicked on their \"Buy from Publisher\" link, the paper was free online from JAP. In another case, DeepDyve said an article was \"Buy only\", but was free to download on Nature's website. I looked at 20+ results for ACTN3, and 80+% of them marked as \"Rentable\" were free from the publisher.But I want to like DeepDyve. If DeepDyve was more reliable about tagging \"Free\" journal articles, it would be my first stop when doing research. If the article was free, read it; if it's rentable, rent it; otherwise consider buying it. No more hunting around across so many websites! Would love to update this post in a few months and find that DeepDyve is much better. $30 - From the PublisherThe final option is buying the article from the Publisher directly. Normally the first result of a Google search is a link to the NCBI Pubmed website, linking to the publisher's site. My ACTN3 article costs $41.95. Yikes! In my experience prices range from $30 up to $60, depending on the Publisher. ",

I, too, fall in the camp that all academic research should be publicly available, but especially anything greater than 5 years old. Since finishing my graduate degree I have lost access to scholarly articles and miss that. So, this post will present this answer with two sets of links. The first set will be free journals or free databases giving access to free journals. The second will be pages that list sources of free academic research (I have not verified these).

            "answer_text": "If you are not associated with a university--where you could use the university library online--then check out becoming a member of a local major public library.  Major public libraries--Los Angeles, New York, etc.--often have good research collections, including online access to subject databases and full-text journals, which you can use as a member of the library.  You would input your library card number to get access online.  Also, rules differ from campus to campus, but often you can pay for an annual membership in a local university library, and be able to get online access that way.  Finally, though you may hate the thought, if you go in physically to a university library, even without any membership, you can usually do online searching of databases and journals right in the physical library, and print off references and papers there at no or little cost. As for strictly online websites: disciplines often have some database or repository you can use, but it varies by field. If  you are a computer scientist, you can get online access to the full text of all the dozens of ACM journals by paying a total of $198 a year for membership and access to the ACM Digital Library. ...or, you can go to your local university library in person and get access for free.

You can request papers at reddit.com/r/Scholar  2011 answer: Do some low-intensity research through your local university's astronomy or atmospheric science department (they often tend to be really liberal in giving UNIX accounts to users - including high school students [1]). They'll usually give you an account to store stuff in. Then set up SSH tunneling through the departmental account that you have, and then you can remotely read the journals that the university has access to. [1] At least at my university. I actually also got access to an Applied Math UNIX account too. I'm pretty sure this is similar across other universities as well - see Are scientists more willing to share data in some fields than in other fields?. If your university doesn't have astronomy/atmospheric science departments, then try a Physics, Applied Math, or Biostatistics department. ",

            "answer_text": "Welcome to the real world. We refer to these entities as Paywalls.  When you submit a paper, and it is accepted, the conference/journal (in most of the cases) shares the rights with the publishers like IEEE, ACM etc. There are such research publishers in almost every field of study. There's a lot of debate about this. There are few open access journals which let you get papers for free - and in turn they charge authors more than other publishers. There are very few good quality Open Access journals. Last week, Elsevier, a top research publisher announcd that it would be donating 45 free ScienceDirect accounts to \u201ctop Wikipedia editors,\u201d granting them access to thousands of paywalled scientific journals. However this outraged the scientific community as this can in-turn become an event that would strengthen the paywalls. If you're affiliated to a university or a research organization, they would have an institute account with most of top scientific publishers. Check your library and request them for access.  Another option might be contacting authors directly - doesn't always work. If they are super busy researchers, they might not even read your email. An alternative is to look into homepage of the authors - where they usually share the PDF versions for free download. Or Google the title up along with filetype tag e.g. filetype:pdf Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality Last, if you are still unable to find, request a peer who has access through the paywalls to help you find the required papers.

            "answer_text": "Unpaywall. They harvest Open Access content from over 50,000 publishers and repositories, and make it easy to find, track, and use. They're integrated into thousands of library systems, search platforms, and other information products worldwide. In fact, if you're involved in scholarly communication, there's a good chance you've already used Unpaywall data. Unpaywall is run by Impactstory, a nonprofit dedicated to making scholarship more accessible to everyone. Open is our passion. So it's only natural our source code is open, too. The Unpaywall database has a very simple structure: we have one record for every article with a Crossref DOI (that's about 95 million records all told). We harvest from lots of sources to find Open Access content, and then we match it to these DOIs using content fingerprints. So, for any given DOI, we know about any OA versions that exist anywhere (at least that's the idea). Institutional Repository managers can use Unpaywall data to find OA resources that faculty have posted online, without depositing in their IR. These can be automatically ingested, significantly increasing IR coverage without needing to convince faculty to deposit. Repositories of all sizes have used Unpaywall data in this way. Of course, this is just a very quick overview...if you have any questions, or want to use Unpaywall in a way that's not described in their website, please drop us a line and they'll be happy to help!

            "answer_text": "Free options: If you're only interested in a small number of papers then contacting the author(s) to request a copy for personal use can be effective. If you're looking for more general access then you can search the Directory of Open Access Journals. PubMed and other databases also allow you to limit your search to free papers. If you are eligible to join Researchgate , Academia.edu or Figshare you may be able to get hold of papers posted there by the authors. Searching university repositories using the Institutional Repository Search, or even just a Google search for the title of the paper can also yield results. Reduced cost options:Some professional organizations offer journal access as part of their membership package. In that case you would need to be eligible for membership, and pay the necessary fees, but it usually works out much cheaper than paying for papers individually or buying a subscription. DeepDyve has already been covered here. I've used it a few times when I was between institutional subscriptions, but often found they did not have the paper I needed. Still worth a look as they continue to add publishers. ",

This is a w0nderful site, which allows you to get most stuff (though not all): http://sci-hub.io \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 UPDATE, august 2016: sci-hub . io does not work, but sci-hub . cc DOES work. The academic publisher$ HATE sci-hub, and they are doing their best to shut it down. But as soon as they shut down one link, another pops up. Use the \u201ccc\u201d extension for now. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Also, you can try embedding \"sci-hub . io\" in the url of your target. Example: Say that this is your target: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih . gov/pubmed/26427314 Try this, inserting \"sci-hub . io\" after the domain: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih . gov.sci-hub . io/pubmed/26427314 ... usually it works! In the example, you have to click on \"full text\" link to get the pdf file. Also, you have to omit the blankspaces, which I inserted to get around quora's annoying habit of not displaying literal urls. ",

Because bundles multiple copies of the same article, it is often possible to find pre-print and author-hosted copies of paywalled articles.  The Directory of Open Access Journals is a global search index of OA journals, and hosts an article-level search. SCI-HUB.CC is the living mirror of sci-hub.io, a Russian piracy site for academic articles. (Elsevier got the dot-IO domain shut down[1])  AAAAARG.FAIL is the latest domain of one of the first academic piracy communities. As an ask-and-provide user-submission community, it's definitely biased towards the interests of the early-adopters of academic piracy (especially critical theory). This community stands alone as offering full copies of scanned books, and sometimes the only ebook versions ever produced of key texts (yes, people actually stand over a scanner to fulfill requests). I believe that it may be invite only now so it's worth searching the index to see if it has anything relevant before asking around for an invite.

            "answer_text": "The library, either public or the one in the nearest academic or other research institution is probably the best bet.  In addition, you can try various working paper repositories, such as arXiv and SSRN. Even further, you might also try authors' personal/professional websites and social networks such as ResearchGate or Academia.edu - Share research. Many publishers permit republishing of pre-prints, which have the same exact content than the published paper, on personal websites or institutional repositories either straight away or after an embargo.  Google Scholar search is actually quite clever crawling through the depths of the web and linking to any available copies. I suppose a disclaimer is in order though. To be on the safe side, please check your local copyright legislation re: your sources before accumulating a major cache of research papers. ",

The wonderful people and our wonderful emphatic fraternity of researchers know how crucial it is to have access to unabated flow of research articles at our behest. There are many Facebook fora where a anyone, not having subscriptions of journals, can put links of the desired papers and people having access share the publications with a lead time of average thirty minutes. Kudos to the good Samaritans. (Inserting links below) The second and more potent way is using sci-hub portal which is a pirated site having a success rate of 99.9%. Just paste the url of the publication on the sci-hub portal.

Research is a collaborative work and I don't understand the logic behind the subscriptions and other fees, as most of research scholars are unemployed with basic or no sapient money. If you have a great publication with restricted access, I'd say that it is a complete waste as a very meager percentage of research community can actually read or work upon your idea. Having said that, visit Sci-Hub to download research papers and articles for free. I'd say that it is a researchers heaven in the form of  an online repository of over 48,000,000 scientific academic papers and articles, available through its website. New papers are uploaded daily. :)  ",

They and others are aggregated at the Directory of Open Access Journals, http://www.doaj.org/. In general, Google Scholar (scholar.google.com) is an excellent search tool for free and non-free papers.  Often, the abstracts are available for free even if the paper is not, and for people searching just \"scientific\" papers rather than a specific field the abstract may be all you need. ",

For many other journals, the electronic copy becomes available after a certain period of time (say a year) so unless you need that paper that just came out last month, you will probably be able to get it. Some journals never make their stuff available unless you have a subscription (personally, I try to stay away from publishing in these journals if I can). And this is the big one. If you do a pubmed or google scholar search and see a paper that looks interesting to you, just contact one of the authors and ask for a copy of the paper. They will always oblige. Even if it's not quite the publication version of the paper (it could be a galley proof or an MS Word version), they will hook you up with a version that is pretty close to the final version.  ",

From Wikipedia: \"Sci-Hub is an online repository of over 51,000,000 scientific academic papers and articles,available through its website. New papers are uploaded daily after accessing them through .edu proxies. Founded by Alexandra Elbakyan from Kazakhstan in 2011, it began as a reaction to the high cost of research papers behind paywalls, typically US$30 each when bought on a per-paper basis. Academic publisher Elsevier has in 2015 filed a legal complaint in New York City alleging copyright infringement by Sci-Hub.\" You can read more here: Is Sci-Hub offline? ",

This has been a subject of debate for quite a few years and has resulted in the emergence of \u201cOpen access journals\u201d. These journals make their articles accessible to all, only caveat is that the publisher fee needs to be borne by the authors. Nevertheless, this concept is increasingly getting popular and there are a lot of OA journals these days. One can find the list of OA journals here: (go through the relevant research topic) List of open access journals - Wikipedia If you want non-OA journals for free, then either Share and discover research or Academia.edu - Share research could help if the authors have uploaded their articles to these websites.

You need to subscribe to them with a hefty annual fee. Without subscriptions, you will have to pay for each paper that you want to study and again, the prices are pretty steep. The abstracts of all the papers, however, are available free of cost. Of course, you can try Google Scholar and normal Google search. If you have a specific topic in your mind, once in a while you will get the desired publication. But chances of finding a quality publication from a reputed journal for free is almost nil. If you are associated with a university or research institute, find out if the institute has access to the aforementioned online sources, generally the good ones do.  If you are doing this thing independently, only legal option available is, paying for whatever you want. ",

If your local library doesn't have the resources you need then get an out-of-area library card for a great library.  For $25 per year I have access to many research databases including ebscohost from a library in Georgia USA. 2. Many journals offer free access for public libraries.  If you take a journal's information to a reference librarian you may be able to convince them to sign up.  My local library accepted my request for Physical Review Letters and will be adding it to their online resources this quarter. 3. You can try writing the corresponding author a request for the paper.  My success rate is ~70% with this.  Keep the emails short and courteous. 4. You can search for the author's homepage or CV.  Many will have links to published papers. Best of luck. ",

If the paper you are interested is in a journal that charges readers, I know of two other options. (1) In many fields (Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance, and Statistics) it is common for authors to reprint their papers at arxiv.org. (2) You can write to the author and request a copy of their paper. Most paid journals do not prohibit their authors from sharing their paper with individuals, and I expect that many authors would be happy to help someone without a subscription to read their paper.

Some businesses will grant you access, i.e. because you're a student and they're associated with the school in some form, but you wouldn't be allowed to copy anything significant. Privately, not happening for legit stuff. If you are an engineer, I would highly encourage you to look at the ethics of downloading what amounts to pirated documents.
