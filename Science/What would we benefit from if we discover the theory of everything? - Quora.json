            "answer_text": "One of the immediate benefits would be to end the experiments that the theory predicts a negative result. For example, string theory predicts that an elementary particle that exists as a magnetic monopole can exist. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything reveals that it is not possible for an elementary particle to exist as a magnetic monopole. The negative results of trying to find one doesn\u2019t prove anything. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything also predicts that the LHC will never produce data in the way of smashing particles that will help in finding new math and a path to solve the theory of everything. Please refer to this paper entitled, Why Can\u2019t the LHC Find New Math? Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything does predict that a neutrino/anti-neutrino interaction will not result in the destruction of these particles because they are both composed of E1 energy. So the immediate benefit would be to stop wasting money on experiments that will get us nowhere. Finding the theory of everything would be important in planning new experiments because if something cannot be derived from the theory of everything, then it does not represent reality. ",

It refers to the balanced and tranquil state of mind in which the basic unity of the Cosmos is experienced. We would awaken to the basic oneness of the Cosmos. One could almost say the essence of it - is the awareness of the unity and mutual interrelation of all things and events, the experience of all phenomena in the world as manifestations of a basic oneness. All things are seen as interdependent and inseparable parts of this cosmic whole; as different manifestations of the same ultimate reality. Wellness though Oneness\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Not much benefit from the discovery BUT lots of extraordinary benefits if the theory allows us to make more efficient and creative use of nature. It is, of course, the use that we might be able to make of such a theory that enables mankind to progress. Some successful theories are more useful than others. Theories that predict new effects that can be utilised widely are much better than those that give nothing new. It may be that reality is boring and has no more surprises for us but, more likely, surprises are almost always hidden just beneath the surface. Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism gives us a theory predicting email radiation and all that follows. ",

Then we would realize the \u201cTheory of Everything\u201d is incomplete. So our Theory of Most Things while very useful will not be the end all. The entire universe is a very big place. So big we haven\u2019t been able observe most of it. In fact so big the mere speck of time we have had to observe has clouded our objectivity. We believe we have been able to see enough to extrapolate universal knowledge. I know this may be an unpopular opinion, but hubris doesn\u2019t accept that which does not fit into the current meme.

It isn\u2019t really a theory of \u201ceverything\u201d, it\u2019s a theory that combines quantum mechanics with relativity and thus accounts for all the fundamental \u201cforces\u201d of nature as far as they\u2019re known. If physicists succeed in finding a TOF, they will rejoice. The immediate practical implications aren\u2019t clear but I would assume some of the first things to show up would be improvements in electronics and power sources. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely nothing. The search for the TOE is a pure academic search. We already cannot make use of the heavier side of the standard model (charm, strange, bottom, and up quarks; the tau lepton; the Higgs; ). Anything we learn new from the TEO must be in scale order of magnitude smaller then the standard model, hence completely out of reach of technology. You can claim about the indirect effect of the search itself (educating students than moves into other fields, the merits of the search on the society etc). However I seriously doubt if such effect can be truly measured to a narrow field of science as the TOE. ",
