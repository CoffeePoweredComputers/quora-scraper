They do a lot of work. Without them life in the lab would be very difficult. I've worked with technologists who mistreated technicians and it infuriated me. My ass had been saved on many occasions because of the help from an assistant. I think it's just as thankless of a job as a technologist, but I think they're invaluable. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the type of lab and the setup of the lab. Every PI likes to structure their lab in a certain way. Responsibilities vary greatly and are based on the years of experience and knowledge of the lab tech. In some labs, lab tech\u2019s responsibilities might be to clean glassware and prepare solutions for everyone in the lab, keep inventories of reagents, order said reagents or work with the lab manager to place orders, prepare safety reports, clean and maintain biohazard bins, sharps bins, etc. In other labs, a lab tech might be hired specifically for helping a grad student or a postdoc with a project, which may entail everything - from preparing solutions to running the experiments to analyzing said experiments and generating data. A lab tech might also be an animal tech, which is a bit more specific as it requires specialization in the maintenance and work with lab animals. ",
