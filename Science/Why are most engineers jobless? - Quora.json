It need lot of talent, hardwork an also so much of attention and most importantly planning. if you have these three things you will not be jobless after being an engineer.

Overall just think yourself as a CEO of any company and what would you like to have the qualities in an engineer whom you are hiring you will get all off tour answers.. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello\u2026 It is not like that all engineers are jobless. If this is so, then all these MNCs would have been gone in vain. The guy having knowledge about the department in which he or she had completed engineering is not jobless. In india, there are many startups are establishing. A guy can easily get a job of his choice. The problem is that everyone wants to earn, rather than to first learn. Everyone is dreaming about the money and job. They are not thinking of how to earn it. The main thing is the knowledge regarding the destination. What these companies want in a candidate. First try to understand that. Simple agenda is that just fulfill there requirement and you are in the MNCs or your dream career in any sector. Best wishes. Thank you ",
