            "answer_text": "Your question is not clear. I assume it is how energy bands are created? In an atom the energy levels an electron can take are quantized. If two atoms come together the energy a single energy level splits into two levels. If n atoms come closer as in a metal, single energy level of atoms splits into n energy levels. Since, n is very large, order of 10^23 , single level splits into a band with nearly continuous levels. This is called band splitting. a model called \u201cKronieg Penny model\u201d describes this situation in terms of quantum mechanics. ",
