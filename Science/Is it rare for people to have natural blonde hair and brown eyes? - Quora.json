            "answer_text": "No\u2026. I'm natural blonde with brown eyes. My younger brother was blonde w/brown eyes,and we often got mistaken for twins even though I was older by 2yrs. My best friend of 20 years is also blonde with brown eyes and we often get mistaken for sister or cousins. Even one of my exs, hes blonde and has brown eyes (thankfully we didn't look alike \ud83d\ude06)I also knew/know a few other blonde w/ brown eyes . It's not AS common per say but far from rare. It's simple genetics. Eg. My dad is blonde hair grey green eyes (which I would of loved to inherit lol) while my mother is brunette and has brown eyes. Both blonde and brown eyes are the two dominant genes one of each I inherited from both my parents\u2026. To be honest my mom was so happy she had a little dark haired girl the day I was born but until I was like 3 months old and it all fell out and I've been naturally blonde ever since. People often think I dye my hair blonde because my eyebrows are brown but that's also a common thing with natural blonde hair/brown eyed ppl other people don't seem to understand lol ",

            "answer_text": "Rare is relative. There are nations where it is more common than others. First off most people who have these traits are of relatively pure European ancestry and people of European ancestry (including places like North and South America) are only about 20\u201325% or so of the world, max. Blonds are a minority of Europeans, not a majority, at least among adults.  What country has the most girls with black hair and light skin in Europe?  Percentage of people with light eyes in Europe [1,600px \u00d7 847px] \u2022 r/MapPorn Based on this, it might be possible to find a lot of blond haired and brown eyed people in Northern France all the way to Russia (especially on the European continental side all the way south to Southern Central France, Northern Italy, the north central Slavic nations, on into Southern Ukraine and Russia. That seems to be the \u201cintermixing area\u201d of more Nordic (Northern Slav and Germanic populations) and traditionally Southern European peoples\u2026 In America, in the MidWest, especially in Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, it is not usual to see a brown eyed blond person.
