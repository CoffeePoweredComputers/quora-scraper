            "answer_text": "My last test was in 2007. I had just come of a fatal dosage OD on Wellbutrin, and was hospitalized, where they, ofcourse, did a complete neuropsych eval. This included a fMRI which showed damage to my prefrontal Piariatal lobe, everything alse normal.So, what I remember from the IQ test was that there is a lot of problem solving, two in particular - a series of pictures that you had to arrange into a coherent story, and one where you had to arrange cubical blocks to match a pattern. These, esp the story comprehension, seem to be deeper than mere problem solving.However, yeah, the blocks are pure matching ability. Also, where I did the best, was verbal comprehension - they just kept presenting increasingly difficult words, and I defined them. Then, and if it wasn\u2019t for this, I bet I would have scroed higher - they had pictures of faces that they went through, some with different expressions - maybe - and man, I failed that one very badly. The result in the report was that I had extreme difficulty remembering many faces, but that the ones I did, I was very sure of.Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve had that one, but there must be 20 - 30 faces they show you(so it seemed, it was probably only 2 lmao) and I used to always, like the rest of us, see people we hadn\u2019t seen for years, and recognize them - or they rang a bell.I find that practice of people carrying around little bells a ringing them to be immensly irritating after a while, and I wish they would quit it.you guys do know I slip humor in, I am not insane, I think? In any event, I\u2019m a 6294576 on the sanity scale so it means something. Okay, back to my answer. I AM JUST DOING THIS BY MEMORY, WHICH WAS IMPAIRED AT THE TIME, SO I CAN GIVE AN IMPRESSION OF WHAT STUCK OUT FOR ME AS MOST RELEVANT, I GUESS, IN THE TEST. I WANT AN UNADULTERWD RECOLLECTION, A SUBJECTIVE RECALL = STRONGER FEELINGS AND MEANINGS = TO CONVEY WHAT IT WAS LIKE AND THEREFORE, WHAT I RECALL AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS. THIS WAY, I AM NOT GOING TO BE BIASED BY LOOKING UP THE WASSERMAN III AND THEN REMEMBER - OH YEAH! THAT HAPPENED, THIS HAPPENED, AND DARN IT, IT IS ABOUT PATTERN REC AND MATCHING! Like, the face test, - matching ability?? Hhmmm\u2026 Maybe, sure, faces are patterns, but it\u2019s way deeper than that. Man, it was two days long, I think 4 hours each day. ANYWAYS: I also got a clock speed! I\u2019m a computer buff, it seemed funny. Mine was really quite low in comparison, probably due to residual effects. Okay, no, and although these tests are hugely culturally biased, I remember that even reduced to it\u2019s most simplistic and cursory explanation, the test evaluates far more than a few mere characteristics that amount to specific aptitude assessments. I\u2019m not defending these tests as anywhere within 8 parsecs of being complete or comprehensive enough to measure but a mere fraction of what and how we think. It\u2019s crazy. They\u2019re great for assesing, in general, who is smart - I mean, I have met high scorers that are dolts, yet so many people I\u2019ve met, and I don\u2019t know what they would score, but sometimes they amaze me with certain insights, common knowledge, and wisdom.THERE: 3 things that make us intelligent that I\u2019m sure aren\u2019t tested for. THEN: altruism, compassion, understanding, ruthlessness, confidence, - are all these noy forms of intelligence? Commitment, logic(pragmatism) actually that probably gets tested. EVERY SINGLE FACET OF OUR HUMAN PERSONALITIES REQUIRES INTELLIGENCE. ALL CONSCIOUS STATES REQUIRE INTELLIGENCE. Finally, I\u2019ll say that IQ tests, in my opinion, measure a lot more than those two, although I know what you mean by reduction down to two common denominators.I found, for instance, just having verbal tests is enough - it only takes one example to disprove a generality - to show that IQ tests are more complex than what you ask. Putting 12 cards of pictures into an order that makes a coherent story is far more complex than pattern recognition, and nothing to do with matching. No, I say they are fairly comprehensive. I think, I imagine, I\u2019ve experienced many people with high IQs, and they are smart almost always. There is some strong(I\u2019ll get massacred for that one) correlation to IQ scores, and overall intelligence.Yes, I think that quite strongly, high IQ means you are smart, in many numerous ways, to a very high correspondence. OKAY, JUST ANOTHER CONCLUSION I\u2019VE JUST HAD: Therefore, it does not matter what type of challenges there are in a test. Sure, i figure there are things that takes smarts, that aren\u2019t in the test, BUT, THE SCORE ON AN IQ TEST VERY STRONGLY(MY GUESS!) INDICATES A PERSON THAT IS INDEED, VERY SMART IN GENERAL, IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER EVER LITTLE TIDBIT OF MEASURABLE TALENT IS TESTED FOR, THE RESULTS CORRESPOND TO REALITY. It\u2019s just so many people just up and say this meme that fucking pisses me off in it\u2019s manipulative value(it sounds apparent, because it is true in a way, but it implies a false limitation that is a non sequitor. But, it just seems so apparent, no one questions it, and I want to see research, and logic, and examples proving it. Not one do I remember. THIS: \u201cALL AN IQ TEST MEASURES IS YOUR ABILITY TO DO GOOD ON IQ TESTS\u201dSo? That\u2019s beautiful!All getting high marks in High School proves is that you can get high marks in High School. I rest my case, finally! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends which tests are used. \u201cIQ tests\u201d like the ones found on the internet, are loosely base on Raven\u2019s progressive matrices. Raven\u2019s and Cattell\u2019s tests are about pattern recognition. There were the tests I had to take to enter Mensa. Such tests give a rough idea of people cognitive capabilities, with no cultural bias, for little money. The WAIS IV test, which is considered as the best IQ test currently available, is made up of many sub-tests, I think 10 to 15, testing many things, including general knowledge. One one or two of these tests are about pattern recognition. Tests like WAIS are much more thorough, but they take a lot of time and there is a very strong cultural bias. The purpose of such tests isn\u2019t just to calculate an IQ, but to identify strengths and weaknesses. ",
