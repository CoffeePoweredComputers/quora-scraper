But now that I understand the question, I wouldn\u2019t write an answer had I not already written one \u2026. maybe I\u2019ll delete it! I can\u2019t think of an instance in which serious scientists have to any great degree wrestled over whether an assertion of non-falsifiability is falsifiable or not. Surely we would normally take the focus off the assertion and try to bring up concrete examples of things that would prove the actual theory false? That\u2019s a much easier task. Then I think we usually find agreement among scientists, but perhaps not among non-scientists, who don\u2019t always understand scientific theories well and may mistake them for an assertion of absolute truth. I don\u2019t think most of what comes out of our mouths or pens or keyboards, even in a scientific context, is rigorous enough to withstand or necessitate this sort of second-order investigation. ",

            "answer_text": "Nonexistence of evidence is not evidence. It\u2019s null and void. So there is nothing falsifiable, nor non-falsifiable. There is nothing to test. So there is no true or false either. There is no test, and there are no results. Non-falsifiability is a claim of nonexistence. So it\u2019s the equivalent to the nonexistence of evidence. A statement is not null. That is why we can test it. But to say the result of null cannot itself be tested is stating the obvious. Of course we cannot test \u201cnothing\u201d. We can only await for \u201csomething\u201d. Nothing is true until God reveals himself. ",
