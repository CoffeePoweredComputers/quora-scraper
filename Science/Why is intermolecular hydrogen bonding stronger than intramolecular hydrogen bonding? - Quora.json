            "answer_text": "I think your question has been misinterpreted. You are asking about H-bonding between 2 groups on the same molecule not covalent bonds to hydrogen. examples are orthonitrophenol or orthohydroxybenzoic acid. Unfortunately the examples I found on the web don\u2019t discuss the H-bonds but the effect of the H-bonds on molecular properties between molecules and are actually erroneous[really incomplete with misstatements in the explanations]. O-nitrophenol has distinctly less intermolecular attractions than its para isomer. This implies to me that the intramolecular H-bonding is prevalent over the intermolecular in the para isomer and possibly stronger but other factors must be considered. Try comparing the properties of the o and p xylenes or o and p methyl benzoic acids[no intramolecular H-bonding]where there is no H-bonding but similar geometry differences. My feeling is that the stricter geometry of intramolecular H-bonding causes a more permanent attraction in both time and space so they are measurably stronger. At the moment I have no proof so I toss the proof to you; research it! Infrared stretching frequencies might be a place to start. ",

            "answer_text": "Intramolecular bonds are consistently much stronger than intermolecular ones, so this applies to hydrogen, too. Intermolecular bonds are still important, though, as they determine the melting and boiling points, and the density of collections of molecules. The intramolecular bond is stronger because the elements of the molecule remain in proximity to one another. The molecules in an intermolecular bond may happen to be in close proximity for a time, but are prone to move away, due to thermal agitation. This can break the bond. ",
