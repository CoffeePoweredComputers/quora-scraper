            "answer_text": "Its something like Gedankenschrifft or Algemeinenkeit\u2014 Something involving the feeling of a slight curve or departure inflected by a chain of four or five elements. We can interpret this from the combination of the Algemeine and relativity, or string theory and predictive modeling, and it is also similar to combining my objective knowledge formula with another formula I call the soul of science. There always seems to be some kind of figure-ground, a representation of concepts, broken by a deeper logic which is somehow penetrating, which rejects most of the categories within the figure-ground (call them unnecessary exceptions), and when the proper idea of this extra-logic or curve is in place, there is a subtle vision of four or five categories which somehow relate with the curve. However, since this is so vague, even if I were telling the truth, there are many individual philosophical and scientific models which give more information. This just happens to be my impression of what remains between systems. I suspect it may be more adequate, on a kind of multiverse model, to allow for multiple interpretations, since I have foreseen that each system, if perfect, necessarily holds its own separate standard of formal analysis. And it seems also worthless to accept any imperfect system on the grounds that it might contradict a perfect system, if one of the systems really were perfect. I suspect science has no way of assessing a perfect system, since what appears empirically true in the larger cosmos may not be as comforting as the correct intuitive translation or interpretation of data as it suits the human or post-human mind. At some point physics will likely become more psychological even than it is today\u2014and it will be desirable to have a kind of arrangement where there might be an exact metaphysics for every personality type, just for the hell of it, or even oftentimes for practical or interface reasons. In all of this, I am NOT being a relativist. So, I would say, I have tried to give a clue, but since it is clear that the systems I mentioned all have separate formal criteria for success\u2014-since even if somehow one or more of them is coherent, they are still different\u2014we may as well accept just one of them, or seek still further theories which may have a better formal arrangement. Perhaps ultimately Grand-Unified Theory will be a small dot or a small blot within a far larger scaleable and redefinable computer structure in which the concept of a unified theory is only one of many functions, all of them useful, and all interdependent and perfect. Anyway, you have my gratitude that you asked this question. I think it is an important subject, and one of the guiding lights as far as broader, less specific equations has got to be my method of categorical deduction, which, if it is true that cosmology still relies on probability, would likely result in greater applicability of general theries, at least re coherence, if it has not already been applied.

            "answer_text": "All theories have in common the attempt to coherently account for the phenomenon in question; they all attempt to consistently relate the available data with the proposed explanation. In short, the common feature among all theories is thus: consistent relational structure. Without that, there would be no connection between an explanation and the phenomena it endeavours to explain.
