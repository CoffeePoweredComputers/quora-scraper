            "answer_text": "Black Holes are one of the strangest objects in the Universe.  By the end of this post, we\u2019ll have our own black hole. Before we start building, it is important to know that it involves general relativity and quantum mechanics\u2026 Black holes were at first just a strange construction of General Relativity. Just because it exists in the mathematics, doesn\u2019t necessarily means that it exists in reality\u2026 But the good news is that Black Holes do exist ! Black holes are astrophysical realities!!! And we have ample evidence to prove it. But to create one of these astronomical marvels, Einstein\u2019s equations and descriptions of space-time, mass, energy etc. are not enough\u2026 That\u2019s where Quantum Mechanics comes to the rescue! So, let\u2019s cut to the chase and build a black hole! Here\u2019s the recipe\u2026 Firstly, find a very massive star, way more massive than our own Sun and wait for it\u2019s enormous heat to cook itself into a supernova!If you are impatient, you can turn up the core\u2019s temperature by bombarding it with Gravitational Waves. The act as a catalyst. It will happen much faster!In the final moments of the cook, increasingly chaotic fusion in the interior produces one element after another. For example, 2 H atoms fuse to give 1 He atom. 2 He atoms fuse to give 1 C atom and so on\u2026This cycle of frantic fusion goes on until an Iron core is encountered. The formation of that core represents The End of Exothermic Fusion!Fusing 2 nuclei absorbs energy rather than releasing it! Starving for an energy source, the core of our stellar core collapses on itself !Well, what happens at the atomic scale? Electrons are slammed into protons in the Iron nuclei.What we end up with is a Neutron Star! What follows this is a Supernova Explosion as the elements rebound off the super dense core! The Galaxy is now replenished with new elements!The leftover core, the Neutron Star is another Astrophysics Marvel. It\u2019s a Quantum Mechanical entity. We generally see them as Pulsars! If we can somehow add more mass to a Neutron Star, maybe throw another star at it, the star expands in momentum space. In position space, it actually gets smaller in accordance with Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle\u2026The more massive the Neutron star, the more denser it becomes, and smaller becomes it\u2019s radius! This is an example of a Quantum effect happening on the scale of a star!Until now, the Neutron star is above a critical size. By now, the space-time curvature near the surface is pretty extreme! Time passes considerably slower due to Gravitational Time Dilation.Now, things are starting to take shape!!! Below the star\u2019s surface, there lurks the potential Event Horizon (The surface of infinite time dilation). The Event Horizon doesn\u2019t actually exist as long as the Neutron Star stays larger than the would-be horizon.However, if we can increase the mass of the Neutron star, the actual size of the star shrinks and the Event Horizon expands like an inflating balloon. There would be a critical mass, at which the radius of the Neutron star becomes exactly equal to the radius of the Event Horizon! It is now, at this point, that the event horizon actually comes into existence and the neutron star submerges under it.If you follow these steps correctly, using the correct ingredients, then\u2026. Voil\u00e0  You end up with your very own BLACK HOLE ;) Footnotes: Check out my blog on Black Holes\u2026 https://messinwithblackholes.quora.com?share=396067ef&srid=1QOF ",

            "answer_text": " Black holes are formed when super massive stars die. To understand how a black hole is formed we first need to understand how a star takes birth, transforms and eventually dies out leading to the formation of a black hole. We know that Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and so large clouds of hydrogen and dust are randomly scattered across galaxies. It all starts when huge clouds of Hydrogen, other gases and dust particles come together. Stellar Nebula:  When this collection of gas and dust, referred to as a Stellar Nebula, is massive enough its own gravity causes it to collapse, it starts to fall in on itself and towards the center it starts getting denser and hotter. This center is the energy source and thus a new star is born. Protostar These newly formed stars are called Protostars. The core of the star continues to fall inward and the hot center starts giving out light and the star begins to shine. When atoms come closer and closer under gravitational pull, they come so close that the Hydrogen atoms start getting fused into each other to form Helium, a process that release huge amounts of energy.  At this point the energy being produces by these fusion reactions will be countered by the inward gravitational pull of the center. This is where the size of the star decides its fate. The smallest amount of mass required to sustain this state as a star is referred to as one solar mass, which is the equivalent of our own sun\u2019s mass. The larger the mass the more fuel a star has at its core and the higher the amount of energy produced from fusions. Slowly the fuel in the core, which is Hydrogen, starts running out. As the core becomes smaller and smaller it gets hotter and more energy is produced, this energy will start getting stronger than inward gravitational pull and eventually starts pushing the outer limits of the start outward. Red Giant  As a result of the rapid expansion the outer shell starts cooling, giving out a red haze. In this stage the star is called a Red Giant. When all the Hydrogen atoms fuse to become Helium the core runs out of fuel and the energy from fusion reactions starts getting lesser and lesser. At this stage the gravity takes over and starts crushing the core with even grater force. This immense pressure causes the Helium atoms to start fusing with each other forming heavier elements like Carbon, Iron, Silicon and releasing even higher amount of energy as compared to energy released from Hydrogen fusions. Supernova  By the time the star runs out of fuel again it is left a relatively stable core made up of these heavier elements. Because of lesser and lesser energy pushing the core outward gravity wins the fight and crushes the core instantaneously resulting in the outer layers bouncing off the core in a super intense explosion called a Supernova. The blast is so intense that it spits out the star\u2019s guts to large distances throwing away most of the elements formed in the process. The super hot explosion forms most of the elements we find in the in the universe such as Cobalt, Nickel, Copper. The rapidly spreading super hot material will form a Planetary Nebula and can be observed from earth. Some examples of this are the Cat\u2019s Eye Nebula, Crab Nebula.  White Dwarf After the Supernova explosion, the star\u2019s core is left with relatively stable heavier elements, in other words it is one big metallic solid, called White Dwarf . At this stage most stars do not have enough mass to cause their gravity to push further inward, so they burn out for a few million years and dies out a peaceful death. This is not the case for super massive starts, if the left over core\u2019s mass is higher than 1.4 times the solar mass (knows as Chandrashekar limit), the core will again be subjected to intense gravitational crush. Neutron Star  If the star is between 1.4 to 3 times the solar mass the inward gravity causes all the electrons to fuse with protons and form neutrons. . The electron and proton fusions release such a huge amount of energy that another supernova explosion occurs and eventually all that is left is a core entirely made up of neutrons. Singularity By this time the initial super massive star which was thousands of light years across is reduced into a super dense glob of neutrons the size of just a few thousand kilometers. If the white dwarf before the explosion is of a mass greater than 3 solar masses ( meaning the original star had a mass of 10 to 80 solar masses ) , the gravity is still so powerful that it over comes the repulsion between the tightly packed neutrons (neutron degeneracy pressure) and crushes the core into a single point of infinite density forming a black hole!  Black holes as we know them are not that common because at any of the above mentioned stages the end result could be different based on the mass of the original star. Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "A slightly different kind of supernova explosion occurs when even larger, hotter stars (blue giants and blue supergiants) reach the end of their short, dramatic lives. These stars are hot enough to burn not just hydrogen and helium as fuel, but also carbon, oxygen and silicon. Eventually, the fusion in these stars forms the element iron (which is the most stable of all nuclei, and will not easily fuse into heavier elements), which effectively ends the nuclear fusion process within the star. Lacking fuel for fusion, the temperature of the star decreases and the rate of collapse due to gravity increases, until it collapse completely on itself, blowing out material in a massive supernova explosion. If the mass of the compressed remnant of the star exceeds about 3 - 4 solar masses, then even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to halt the collapse and, instead of forming a neutron star, the core collapses completely into a gravitational singularity, a single point containing all the mass of the entire original star. The gravity in such a phenomenon is so strong that it overwhelms all other forces, to the extent that even light can not escape from it, hence the name black hole. Thus, the gravity of a body just a few times denser than a neutron star would result in its inevitable further collapse into a black hole.  Simulated black hole in front of the Milky Way  Although singularity at the the centre of a black hole is infinitely dense, the black hole itself is not necessarily huge, as is sometimes assumed. A black hole with the mass of our Sun, for example, would have a radius of just three kilometres (roughly two hundred million times smaller than the Sun), while one with the mass of the Earth would fit in the palm of your hand! Having said that, black holes can grow to great size over time as they assimilate more and more matter and even other black holes, and some do become extremely massive. Contrary to popular belief, a black hole does not just \"suck up\" everything around it in an uncontrolled orgy of destruction: it actually exerts no more gravitational pull on the objects around it than the original star from which it was formed, and any objects orbiting the original star (and which survived the supernova blast) would now orbit a black hole instead (an object would need to approach quite close to a black hole before being sucked in). The very largest blue stars may skip even the supernova stage, so that even their outer shells become incorporated into the singularity. By definition, we cannot observe black holes directly, but they can be detected by the gravitational effect they exert on other bodies or on light rays. This is especially easy to spot in the case of binary star systems where an ordinary star is orbiting around a black hole. In the early 1990s, Reinhard Genzel pioneered this work, using the then new technique of adaptive optics to plot and track the motions of stars near the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy, to show that they must be orbiting a very massive, but invisible, object. From the immense speed with which the stars closest to the centre of the galaxy are orbiting - millions of kilometeres per hour - we know that there is a \"supermassive black hole\" (known as Sagittarius A) at the centre of the Milky Way, with a mass of around 2 - 4 million times that of our Sun. In addition, in the Milky Way galaxy alone, there are many millions of black holes of at least ten solar masses each. Supermassive black holes lurk in the centres of most galaxies, forming the hubs around which the galaxies rotate. In fact, from observations of the intense radiation of gases swirling around them at close to the speed of light, we can infer that there are much larger supermassive black holes in the centres of other galaxies, some of them weighing as much as several billion suns. The black hole at the centre of a galaxy known as M87 has a mass estimated at around 20 billion solar masses, and may be as large as our entire Solar System. It seems likely that the early universe, in which very large, short-lived stars were the norm, was scattered with many, many black holes, which gradually merged together over time, creating larger and larger black holes. Observations have shown that is not uncommon for two black holes to swirl around each other in a kind of cosmic dance as their gravitational fields interact. The ripples in space-time caused by two black holes orbiting around each other - typically in a three-leaved clover shape or more complex multi-pass configuration, rather than the simple orbit of an electron within an atom, and ever-smaller and faster as the two objects inevitably approach each other - can be recorded visually and even audibly. Long and short gamma ray bursts In the case of the largest events, moments after the creation of a black hole, the heat and the hugely amplified magnetic field of the collapsing star combine to focus a pair of tight beams or jets of radiation, perpendicular to the spinning plane of the accretion disk. These beams focus vast amounts of particles and energy (of the order of a billion billion times the energy output of our Sun) away from the black hole at close to the speed of light. The shock waves of this massively enegetic beam cause gamma rays to be emitted in a phenomenon known as a \"gamma ray burst\" or \"hypernova\" event (so named because its energy and brightness dwarfs even that of a supernova, by a factor of upto a hundred million times). Gamma ray bursts are by far the brightest electromagnetic events occurring in the universe, and can last from mere milliseconds to nearly an hour - a typical burst lasts a few seconds - usually followed by a longer-lived \u201cafterglow\u201d emitting at longer wavelengths (x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared and radio waves). It is likely that collisions between neutron stars, or between a neutron star and a black hole, can also cause gamma ray bursts. Interestingly, it appears to be easier for stars with fewer heavy elements to turn hypernova and generate gamma ray bursts. That, and the fact that larger, more short-lived stars were more common earlier in the life of the universe, mean that the phenomenon of gamma ray bursts is actually rarer today than it was. Having said that, NASA's Swift Probe, launched in 2004 with a mission specifically to locate gamma ray bursts throughout the universe, is recording at least one such event each day, so these are not rare incidents. (It should be remembered that any supernovas or gamma ray bursts we observe today in galaxies, say, 9 billion light years away, actually occurred 9 billion years ago.) ",

            "answer_text": "In order to question you answer first we\u2019ll discuss something about Black Hole The black hole named Cygnus X-1 formed when a large star caved in. This black hole pulls matter from the blue star beside it.  An artist's drawing shows the current view of the Milky Way galaxy. Scientific evidence shows that in the center of the Milky Way is a supermassive black hole.  This image of Sagittarius A in the center of the Milky Way galaxy was taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  Sagittarius A* is the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. A black hole is a region in space where the pulling force of gravity is so strong that light is not able to escape. The strong gravity occurs because matter has been pressed into a tiny space. This compression can take place at the end of a star's life. Some black holes are a result of dying stars. Because no light can escape, black holes are invisible. However, space telescopes with special instruments can help find black holes. They can observe the behavior of material and stars that are very close to black holes. How Big Are Black Holes?Black holes can come in a range of sizes, but there are three main types of black holes. The black hole's mass and size determine what kind it is. The smallest ones are known as primordial black holes. Scientists believe this type of black hole is as small as a single atom but with the mass of a large mountain. The most common type of medium-sized black holes is called \"stellar.\" The mass of a stellar black hole can be up to 20 times greater than the mass of the sun and can fit inside a ball with a diameter of about 10 miles. Dozens of stellar mass black holes may exist within the Milky Way galaxy. The largest black holes are called \"supermassive.\" These black holes have masses greater than 1 million suns combined and would fit inside a ball with a diameter about the size of the solar system. Scientific evidence suggests that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit inside a ball with a diameter about the size of the sun. How Do Black Holes Form?Primordial black holes are thought to have formed in the early universe, soon after the big bang. Stellar black holes form when the center of a very massive star collapses in upon itself. This collapse also causes a supernova, or an exploding star, that blasts part of the star into space. Scientists think supermassive black holes formed at the same time as the galaxy they are in. The size of the supermassive black hole is related to the size and mass of the galaxy it is in. If Black Holes Are \"Black,\" How Do Scientists Know They Are There?A black hole can not be seen because of the strong gravity that is pulling all of the light into the black hole's center. However, scientists can see the effects of its strong gravity on the stars and gases around it. If a star is orbiting a certain point in space, scientists can study the star's motion to find out if it is orbiting a black hole. When a black hole and a star are orbiting close together, high-energy light is produced. Scientific instruments can see this high-energy light. A black hole's gravity can sometimes be strong enough to pull off the outer gases of the star and grow a disk around itself called the accretion disk. As gas from the accretion disk spirals into the black hole, the gas heats to very high temperatures and releases X-ray light in all directions. NASA telescopes measure the X-ray light. Astronomers use this information to learn more about the properties of a black hole. Could a Black Hole Destroy Earth?Black holes do not wander around the universe, randomly swallowing worlds. They follow the laws of gravity just like other objects in space. The orbit of a black hole would have to be very close to the solar system to affect Earth, which is not likely. If a black hole with the same mass as the sun were to replace the sun, Earth would not fall in. The black hole with the same mass as the sun would keep the same gravity as the sun. The planets would still orbit the black hole as they orbit the sun now. Will the Sun Ever Turn Into a Black Hole?The sun does not have enough mass to collapse into a black hole. In billions of years, when the sun is at the end of its life, it will become a red giant star. Then, when it has used the last of its fuel, it will throw off its outer layers and turn into a glowing ring of gas called a planetary nebula. Finally, all that will be left of the sun is a cooling white dwarf star. How Is NASA Studying Black Holes?NASA is learning about black holes using spacecraft like the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Swift satellite and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Fermi launched in 2008 and is observing gamma rays - the most energetic form of light - in search of supermassive black holes and other astronomical phenomena. Spacecraft like these help scientists answer questions about the origin, evolution and destiny of the universe. I hope your doubt is cleared. UPVOTE ",

            "answer_text": "What is a Black Hole? General Relativity predicts that any mass \u2265 Planck Mass (\u2248 22 \u03bcg), if compressed enough to fit within its Schwartzschild Radius (rS, see below), will form a Black Hole. rS, even for quite massive objects, is rather small \u2014 e.g., for Earth's mass M\u2295\u2248 6\u00d71024kg, rS\u2248 9 mm \u2014 and it takes enormous forces to make such hard-to-believe compressions happen. We have to reach for the stars to find those! A star can be said to be a free-falling natural nuclear fusion reactor, the result of huge masses of hydrogen gas, collapsed and compressed by gravity to the point where internal pressure and temperature initiates nuclear fusion of hydrogen (H) to helium (He), releasing energy in the process. The \u201cProton-Proton Chain I\u201d is one of several \u201creaction pathways\u201d inside a star, together liberating copious amounts of energy:  The gas masses surrounding the core exert inward gravitational pressure, which tends to compress the star (decreasing volume = increasing density). This pressure is balanced \u2014 in hydrostatic equilibrium \u2014 by an outward thermal pressure resulting from the fusion reactions in the star\u2019s core layers, which tend to expand the star, like this:  This \u201ctug-of-war\u201d between the outer and inner star layers continues in stages: as one fusion process depletes its available fusible material, reactions slow down, which makes gravity compress the core further (which increases pressure & temperature), initiating another fusion stage, and so on, (roughly) like this, all the way up to Fe:  When fusion processes have depleted even the material needed to fuse into iron, things get critical: So far, pressure and temperature created by the inward pressure required no other energy input to the core for fusion processes to continue. However, to fuse iron (and heavier elements) into even heavier elements, much more energy is required. Fusion reactions fizzle out, and eventually may come to a halt! As a result, gravity will \u201cwin the tug-of-war\u201d \u2014 the star implodes (gravitationally collapses \u201cupon itself\u201d) in a core collapse, which may have different end results, depending on the original mass of the star: it releases huge amounts of gravitational energy, explosively ejecting the material in the star\u2019s outer layers \u2014 some of it now fused to elements heavier than iron \u2014 into surrounding space, in the shape of dust and radiation, in a supernova explosion.  Adaptation of original image (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Explosion_and_implosion.svg) from Wikimedia Commons (User Fastfission). If the star originally had sufficient mass \u2014 the cutoff point is called Chandrasekhar\u2019s Limit \u2248 1.4 solar masses (1 M\u0298\u0298 \u2248 2.8\u00d71030kg) it may collapse to a point where its remaining mass is compressed to \u2264 rS for that mass, and that\u2019s how a BH may be born. That answers your first question \u2014 a BH is a chunk of mass, so compressed that its gravity creates a spacetime distortion so severe that within its event horizon, all possible geodesics lead straight to the BH center \u2014 nothing, not even light can escape this stronghold! What Exactly is the Black Hole \u201cEvent Horizon\u201d? An Event Horizon (EH) can be several things, but in the BH context it is synonymous with the BH Schwartzschild radius (rS). The formula for computing rS= 2GM/c2, where G = the Gravitational Constant. If all mass M of an object is compressed into a sphere with a radius = rS for that mass, it is a BH \u2014 by definition \u2014 and nothing from within the EH can ever get out of it. A BH EH is not a physical surface, it is simply the \u201cvirtual sphere\u201d defined by the BH rS. Since nothing \u2014 not even EM radiation (i.e., light) \u2014 can escape a BH, its EH is sometimes called \u201cthe surface of no return\u201d (for mass falling into the BH). Since not even light can \u201cescape,\u201d a BH is not optically visible, thus the moniker \u201cblack hole\u201d is a double misnomer, since a BH is neither black nor a \u201chole.\u201d What is \u201cEscape Velocity\u201d? Escape speed \u2014 a scalar, not a vector quantity \u2014 is the speed needed by a non-accelerating object in order to \u201cescape\u201d (\u201cclimb out of\u201d) the gravity well of some mass M, i.e., the more massive a body is, the higher is its escape speed. The general equation, giving the escape speed for any body of mass M, is ve= (2GM/r)2, where r = distance to the body\u2019s center of mass.  \"Plot of a 2D slice of the gravitational potential in and around a uniformly dense, spherically symmetric body. The inflection points of the cross-section are at the surface of the body.\" (Image and caption by AllenMcC, Wikimedia Commons). Imagine a gun being fired straight up from Earth\u2019s surface: In order for that bullet to \u201cescape\u201d Earth\u2019s gravity grip, it must leave the barrel (no further acceleration given) with a speed of at least \u2248 11.2 km/s \u2014 assuming no atmospheric friction and no Earth rotation (the bullet mass does not affect the ve equation). Why is a BH ve always exactly c? Why can ve never exceed c, regardless of BH mass? This may become clear when you consider that in order to calculate ve for a BH, you need neither its mass nor the value of G (\u2248 6.7\u00d710\u221211N m2/kg2)! Say you have a BH of mass M (some unknown value), you have no Internet access, and you have not memorized the values G and c. No problem! BH ve = (2GM/rS)0.5, and since the term 2GM in this equation is both dividend and divisor \u2014 recall the general equation to compute rS, above \u2014 they cancel, leaving only (c2)0.5 \u2014 \u201cthe square root of c squared\u201d \u2014 which (of course) leaves ve = c, for any and all BH M values. Is the Singularity of a \u201cBlack Hole\u201d Tangible? The BH \u201csingularity,\u201d like its \u201cBig Bang\u201d namesake, is not a \u201cthing,\u201d so the answer is no. In the BH (and BB) context, the \"singularity\" is the result of a math error, namely division by zero: The theoretical equation computing (for example) density (\u03c1) of the BH, from its mass (m) per unit volume (v), is \u03c1 = m/v. When v = 0 \u2014 at the \u201csingularity\u201d \u2014 we have a problem ... And a common misconception of this nonphysical situation is that the result is infinity. However, infinity is not a number! For an analysis of the \u201csingularities\u201d supposedly present in a BH and in the BB, see my short essay Apples & Oranges (Singularities Compared) .pdf. Is a \u201cBlack Hole\u201d Tangible? If someone (something) gets close enough to a BH to give it a touch, that something\u2019s a goner. For sure. So I\u2019d say, no: a \u201cblack hole\u201d is one of these universal intangibles! There is considerably more to all this, besides what I have briefly glossed over above. If you asked because you are interested in gaining an understanding of \u201cblack holes,\u201d follow the links provided (most point to Wikipedia articles). Keep in mind also that everything about \u201cblack holes\u201d is theory and hypotheses only (so far), and there is considerable differences of opinion even among heavyweight BH theorists (see my Excel worksheet, Black Hole Properties .xlsx). For more BH stuff, see When people talk about the width or size of a black hole, are they talking about the actual singularity or the sphere of its event horizon? About the hypothesized \"BH center singularity,\" see How can we get rid of singularity in a black hole? ",

            "answer_text": "In order to understand black hole formation in a comprehensive manner, you need to understand the death of stars, more specifically - Supernova. Although supernova formation is a detailed process, I will explain it briefly. There are two broad classifications of supernovae: Type I supernova : a star gains matter from a neighbour until its mass exceeds a certain limit.Type Ia supernova do not have a Hydrogen signature in their spectra. They are generally formed from white dwarves in a binary star system. One of the stars begins to accumulate matter from its companion and when its mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the electron degeneracy pressure within it cannot sustain the white dwarf. This sets off a runaway nuclear reaction within it leading to a supernova explosion.There are also Type Ib and Ic supernovae; excluding their details here.Type II supernova : a star, whose mass exceeds a certain limit (without acquiring matter externally) runs out of fuel and collapses.For a star to explode as a type II supernova, it must be very massive - in the order of 8 - 15 solar masses). After its core runs out of Hydrogen and Helium, this is what happens:- It gets a layered structure, with lighter elements like Hydrogen towards the outer region and heavier elements like Nickel and Iron towards the interior.- When the core's mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, the core collapses under its own gravity and begins to implode.- Eventually, the collapse stops and the infalling matter rebounds. This produces a highly energetic shockwave leading to a supernova explosion.Supernova explosions lead to a violent expulsion of most of the star's outer matter, leaving behind the core. What are the properties of this core determines what happens to the core and whether or not it becomes a black hole. After the collapse, the core of the star consists of neutrons - a very large mass held in a very small volume - held together by neutron degeneracy pressure (Degenerate matter) and repulsive neutron-neutron interactions caused by the strong nuclear force. However, this happens only in cores whose mass is below the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit (approximately 1.5 - 3 solar masses). If the mass of the core exceeds this limit, it will collapse further to form a black hole (exception is a Quark star). There are two other ways for a black hole to form: Primordial black holes during the Big Bang: Shortly after the Big Bang, densities in the universe were very high. Initial density differences in different regions can cause them them to grow under gravity leading to a gravitational collapse and creation of a black holeIt is believed that black holes can also be formed by high energy collisions. These theories are speculative and no conclusive proof is observed. (This was the reason for the worldwide scare created when the Large Hadron Collider at Cern became operational, because the experiments involved high energy collisions). These black holes would however be too small and would evaporate in about 10^-25 seconds.Also to note is the Schwarzschild radius -    the radius of an object so that if all its mass is compressed within that object, the escape speed from its surface would equal the speed of light. A neutron star (or the core left after the supernova explosion) would collapse to an object whose radius is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius forming a black hole. Please note that this is a very brief explanation of the whole process. If you are interested in all the details, start with the supernova article on Wikipedia and follow the rest of the topics from there. ",

            "answer_text": "Stellar Black Holes A star is massive.  The gravitational acceleration at the surface is... um, massive, too.  The star doesn't collapse under that gravity because the gravity is balanced by an outward force of radiation as the star burns its fuel.   However, one day the star runs out of fuel to burn and that radiation force disappears, leaving the star at the mercy of gravity.  After exploding as a supernova, it begins to condense.  If it is massive enough, it will overcome the atomic and nuclear forces and force the mass to inhabit less space.   The star continues to condense, as it does so the escape velocity at the surface increases because the mass of the star is staying constant, but its radius is getting smaller and smaller.   If the star is at least five times the mass of our Sun, the escape velocity will eventually be greater than the speed of light and nothing can escape.  The star will then be a black hole.  The value of \"r\" for a black hole formed from a star five times the mass of our Sun would be about 14 km. Supermassive Black Holes Less well understood are supermassive black holes (SBH), but the basic idea is that we aren't waiting for a star to run out of fuel.  We are using the same equation as above, but we increase the mass by taking a massive object and adding more mass to it.  This could be the collision of two massive objects or it could happen through gradual accretion, such as a collapsing cloud. The supermassive black holes at the center of many galaxies are believed to be as massive as 3 billion of our Suns.  The largest SBH found, to date, is believed to be as massive as 17 billion of our Suns. Micro Black Holes The idea of mini black holes was introduced by Stephen Hawking about 40 years ago.  He reasoned that the extremely energetic expansion of the universe immediately after the Big Bang could have squeezed small amounts of matter to incredible densities.  This could happen to any size mass above the Planck mass. VanDevender & VanDevender from Sandia National Laboratories have an interesting paper about them.  I'll put a link at the bottom. Their thought is that for small mass black holes, rather than sucking all the mass in, the mass becomes gravitationally binded, causing the mass to orbit the black hole. They define a black hole as any object smaller than its Schwarzschild radius.  They believe that space may be full of them, and that they may be the home of much of the mysterious dark matter. http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.0265v1... ",

            "answer_text": "There are 7 ways Black Holes form, or at least, we think there are 7 ways. What happens to form a black hole is that enough matter (or something) collapses in on itself so that space-time is bent around it into a sphere of bent space-time. The collapsing material becomes a singularity, a single point with infinite density and all of that matter, and an Event Horizon barrier (that space-time bent into a sphere) that is the point of no return. The size of the EH is determined by the amount of mass in the singularity. Supernova: you need a star that\u2019s at least 8\u201310 times the mass of the Sun. Stars greater than about 20\u201340 solar masses will give you a black hole; stars less than that will give you a neutron star. Neutron star merger or accretion to a black hole: you need either two neutron stars inspiraling or randomly colliding, or a neutron star siphoning mass off of a companion star to cross a threshold (around 2.5\u20133 solar masses) to become a black hole. Direct collapse black hole: you need enough material (gas clouds) in one place to form a star ~25 times the mass of the Sun or more, and the right circumstances to get a black hole directly (with no supernova) as a result. medium.com. Sound waves: So-called primordial black holes would have spawned soon after the big bang, when sound waves radiated throughout the seething hot ball of plasma that filled the universe. Areas where those waves are densest could have collapsed to form them \u2026 But so far there is no firm evidence for their existence. (Sciam.com) Dark Matter (gas) Halo in hyper-energetic early galaxy formation ScienceDaily Gravitational Wave: A kind of freakish gravitational wave would be so powerful it could tangle space-time, form a black hole and destroy Earth. But don\u2019t worry, it probably won\u2019t. NewScientist Aug 2018 Kugelblitz: There is a hypothetical object that is a black hole not formed by matter but from light. We haven\u2019t observed one but it is theoretically possible that if you pack enough light into a small enough space you can form a black hole, but it has a much more (awesome) name: A kugelblitz. Now imagine you are packing tons and tons of light into a box. You could potentially form a black hole. SciShow made the calculation that you would need to \u201ccollect all the light put out over 10 years by all the stars in a 350 light year radius of Earth\u201d concentrated into a volume the size of a mosquito.

            "answer_text": "Black holes do not exist. Here\u2019s why. Black holes are said to be: Stars that have collapsed. There is no reason to believe that because something burns up in any way and collapses that it will *gain* gravity. If anything in burning out and/or collapsing that it would not simply lose mass and therefore gravity. Gravity is always measured from the center out and after collapse there is still the same center. In attracting things into itself it has been said that it rips atoms apart. Atoms produce gravity so that would be a little counter productive if you ask me. If there was such immense gravity to pull stars in from all over the area.., how is it that suns and such know how to plot a long curving path to come into the end of the outside spiral wait their turn to be destroyed\u2026 But of course since Very Rubin discovered in 1974 that the outside spirals of galaxies are turning the same speed as the inner spirals that blew away the idea that there was any whirlpool kind of thing going on anyway. Galaxies turn pretty much as flat disks\u2026 So there is no whirlpool action after all. So now on the other hand, it seems that black holes are actually white holes. They spew electrons, protons, neutrons and other bits just the same as our own sun that we call solar wind. But of course galaxy centers will be doing so on a much more massive scale. The bits then form spirals moving outward much the same as your lawn sprinkler spins spirals of water droplets outward on every revolution. These bit then for the atoms which form the nebula and then sun, and such from there. All continuing to move outward. Now there is dark matter gathered around galaxy centers\u2026 They\u2019re saying it\u2019s to keep the galaxy from flying off into space. lol What happened to all that previous gravity that was so strong as to not let light escape\u2026 Where did all that previous gravity go..? :) It was never there. So if there *is* dark matter it very likely could be the unseen \u2018solar wind\u2019 that is being spun out from all galaxies that is yet to come together as objects able to be seen or measured in any other way than by it\u2019s total gravity\u2026 That\u2019s just a thought. One that may explain it. ?? But that would be even more evidence that galaxy centers are white holes. IMHO ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes are generally formed by supergiant stars, which are more than 10 times massive than Sun.  Assume you are on a planet that is orbiting a supergiant star, which is going to die.  A star gets its shape by balancing the inward pull (Gravitational force- that wants to collapse star into it) and outward pull (the force produced by Nuclear Fusion that tries to expand star more and more). So, the shape of star is the area at which both forces get balanced. When all the hydrogen fuel of star burns out, there rests nothing to propagate Nuclear Fusion further. As a result, Gravitational force win over Nuclear Fusion. There are extreme gravity and pressures in core of star. Just after stopping fusion, gravity starts to pull matter inside core. In a millisecond, core of star shrinks and becomes a fraction of part of its original size and a baby black hole gets form in core. Bad luck, you can't see it. From outside, you can't understand - is there any black hole in centre?  The electromagnetic forces, frictional forces and gravitational force play by such a mysterious way that star explodes in form of supernova leaving a baby black hole behind. Unfortunately, you would surely not survive after that explosion.  Supernovae have a power to destroy millions of worlds and started by two huge jets of energy called Gamma ray bursts. All the energy star gathered in its lifetime is released in a short time, 100 times more energy than sun's whole lifetime energy. Second way, by which a star can be converted into a black hole is 'Unnova'. In that process, a star directly collapsed into a black hole without being explode. So fortunately, you can see that.  You can see how star gets compress into an area of few kilometers from millions of kilometers and everything happened in a millisecond (thousandth part of a second). Like you recorded a video in which water is leaving through hole in bottom of a container, and play the video with fast forward.  Let's replace sun with that star for a while. As sunlight takes 8.3 minutes to reach on earth, you will see everything 8.3 minutes later than it happens. Yet, it's not a good sign to lose a star. There's no chance of surviving life long without a source of energy.  There's also a third method. I am talking about Direct Collapse Theory of cosmology. Scientists put that theory when they were trying to know how the black holes became supermassive (which are at centre of galaxies). Black holes grow by swallowing matter, light and even other black holes. When first black holes were formed, it was not too time they have to grow upto such a size. As 3.80 lakhs of years after Bigbang, first atoms were formed, mostly were of hydrogen because it's the simplest atom having an electron and a proton. After thousands of years, huge clouds of hydrogen gathered there. These clouds collapsed by there own gravity and formed first stars. That edge of universe is called The Dark Age and the stars here are known as dark stars, the largest stars ever. After millions of years, there fuel ran out and they left a black hole behind. What a long process! Scientists know, the remaining time was not so enough to form a supermassive black hole. So they put 'Direct Collapse theory'. According to that theory, some of clouds of hydrogen and dust in dark age were so huge that they shrunk by their own gravity to form black holes directly without forming stars. For more, you can see Jagdish Jangra's answer to What is a black hole? How can we understand it? Was that interesting? You can comment your thoughts on this! ",

White dwarf : stars below 1.4 solar mass loose their outer layer and their core cools down to form white dwarf. Later it changes into yellow dwarf and then to red dwarf. Finally it becomes invisible by forming black dwarf which neither emits electric fields nor heat energy. Neutron star : the core of the star finishes up as Neutron start if the mass is greater than 1.4 but less than 5 solar mass Black hole : if the original mad of the star is greater than 5 solar mass the core does into black hole which is exactly not a hole but a curvature caused due to a high density object (according to Einstein). 2 .WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF BLACK HOLE: (fromSriharsha Koduru (\u0c36\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c40\u0c39\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c37 \u0c15\u0c4b\u0c21\u0c42\u0c30\u0c41)'s answer to Are black holes really wormholes? If so, what's on the other side?) Actually black hole is not a hole. According to Albert Einstein there is 4th dimension called curvature with respect to time. So in space every object creates a curved bowl like structure around itself according to their mass. So an object with greater mass creates larger and longer curve. Blackhole has a really great mass so it creates a large and long curve giving it a shape of a hole. If an object comes into its huge and powerful gravitational field the object certainly damages as it enters the curve but as it comes out it completely vanishes because it gets totally damaged due to the black hole.

            "answer_text": "A Black Hole is the end product of a very massive star once it gets to the end of its life. All stars begin the same by condensing out of a cloud of clod molecular gas and dust. Some of these clouds can be between 15 and 600 light years in diameter. Depending on the initial mass the star was born with will decide its eventual fate The smaller stars up to about 8 solar masses at birth will end up as white dwarf stars of which there are two kinds. Carbon / Oxygen white dwarf, andOxygen / Neon / Magnesium white dwarf.The only real difference between these two dwarf stars is that the Oxygen / Neon / Magnesium dwarf had more mass at birth which means that the star has been able to undergo fusion of Hydrogen, Helium and Carbon whereas the Carbon / Oxygen dwarf star has only been able to complete Hydrogen and Helium fusion. Our sun is one solar mass so will probably end up as an Carbon / Oxygen white dwarf These star remnants do not condense any further due to `electron degeneracy` pressure which halts the continued compression. . The next stage is a Neutron star where the mass of the star is sufficient enough to contract the star to a point where all of the matter pretty much becomes one giant Neutron. Again a Neutron star becomes subject to `Neutron degeneracy` which halts further contraction. How this works is as follows. In stars, the force of gravity is constantly attempting to compress the star while the force of pressure is constantly attempting to balance out this compressing force. For a stable star, these two forces are equal. This is commonly referred to as Hydra-Static equilibrium. By the Fermi Exclusion Principle it is accepted that no two fermions of an atom can occupy the same energy state. This means that no two electrons can be in the same state, unless they have different spins. Also, neutrons in the nucleus cannot be in the same energy level as other neutrons. This means that if a star is under pressure it may be possible that this degenerate electron or neutron pressure will support the star. So, as stars begin to collapse, atoms are compressed and electrons move to lower energy states. However, as electrons fill up energy states, they reach a point that they cannot be compressed any further without two electrons being in the same state. This means that eventually degenerate electron pressure equal the force of gravity and the star becomes stable again. If the star is massive enough, and the force of gravity great enough, electron degenerate pressure can break down. Then, as the atoms are further compressed, degenerate neutron pressure begins to build in an attempt to counteract the force of gravity. If the neutron pressure is great enough to balance out the force of gravity than a Neutron star is created. If however, the degenerate Neutron pressure breaks down under the force of gravity, then a Black Hole is created.  Image of what a typical Neutron star would probably look like ",

            "answer_text": "Laymen often forget that the notions of \u201cblack holes\u201d (though the term was not coined back then; it was coined after Einstein published GR) pre-date Einstein. It just means something that is so gravitationally attractive that the velocity required to exit its field is greater than the speed of light. That is why they are black. You have three basic categories of theoretical or (perhaps) observed black holes: primordial, stellar (i.e., gravitational collapse), and relativistic-collision-based (i.e., kugelblitz). Some black holes may have been created during the Big Bang itself and exist still today. These are theoretical; they are the primordial class, and I\u2019m not sure by which mechanism they would have formed. I separate them out because their origins may be varied, where the other two are consistent in mechanism of origin. A star is an equilibrium state between the crushing force of gravity wanting to pull the whole of the star inward to a point, and the explosive force of nuclear fusion wanting to \u201cexplode\u201d it outward. Many stars, like our Sun, will exist for billions of years (and have already existed for billions of years) in this state of equilibrium. Very large stars live a far shorter lifetime; some only on the order of millions of years (not billions). When they exhaust their fusion fuels (i.e., those that release energy when they are fused, rather than requiring energy for the fusion process to occur), they will experience a state of disequilibrium \u2014 nothing will be pushing outward; gravity will dominate and pull everything inward. This is a cheap way of explaining what is going on; it is thought that the core is all that collapses, not the entire star; for simplicity purposes we\u2019ll just assume it\u2019s the whole star. So with nothing exploding outward, everything is pulled inward. At a point during the collapse, the escape velocity for anything from the collapsing object will reach the speed of light; at that point an event horizon is formed. That region of spacetime now has the characteristics basic to a black hole. It is theoretically possible to collide sufficiently relativistic particles, in an accelerator or something similar, to create an energy density in a small enough region of space to form a black hole (or micro-black hole). But this is not within our technology today. As figured by Susskind, it would take a linear accelerator the size of the diameter (or radius \u2014 I forget \u2014 on that order of magnitude) of our galaxy with a luminosity greater than anything you could imagine (brighter than our galaxy) to accelerate particles to the state they need to be in, by chance, to collide with another and form a micro-black hole. It would likely only last for a Planck time (an unimaginably short amount of time). The length of time a black hole exists is directly proportional to its mass; stellar-mass and supermassive black holes, and primordial black holes, may have the mass needed to allow them persist for any length of time requisite for you to notice them.

            "answer_text": "In order to understand how a Black hole is formed we must understand the Chandrasekhar limit. The Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass for a white dwarf to stay a stable white dwarf stars i.e. can hold up against the force of gravity. If they have a mass less than 1.44 solar masses, then it will stay a white dwarf. Since white dwarfs are stars at the end stage of their life they do not use nuclear fusion in order to counteract the force of gravity, white dwarfs use the degeneracy pressure of electrons.  The Pauli exclusion principle does not allow two identical \u00bd integer spin electrons and all other fermions to exist in the same quantum state. The result is the pressure against the compression of matter in the star. In order to further understand the way that electron degeneracy works we must look at the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that as the uncertainty in position increases the uncertainty in it\u2019s momentum decreases vice versa. A star subjected to increasing pressure will be more compact thus the uncertainty in the position will be less thus as dictated by the Uncertainty principle it\u2019s momentum will. If a star exceeds in this mass it will either become a neutron star or black hole. The Chandrasekhar limit is derived using Albert Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.

            "answer_text": "Depends on what the black hole type is. There are three types: micro, stellar, and supermassive. Micro Black Holes These black holes are only hypothetical, but may have popped into existence during the first moments of the universe when it was denser and smaller. These black holes are called 'primordial black holes'. Humans could theoretically create a micro black hole, but only when the energy produced by a particle accelerator reaches 10^19 GeV (gigaelectronvolts). The most energy a particle accelerator has produced however is 1.4 x 10^13 GeV in the Large Hadron Collider. So all those fears that we could create a black hole that brings the end of the world is false (for now). Stellar Black Holes These black holes form when the star goes supernovae and is more than 5 times the mass of the Sun (the Chandrasekhar Limit). This happens due to the star not able to support its own weight anymore, often after they produced a certain amount of iron. The star then collapses into itself. When a star reaches the Chandrasekhar Limit, it collapses into its Schwarzschild radius, which is how small an object has to be in order to become a black hole. When a star's density is so big that its escape velocity is over the speed of light (299,792.458 kilometers per second), then it becomes a stellar-mass black hole. The Schwarzschild radius can be calculated using this formula:  Where R is the Schwarzschild radius, G is its constant of gravity, M is its mass, and c is the speed of light. Supermassive Black Holes And finally, supermassive black holes. There are a lot of theories out there for how these monster black holes, who lurk in the center of galaxies, can form. Some believe the supermassive black holes form when many black holes merge into one, when the universe was still smaller, primordial or stellar. The formation of supermassive black holes seem to have some relation to quasars, which means the supermassives have to form during the early days of the universe. Others believe that stellar clusters in the center of galaxies might've collapsed inwards in itself when the velocity dispersion holding the stars together to speeds only seen in relativity. But both theories are still not proved yet, so it's  ",

            "answer_text": "To create a black hole you need to squeeze a very large amount of matter into a very small space.This way the gravitational pull becomes so strong that even light gets dragged back.A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying. In the normal life of a star there is a constant tug of war between gravity pulling in and pressure pushing out. Nuclear reactions in the core of the star produce enough energy and pressure to push outward. For most of a star\u2019s life, gravity and pressure balance each other exactly, and so the star is stable. Gravitational collapse occurs when an object's internal pressure is insufficient to resist the object's own gravity.This happens when a star runs out of its nuclear fuel and gravity gets the upper hand and the material in the core gets compressed even further. The more massive the core of the star, the greater the force of gravity that compresses the material, collapsing it under its own weight. When a very massive star(much more massive than the sun) exhausts its nuclear fuel,it expels all its outer layers in a giant explosion called a supernova. The outer parts of the star are expelled violently into space, while the core completely collapses under its own weight.Such an explosion is so powerful and bright that it can outshine the light of billions and billions of stars put together. If the core remaining after the supernova is very massive (more than 2.5 times the mass of the Sun), no known repulsive force inside a star can push back hard enough to prevent gravity from completely collapsing the core into a black hole. From the perspective of the collapsing star, the core compacts into a mathematical point with virtually zero volume, where it is said to have infinite density. This is called a singularity (Gravitational Singularity- a one-dimensional point which contains a huge mass in an infinitely small space, where density and gravity become infinite and space-time curves infinitely. As the eminent American physicist Kip Thorne describes it, it is \"the point where all laws of physics break down\".) Collisions between black holes and other objects will produce a growing black hole that swallows everything that comes too near it.  The black hole named Cygnus X-1 formed when a large star caved in. This black hole pulls matter from the blue star beside it. Credits: NASA/CXC/M.Weiss Our Milky Way galaxy has at its centre a black hole several million times the mass of our sun. ",

            "answer_text": "For about 50 years, scientists have accepted the theory that when a star comes to the end of its life-cycle, it will undergo a gravitational collapse and if there is sufficient mass, the collapse will trigger the formation of a black hole. Yes, stars have a life cycle too. Low-mass stars like the Sun live the longest. The Sun is believed to have formed about 4.50 billion years ago, now known as a main sequence star, and is expected to continue for another 5 billion years or so. I am sure you are aware that stars generate energy by fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium. High mass stars have a shorter lifetime because they use up the nuclear fuel lot faster. Lives and Deaths of Stars When low-mass stars like the Sun exhaust the hydrogen, it begins fusion of helium into carbon, and when the helium is also exhausted it is left with a core of carbon which cannot be fused because the sun is not massive enough. The Sun will then collapse due to it's own gravity, and eventually cool into a white dwarf. (Actually it is a lot more complex but I made it brief.)  Image courtesy of: Evolution of Stars More massive stars continue fusion of carbon, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, and iron. When the core of the star reaches the iron stage, it cannot be fused any more, so the star becomes unstable and ejects it's outer core in a supernova, leaving behind the inner core that is the densest form of observable matter in the universe: a neutron star. Protons and Electrons fuse to form Neutrons. I  Image courtesy of: www.astro.psu.edu If the core of the dying star is under 1.40 solar masses, it turns into a white dwarf. If the core is more than 1.4 solar masses, it goes supernova leaving behind a Neutron star. The maximum limit of a neutron star is 3 solar masses; if it is over 3 solar masses, then it becomes a black hole and disappears. I must add, that quite recently, scientists have discovered black holes that have evolved without going through the \u2018supernova\u2019 stage: https://www.space.com/37001-black-hole-born-from-collapsing-star-video-images.html ",

            "answer_text": "There has been a merger of the two black holes which has been unpredicted and it is related to the origin story as per the MIT researchers. The merger has been found initially on 12th April, 2019. It is a form of the gravitational wave which had been associated with the detectors of the LIGO or Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory along with the Italian named Virgo. The scientists have found the signal and named it as GW190412. They have found that it had sprung from the clash between the two black holes. One of them is three times bigger in comparison to the other. There has been a signal which is the initial detection of a merger between two black holes of very different sizes.  From a research, as per the report of second September, 2020, Physical Review Letters which is a journal, it indicates that there is a lopsided merger which had begun via various process in comparison to majority of the mergers. In other words, it can be binaries, which is going to form. When we compare 2 black holes, on the basis of size, there has been a merger of two black holes, which are the parents. There is a dense pack named \u201cnuclear cluster\u201d prior to merging with second black hole, which is small in size. There are gravitational waves, which are sent across our space. GW190412 is going to be the second generation and it might be known as the \u201chierarchical\u201d merger and they are apart from other mergers of the first-generation and the Virgo and LIGO had been detected. According to Salvatore Vitale who is a professor at MIT in physics, he believes that there we have not seen them coming. But it is a fact that nothing occurs only one time in our universe. It is quite rare and we hope to observe them once more. It is good that we are going to study a lot about this fascinating universe. The coauthors Vitale are University of Birmingham researcher named Davide Gerosa along with John Hopkins University researcher named Emanuele Berti. We have discovered two primary ways of the merger of black hole. The common envelope process is the first one. In this process there are two neighboring stars, which explode after billions of years for forming two black holes, which are neighboring and it has a general envelope. In other words, there is a disk of the gas. After billion of years, there are black holes which are spiral and they are going to merge. According to Vitale, the process has been suspected to occur in the galaxy discs like our Milky Way. The dynamical interactions is a way of merging black hole. There is a galactic rave, where there are black holes which are trapped in a small region of our universe. When the two black holes begin to become partner, there is a third which might knock couple other than the dynamical interaction. It will repeat several times prior to the group of black holes. They merge finally. In a process of common envelope along with the scenario of dynamical interaction, there is merging of black holes which had approximately similar mass, other than the lopsided mass ratio of that GW190412. They might lack no spin, on the other hand, the GW190412 had been high spin. In the two scenarios, people thought that the right nurseries for our black hole binaries in our universe, there is a fight to elucidate a particular mass ratio along with the spin of the particular event.

            "answer_text": "A common type of black hole is produced by certain dying stars. A star with a mass greater than about 20 times the mass of our Sun may produce a black hole at the end of its life. In the normal life of a star there is a constant tug of war between gravity pulling in and pressure pushing out. Nuclear reactions in the core of the star produce enough energy and pressure to push outward. For most of a star\u2019s life, gravity and pressure balance each other exactly, and so the star is stable. However, when a star runs out of nuclear fuel, gravity gets the upper hand and the material in the core is compressed even further. The more massive the core of the star, the greater the force of gravity that compresses the material, collapsing it under its own weight. For small stars, when the nuclear fuel is exhausted and there are no more nuclear reactions to fight gravity, the repulsive forces among electrons within the star eventually create enough pressure to halt further gravitational collapse. The star then cools and dies peacefully. This type of star is called a \"white dwarf.\" When a very massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel it explodes as a supernova. The outer parts of the star are expelled violently into space, while the core completely collapses under its own weight. If the core remaining after the supernova is very massive (more than 2.5 times the mass of the Sun), no known repulsive force inside a star can push back hard enough to prevent gravity from completely collapsing the core into a black hole. From the perspective of the collapsing star, the core compacts into a mathematical point with virtually zero volume, where it is said to have infinite density. This is called a singularity. Where this happens, it would require a velocity greater than the speed of light to escape the object's gravity. Since no object can reach a speed faster than light, no matter or radiation can escape. Anything, including light, that passes within the boundary of the black hole -- called the \"event horizon\" -- is trapped forever. To have even more deeper understanding about Black holes,refer to the largest selling book- http://www.fisica.net/relatividade/stephen_hawking_a_brief_history_of_time.pdf ",

            "answer_text": "In short, nobody knows exactly how a BH forms either Stellar or Super massive type. It is true that they are the end states of collapsing stars. But till date there is no model developed which could explain the BH formation. Back in 1931, Oppenheimer and Synder looked at a system of star which is homogeneous, pressure less and gravity as a dominating force where they observed BH forming in finite time in comvoing frame. But as you see this has many assumptions. There are only theorems which could explain Singularities formation, Penrose singularity theorems but no mathematical proof that horizons form all the time during a collapse of a star. Penrose conjectured Cosmic Censorship, where he proposed that all Singularities so formed during the collapse will be cut off from outside world by an horizon. But this conjecture is not yet proved. The only reason physicists go after BH and its implications is because the metric that describe these BH spacetimes like Schwarszchild BH, Kerr Spacetime are exact solutions of EFE'S. May be in near future we will be able to construct a model which could explain the formation of BH in a comvoing frame. Gravitational collapse is a subject which tries to answer this question. One more cool fact, even if we make a model trying to explain the formation, you mostly can't test it, as an outside observer who is not in falling into BH cannot observe a BH forming due to gravitational effects. Hope I conveyed it properly. ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes form when an object is compressed below what we call a 'schwarzschild radius'. This is basically a critical radius below which, an object has an 'event horizon' from where even light can not exit the gravitational pull. Black holes are naturally formed due to extreme gravitational pull of supermassive stars (having mass greater than 20 times that of our sun). However, there is one more factor which results in this crazy compression of these heavenly bodies, Iron fusion. If you happen to know anything about how stars are lit, it's because of their uncontrolled thermonuclear fusion happening inside them. They manage to keep there shape because these reactions release energy and that helps to counter the intense gravitational pull of their cores .Initially,fuse hydrogen to helium to carbon and so on. But, once the core starts fusing iron (from silicon) that's when things start going south. All the previous fusion reactions released heat, but iron fusion sucks(energy). And thus the star has no choice but to compress as there is nothing to stop the crazy amount of gravitational pull by the core of the star. The star is doomed. Nothing can stop it from collapsing. PS. You don't need to be a star to become a black hole, as I already mentioned, compress something to below it's critical 'schwarzchild radius' and it will become a black hole. It's just that we don't have enough technology that can do such a crazy compression. PPS. Shwarzchild radius for sun is about 2.8km. imagine compressing our sun to 3 km in radius. That sounds impossible, right? Because it is. The sun is not massive enough to become a black hole, so even gravitational force cannot do it. ",

            "answer_text": "Every star follows a life-death cycle. A star is born out of dust and gas (hydrogen) clouds. This space where stars are born is called a Nebula. Then the star reaches the Yellow Dwarf stage and becomes a Main Sequence star. Every 9 out of 10 stars in the known universe is a main sequence star. Our sun is still in this phase. Following up is the Red Giant stage, which is basically a dying star. When the star slowly runs out of hydrogen and helium, it grows almost 100\u20131000 times in size. The star cools down in temperature and where it goes after this depends on the size of the star. This is where gravity takes over. Smaller stars become white dwarf stars which are incredibly dense. They further cool down to become black dwarf stars. On the other hand, stars that are at least 8\u201320 times more massive than our sun explode into violently beautiful celestial fireworks called Supernovae. After the explosion what remains is the core of the star. This can either become a neutron star or a black hole. Neutron stars are incredibly massive in terms of gravity. Matter is so tightly packed that even a teaspoon of things can weigh tonnes! Alternatively, the fusion process in the core continues to move up on the periodic table all the way up to Iron. And that is where it stops. Without the outward radiation of force and energy from the fusion process, the scales tips in favor of gravity, causing the star to collapse under its own weight. Gravity is so dense that all this mass collapses and shrinks to the an infinitely small point, characterized by infinite density. This is what scientists call, a singularity. This is how black holes are formed in space. Studies suggest the presence of a supermassive black hole in every galaxy. The one in out very own Milky Way is called Sagittarius-A. ",

            "answer_text": "No one really knows how black holes are formed! All of the suggested formation processes are completely theoretical with no experimental backing. It is usually assumed that, when a star of sufficient mass (say, more than ten times the mass of the sun) comes to the end of its fuel burning phase, it will go supernova and leave behind a small dense remnant of the original star. There is experimental evidence in support of this. If the remnant has mass more than about one-and-a-half times the mass of the sun, it will collapse until it becomes a neutron star. There is experimental evidence for this. If the neutron star mass is more than about three times the mass of the sun, it will continue to collapse until it becomes a black hole. There is zero experimental evidence for this! On the other hand, what else could happen to a massive neutron star? Well, as always, the devil is in the details! For me there are two issues here: The three times the mass of the sun might be hopelessly wrong. Perhaps a neutron star retains its integrity up to, say, ten times the mass of the sun. Since no neutron star candidates have been found with such a high mass, then neutron star collapse would not be a way to make black holes.Neutrons (and protons) are known to be composed of small point-like particles known as \u201cpartons\u201d. If a neutron star does collapse under the action of gravity, it should eventually become a \u201cparton star\u201d. A parton star is not a singularity. In this case, there are neither theoretical calculations nor experimental data to guide us. A parton star might, or might not, be a black hole.What about super-massive black holes? Curiously, there is experimental evidence that such objects exist. For example, there is a compact object in the core of our galaxy that has several stars in orbit. This allows the mass of the compact object to be determined experimentally. It has several million times the mass of the sun! We truly don\u2019t know what it is, but what else could it be but a large black hole? Unfortunately, we know of no mechanism that can produce such an object. It is usually assumed that millions of small black holes merge to form the large black hole but there are two problems with this scenario: the merging process would take an infinite amount of time and we don\u2019t know of any mechanism to make the small black holes! Finally, something that no theoretician likes to talk about. It is usually assumed that the electron is a point particle. It is usually assumed that the partons inside the neutron and the proton are point particles. Point particles are, by definition, singularities and they have to be black holes! So, the only easy, guaranteed experimentally proven way to make black holes is to make electrons and protons and neutrons in elementary particle collisions! ",

            "answer_text": "What causes a black hole? Gravity. And LOTS of fluffy azure rabbits at the same place. It does not mater what matter you have. You can take azure rabits, microwave owens, Boeings 747s, oceans\u2026 Whatever you like. Take enough of it to close proximity and you will get a black hole. Eventually. There is a process that can delay it. It is called nuclear fusion. If you have materials willing to fuse, then they radiate energy in the process. This radiated energy will balance the gravity pressure. Such an object we call a star. It does not work forever, though. Heavier and heavier elements are created by this fusion (see elemental table). But at some point, fusion won\u2019t get you any more radiation. Won\u2019t release any more energy. Instead it will consume the energy. This point is called iron. And it is a doom for all stars. Heavier elements produce radiation (release energy) only by fission, not fusion. That is why in our nuclear power plants we don\u2019t use hyrogen but uranium. So at one point, a star dies and gravity will do what gravity does. There are only two processes to avoid creation of black hole now. Both are based on we don\u2019t have enough matter around. You know magnets. Same charges repel each other. Electrons does the same. They refuse to be sqeezed. And this \u201crefusal force\u201d can hold the gravity forever. Such an object we call a white dwarf. Sun will become one when it dies.If there is too much mass, electrons won\u2019t get a chance. They will be pushed into the atoms nucleai and fuse with protons, creating another neutrons. At this point, matter is consisting only of neutrons. They, like electrons, repel each other. With greater force than electrons. So they create another stable configuration to defend agains gravity. Such an object we call a neutron star. Massive stars create those, when they die.This works until the mass of such object reach more than 1,4 times the mass of the Sun. After that, even neutrons are not strong enough and object will colapse with no other mechanic known to stop it. A black hole is born. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh boy, this is going to be a big answer. So here\u2019s the short version: Stars generate energy by fusing hydrogen atoms into heliumThis process is known as nuclear fusion, nuclear fusion releases energyThis energy resists the star\u2019s own gravitational pullWhen the nuclear fusion stops, there is no force to resist gravityStar\u2019s gravitational force compresses the star and it gets smaller and smaller in sizeIf the star is above a certain mass, it collapses into a black holeHere's the long version\u2026 When massive stars die, they turn into black holes. The star has to be massive, else it will not turn into a black hole. Why is that? Let\u2019s first understand the inner workings of any star. A star consists of Hydrogen atoms which fuse together to form Helium atoms giving out energy in the process and also increasing the mass of the star (as helium is heavier than hydrogen). That\u2019s nuclear fusion. Stars are not burning fire, they are creating heat energy by fusion. That\u2019s why, putting out Sun with a billion or more gallons of water won\u2019t work. Imagine that you have a small, but unbreakable balloon in your hands. You try to squeeze the balloon but, due to the air inside it, you are unable to do it. The air inside it stops you from squeezing it. Something similar happens inside a star, except, it\u2019s not air which is resisting the force of gravity, it\u2019s the radiation due to nuclear fusion reactions. Stars are big nuclear fusion reactors. They continuously convert Hydrogen to Helium inside them. Everything is fine till the time there is enough Hydrogen to convert to Helium. But, as I said before, stars are massive and that means they also have very strong gravity, and gravity being gravity, tries to pull everything towards itself. When the star has nuclear fusion reactions going on inside it, the energy from these reactions keeps pushing against the gravity of the star. (Just like the air in balloon stops you.) Outward force (Energy from radiation) = Inward force (Force of gravity) = All good  The fun starts when a star has used up all the hydrogen and converted it to helium. Going back to our balloon example, what would happen if there is no air inside it? You would be able to squeeze it, won\u2019t you? That\u2019s what happens in a star. No hydrogen = No nuclear fusion = No energy The star starts to get smaller and smaller and becomes a bla - WAIT! What about all the Helium inside it? Can\u2019t it convert to something else and give out energy? And that\u2019s exactly what happens. When the star reduces in size, the energy inside it increases and Helium starts to combine and form Lithium. Note: This cannot happen immediately after Hydrogen is over as Helium to Lithium requires more energy for fusion Due to the new energy from fusion reactions of Helium, the star starts to expand again. After a few more billion years, Helium is over. The star contracts, then expands because some other heavier element is formed in it. Then that\u2019s over and this happens over and over again. Until\u2026Iron starts forming\u2026 Iron absorbs the energy generated by nuclear fusion. So, instead of resisting gravity, all the energy is absorbed and the star starts contracting. With no force to resist gravity, it keeps on shrinking in size while at the same time the mass increases due to fusion reactions which are creating iron in its core. If the star is not massive enough, it will stop shrinking when the electrons (particles with negative charge) in the atoms repel (Two same charges repel) each other and this force resists the force of gravity. This results in dwarf stars. Sometimes, the star is so massive that even the electrons cannot stop the shrinking. In this case, electrons combine with the protons (particles with positive charge) in the atom and form neutrons (particles with no charge). This results in a neutron star. The density of this star is extremely high. But\u2026 If a star is extremely massive, even the neutrons cannot stop it from collapsing and the entire star, which was once so massive, is now only a point in space.  And that point with huge mass is your black hole. Tada! ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes are formed from the cores of stars, really massive stars. A black hole is a point of singularity which is infinitely dense, and has a gravitational field so strong, that not even light can escape its pull. Although, black holes are not actually \u201cblack\u201d, they radiate Hawking radiation which we\u2019ve recently found out. There are two ways a star can die, a type I supernova and type II supernova. Type I is a weird phenomenon that involves stellar accretion and is irrelevant to the context as black holes are not formed from type I. Instead, I\u2019ll be talking about Type II. A type II supernova occurs when a star whose mass is above 1 solar mass, reaches the end of its lifetime and undergoes nuclear collapse. Type II again can be of three forms - stars in the range of 1\u20138 solar masses exploding from which the core of the stars remain as white dwarfs, stars in the range 8\u201325 solar masses exploding from which the cores of the stars emerging as neutron stars, and stars above 25 solar masses exploding, from which the cores remain as black holes. Stars above 25 solar masses are huge and hot, and more often than not belong to one of the A-B-0 spectral classes. When these stars reach the end of their lifetime and have synthesized iron in their cores, they undergo nuclear collapse. The outer material of the star implodes inwards due to the immense force of gravity but the electron degeneracy pressure acting from the core towards the outside tries to balance it. If the electron degenracy pressure can\u2019t balance the immense gravity, the star keeps imploding until a point of infinite density is created in the core. This is the birth of a black hole. The core that\u2019s now turning into a black hole ejects the material around it in a dramatic explosion that becomes the type II supernova of that star. After few moments, the core has completely turned into a black hole and now starts sucking in and accreting matter. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, to that question, there are multiple theories. The most commonly accepted of which goes a little like this. When a star reaches the end of its life (Colossal stars, roughly 3 or more times larger then our very own sun), and is on the verge of supernova, as all of its energy and nuclear fuel is spent, it stops producing heat and can therefore no longer produce the energy necessary to feed the star, thereby preventing the star from having the balance needed to support the stars own gravitational draw against the incredible intense pressures brewing on the inside. Due to that, its stability crack under the force of its own gravity.  The stars radius shrinks significantly, to a critical size, to what is referred to as 'The Schwarzchild Radius'   (The term was named after the mathematician Karl Schwarzschild, who first developed the formula: Rs = 2 GM/c2. M is the mass of the body, G is the universal constant of gravitation, and c is the speed of light. You can use this formula to calculate the Schwarzschild radius of any object.) In this state, the star begins to devour anything and everything that dares come near, including light and electromagnetism. Gravity takes its course, and the star caves in, imploding. The outer layers of the star explode into space, possibly even falling into the already dense black hole that has formed, which is how you get what is call a Stellar Mass Black Hole (There are supermassive and stellar black holes, supermassive are millions upon millions of times the mass of our sun, whereas stellar are a couple of times the mass, the largest known one being 15.7 times the mass of our sun), now, exploring the various reactions of what happens to a star... Basically what happens is that nuclear fusion reactions take place in the core of the star which causes an acute outward pressure but that pressure is optimally balanced by the intense inward pull of gravity by the star\u2019s mass. But when a star is in its death throes, the fusion reactions combining hydrogen into helium (like in the Sun) stop and a new kind of nuclear reaction take place that convert helium into carbon.This is followed by carbon turning into oxygen and oxygen to silicon and then to iron.That\u2019s the point where nuclear fusion stops and the outer layers of all the elements produced (hydrogen, helium, carbon & silicon) keep burning around the central core of iron.The mammoth iron core builds up and finally explodes which is called a supernova explosion.After that, there are a couple of outcomes that may take place. 1. A star with a mass 1.4 times more than that of our sun will, after a supernova explosion, simply compress further into a mass of very dense neutrons (So dense that 100 million tons of them would be equal to just one teaspoon!) and become a massive neutron star held up by neutron degeneracy.2. But if the neutrons degenerating are not able to prevent the star\u2019s collapse due to the gravitational forces lurking inside, its shrinks and compresses into an infinite void of blackness or in other words \u2013 a stellar mass black hole.Now supermassive black holes are a category all on their own. They are present in the centers of the majority of galaxies, including our own Milky Way. If you were to take billions of suns and put them together, you would know the mass of a supermassive black hole. The supermassive title making sense? :P There are not really many astronomers who are too sure about how black holes of this magnitude are formed, the physicist Stephen Hawking has a theory that when the Big Bang took place, trillions of little black holes, primordial black holes, were formed along with the universe, but it's just a theory at this point.I get most of my knowledge of astrophysics from the Stephen Hawking book 'A Brief History of Time', various Astronomy books, Science channel, and a couple of random articles on the web. I hope to have my own hilltop backyard with a nice telescope in the future :)Hope I've been of assistance ! If you still have a thirst for more black hole knowledge, there are podcasts all over the internet that should suffice. A good example of one is... http://www.astronomycast.com/astronomy/episode-18-black-holes-big-and-small/For the sake of the race, keep questioning the Universe =) ",

            "answer_text": "Black Hole is one of the most unexplored things presently. Thus, one must know that most of the information regarding Black Holes is through theories and a very few observations. What is it really meant by Black Hole? Black Hole is named so because one cannot observe (see) the part of universe where it is present. This means that there is complete darkness where Black Hole is present. Another thing that the name suggests is that it is a kind of hole in the middle of space that absorbs everything that passes from near it, including light. What leads to origination/formation of a Black Hole? Basically in technical language Black Holes are formed after the death of big Stars. Now let us understand what does this mean. The most abundant element in the universe is Hydrogen (though on Earth it is negligible). When lots of Hydrogen particles come together due to Gravitational pull they start colliding with each other. This results in Nuclear Fusion where two Hydrogen atoms combine to form a Helium nucleus. Helium being an inert gas is much more stable than Hydrogen. During this Nuclear Fusion reactions a lot of energy is released and this is the energy that a star emits. This is how a star is formed. Now after the star is formed, there are continuous Nuclear Fusion reactions teaching place and this goes on for Millions of years. At one point of time all the available Hydrogen for Nuclear Fusion reactions gets over. This means that the star runs out of fuel and at this stage the star dies. A star dieing doesn't mean that the star suddenly disappears. All the mass of the start is still present there. Now all these stable molecules keep collapsing inwards due to gravitational pull and thus the density of the dead star keeps increasing. This high density object in space is referred to as a Black Hole. Now that there are no more Nuclear Reactions going on the Black Hole no more emits radiations. What does a Black Hole really do? Black Holes are really high density, high mass bodies and so the force of gravity that it exerts on other bodies is immense. Due to this Black Holes keep attracting near by bodies and the mass of Black Holes keeps increasing. Therefore, as time passes by the mass increases to such an extent that light curves around the edges of the Black Hole as light is a particle and experiences gravitational pull. This phenomenon is known as Gravitational Lensing. Thus, Black Holes keep absorbing matter around it and in some time intervals some of the matter is released in the form of Jets perpendicular to the plane of Black Holes. How are Black Holes spotted? For spotting a Black Hole Astronomers try to spot the Jets that come out of a very dark part of space. Very dark part of space can be identified by scanning the space for different types of radiations. ",

            "answer_text": "A common black hole is formed when a star of mass about 20 times of our sun completes its life span and dies. In the normal life of a star there is always a struggle between gravity pulling in and pressure pushing out. Nuclear reactions in the core of the star produce enough energy and pressure to push outward. For most of a star\u2019s life, gravity and pressure balance each other exactly, and so the star remains stable. But as the time goes, the nuclear fuels starts running out and gravity takes the lead. Massive the core of star is, greater will the force of gravitation that compresses the material, collapsing the star under its own weight. For small stars, when the nuclear fuel is exhausted and there are no more nuclear reactions to fight gravity, the repulsive forces among electrons within the star eventually create enough pressure to halt further gravitational collapse. The star then cools and dies peacefully. This type of star is called a \"white dwarf.\" When a very massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel it explodes as a supernova. The outer parts of the star are expelled violently into space, while the core completely collapses under its own weight. If the core remaining after the supernova is very massive (more than 2.5 times the mass of the Sun), no known repulsive force inside a star can push back hard enough to prevent gravity from completely collapsing the core into a black hole.

            "answer_text": "The short answer:Were one ever to form, it would be a result of there being sufficient concentration of matter for gravity to overcome nuclear forces. However, a black hole is defined in terms of having an event horizon. As no event horizon ever forms I should say that the proper answer is that black holes are not formed.However, the collapse \u201csoon\u201d becomes sufficiently complete that you can consider the object as a black hole for all purposes that are relevant to the outside universe. The longer answer:Black holes start to form when enough mass is concentrated in a small enough region of space that nuclear forces and energy are insufficient to counter the gravitational field. Once such a collapse starts there is nothing left to stop it, at least in the medium term. However, although the collapse does not stop, the speed of collapse as seen by an observer further from the centre of the black hole will slow down due to gracitationally-induced time dilation. It will in fact slow down to the point that the burgeoning event horizon never quite forms*, although (even after a relatively short time) it is virtually impossible to tell the difference. As I see it, a black hole is defined by having an event horizon; so (pedantically at least) no black hole can ever form. *Ignoring Hawking radiation, the appearance of the event horizons is the limit at infinite time to any external observer. At this limit a Schwarzschild black hole would consist of a near-continuum of concentric event horizons - were it not for Hawking radiation and similar. Thanks for the A2A ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest answer is: By squeezing a piece of matter very, very, very, hard. A black hole is formed when the density of an object with mass \u2014 any object with mass - is compressed so far that it ruptures the fabric of spacetime and contracts into a singularity. The most common way for a black hole to form is probably by the collapse of a very massive star after it uses up all its nuclear fuel. What happens is that the enormous mass of the sun is held up by the nuclear reactions within its core. When the nuclear fuel is exhausted, what is left is a very large mass of primarily iron, which is then, without anything to hold it up, compressed by gravity into a black hole. Contrary to popular opinion, a black hole does not need to be very massive. IF you squeezed the Earth - compressing it down about to the size of an orange, squeezing all that mass down so hard that all the mass of the earth was in that orange-sized object, it would continue to shrink to a singularity with an orange-sized event horizon. The event horizon of a black hole is the distance from the black hole at which its gravitational attraction becomes so large that nothing \u2014 not even light - can escape it. ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes are the most exotic and awe inspiring objects in the Universe. Take the mass of an entire star. Compress it down into an object so compact that the force of gravity defies comprehension. Nothing, not even light, can escape the pull of gravity from a black hole. The idea was first conceived in the 18th century by the geologist John Mitchell. He realized that if you could compress the Sun down by several orders of magnitude, it would have gravity so strong that you\u2019d need to be going faster than the speed of light to escape it. Initially, black holes were considered nothing more than abstract mathematical concepts; even Einsten assumed they didn\u2019t actually exist. But in 1931, the astronomer Chandrasekhar calculated that certain high mass stars might be able to collapse into black holes after all. They turned out to be real, and over the next few decades, astronomers found many examples out in the Universe. Stars are held in perfect balance by two opposing forces. There\u2019s the inward pressure of gravity, attempting to collapse the star, counteracted by the outward pressure of the emitted radiation. At the core, millions of tonnes of hydrogen are being converted into helium every second, releasing gamma radiation. This fusion process is an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases more energy than it requires. As the star consumes the last of its hydrogen, it switches to the stockpiles of helium that it has built up. After it runs out of helium, it switches to carbon, and then oxygen. Since the star continues to pump out radiation, it balances out the gravitational forces trying to compress it. ",

A star with a mass greater than about 20 times the mass of our Sun(20 Solar Mass) may produce a black hole at the end of its life. A star\u2019s life follows following trend: In the normal life of a star there is a constant tug of war between gravity pulling in and pressure pushing out. Nuclear reactions in the core of the star produce enough energy and pressure to push outward. For most of a star\u2019s life, gravity and pressure balance each other exactly, and so the star is stable.However, when a star runs out of nuclear fuel, gravity gets the upper hand and the material in the core is compressed even further.

Not massive enough to continue the fusion reaction, beyond oxygen, they become a white dwarf and cool down.But for stars with about 20 times the mass of our Sun, the fusion process continues further up the periodic table to silicon, aluminum, potassium, and so on, all the way to iron. No energy can be produced by fusing iron atoms together. It\u2019s the stellar equivalent of ash.And so, in a fraction of a second, the radiation from the star turns off. Without that outward pressure from the radiation, gravity wins out and the star implodes. An entire star\u2019s mass collapses down into a smaller and smaller volume of space.From the perspective of the collapsing star, the core compacts into a mathematical point with virtually zero volume, where it is said to have infinite density. This is called a singularity.And this is how you form a black hole. Well, that\u2019s the main way. You can also get black holes when dense objects, like neutron stars, collide with one another. ",

Then if the store is heavy enough or if it collects more mass from outside itself, then it collapses further into very small point Called a singularity, where the density of the matter is almost infinite. There is an imaginary sphere surrounding the singularity And the surface of that sphere is called the \u201cevent horizon\u201d. The gravity created by the singularity of mass at the center of the black hole is so strong that at a distance equal to the radius of the \u201cevent horizon\u201d, nothing can escape, not even light.

Because at the event horizon or slightly beyond it, some electromagnetic energy is given off from the accelerated charged particles being sucked into the black hole.

            "answer_text": "\u00a9 In my humble opinion a Black Hole is comprised of \u201cDark Matter\u201d just as a star is comprised of hydrogen. Dark Matter also swirled into clumps even before matter started clumping together. Dark Matter within the Black hole increases its gravitational pull according to the amount of Dark Matter within the Black Hole. One \u201csuper atom\u201d of Dark Matter combined with another \u201csuper atom\u201d of Dark Matter actually increases the gravity of the two atoms by up to a factor of 6. The more Dark Matter \u201csuper atoms\u201d the higher the increase in gravity until the gravity begins to increase exponentially. Thus, the super massive Black Holes have many millions of Dark Matter \u201csuper atoms.\u201d Matter cannot go into the Black Hole due to the unusual characteristics of Dark Matter. The huge magnetic field of the Black Hole blocks matter from falling into the Black Hole. The matter builds up on the surface of the magnetic layer and continues to be crushed down towards the magnetic field. It builds up in layers like icing on a cake. At some critical point, the magnetic fields of the Black Hole reverse and the matter flows towards the poles from the equator region and hits the highly concentrated magnetic fields coming out of the Black Hole and sparks the matter to ignite into Quasar jets at the north and south poles of the Black Hole, shooting out the matter far into the Universe to form new stars and galaxies. Once the matter buildup is diminished sufficiently, the jets turn off, the poles reverse and matter starts to build up again, until the next time. The Dark Matter that did not clump together into a Black Hole came together to form filaments and the backbone structures within the Universe that hold galaxies together allowing the galaxies to spin faster than normally possible due to the gravitational pull from Dark Matter which is 5/6th the mass of the Universe or about 6 times the mass of hydrogen matter.

            "answer_text": "In short : Black holes are remains  of Dying Massive stars , stars greater than 5-10 times the mass of our son.  Stars are held in perfect balance by two opposing forces. There's an  inward pressure of gravity, attempting to collapse the star,  counteracted by the outward pressure of the emitted radiation and thermonuclear forces. At the core, millions of tonnes of hydrogen are being converted into  helium every second, releasing gamma radiation. This fusion process is  an exothermic reaction, meaning it releases more energy than it  requires. As the star consumes the last of its hydrogen, it switches to the  stockpiles of helium that it has built up. After it runs out of helium,  it switches to carbon, and then oxygen.  Since the star continues to pump out radiation, it balances out the gravitational forces trying to compress it. Stars with the mass of our Sun pretty much stop there. Not massive  enough to continue the fusion reaction, beyond oxygen, they become a  white dwarf and cool down.But for stars with about 5 times the mass of our Sun, the fusion  process continues further up the periodic table to silicon, aluminum,  potassium, and so on, all the way to iron. No  energy can be produced by fusing iron atoms together. It\u2019s the stellar equivalent of ash.    And so, in a fraction of a second, the radiation from the star turns  off. Without that outward pressure from the radiation, gravity wins out  and the star implodes. An entire star\u2019s mass collapses down into a  smaller and smaller volume of space. This is called Supernova. It is most energetic phenomena in the universe where in a fraction of a second so much energy is released which our sun will release in its entire lifetime.  Now depending upon the mass of the star the star will either collapse to a neutron star or white dwarf (2-3 solar masses) or will form a black hole (minimum observed black hole has a mass of 5 solar masses).   Our sun will not form a black hole at the end of its life. ",

            "answer_text": "As far as the first question goes, you can check out a detail summary of all the theories of formation of a black hole on my post here, My look on the theories of the universe  As far as the second question,  Astronomers have found convincing evidence for a supermassive black hole in the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, the galaxy NGC 4258, the giant elliptical galaxy M87, and several others. Scientists verified the existence of the black holes by studying the speed of the clouds of gas orbiting those regions. In 1994, Hubble Space Telescope data measured the mass of an unseen object at the center of M87. Based on the motion of the material whirling about the center, the object is estimated to be about 3 billion times the mass of our Sun and appears to be concentrated into a space smaller than our solar system. For many years, X-ray emissions from the double-star system Cygnus X-1 convinced many astronomers that the system contains a black hole. With more precise measurements available recently, the evidence for a black hole in Cygnus X-1 -- and about a dozen other systems -- is very strong. For mathematical works on this, just try to reach through the countless works on Albert Einstein's interpretation of relativity theory. One of them will give you what you want.  ",

            "answer_text": "By the death of a very massive star. Toward the end of its life such a star will undergo one or another types of catastrophic nuclear reactions. The most common (though not the only one) is what is called an iron-core collapse. Lower mass stars like the Sun can only turn hydrogen into helium, and late in their life, helium into carbon. They can never get hot enough to do anything more. But massive stars can keep adding helium nuclei to heavier and heavier nuclei by using their large gravity to compress the gas in their cores to higher and higher temperatures, until they start to build up iron in their cores as the end-product of lower-mass atoms\u2019 nuclear reactions. However, iron cannot be burned even by the most massive stars, because turning iron into anything else, instead of producing energy, produces less energy than is used up by burning it. So once an iron core starts forming it just keeps growing and growing. However, once it reaches a certain mass (which depends in part on the mass of the overall star, since that effects the force compressing the core), the core starts to collapse under the weight of the rest of the star, and in the process all the electrons in the iron atoms combine with the protons and turn the core into a sea of nothing but neutrons. This has two effects: (1) An extremely large number of neutrinos are produced by the conversion of protons to neutrons, and (2) between its own gravity and the weight of the star above its core, the iron core soon reaches a point where it is so dense that it temporarily becomes not only nearly incompressible but also opaque to neutrinos, so that the huge number of neutrinos being produced are stopped by the iron, pushing it outward and helping it maintain its size for a few instants. This doesn\u2019t last for very long, but in that time, the material falling inward and trying to compress the iron core is suddenly met by an impenetrable \u201cbrick wall\u201d and stops falling inward. But that doesn\u2019t stop the material above it from continuing to fall inward, and as a result the gas just outside the iron core is suddenly compressed and heated to trillions of degrees, and every conceivable nuclear reaction that can occur in any kind of material occurs, in almost literally an instant (at a rate which adds about a hundred or two zeros to the rate of nuclear reactions in the region surrounding the core). The immense energy produced by the sudden pause in the iron core collapse and the sudden stop of the infall of the surrounding material and its subsequent nuclear combustion does two things: (1) It blows the star apart, sending a powerful shock wave outward that within a few hours obliterates the star by spreading its material far and wide into interstellar space, and in the process liberating all the light that had been trapped inside the star prior to that, which is typically several hundred thousand times as much light as the star was allowing to slowly leak out of its surface, and since such stars tend to be a million times brighter than the Sun, means that temporarily, the star can be hundreds or billions of times brighter than the Sun, and even brighter than all the rest of the stars in its galaxy put together (we call this a supernova), and (2) it exerts tremendous pressure on the iron core, and compresses it to such a small size that it is smaller than the Schwarschild Radius for an object with the iron core\u2019s mass \u2014 that is, turning it into a black hole. A substantial portion of the material above the iron core may also fall into the black hole, and in fact it has been recently theorized that some extremely massive stars may generate so large a compressional force on the iron core that instead of blowing itself to pieces the whole star may just collapse into the black hole, along with the core (this is based on the idea that supernovae don\u2019t seem to occur as often as we might expect, given the number of very massive stars in a galaxy \u2014 but whether that theory is in any way correct is very uncertain, so all we can be certain of is that at least some of the material outside the iron core may join it in the black hole). As noted above, this is only one way in which black holes can be created, but one type of supernova or another is thought to be the most common way for stellar-mass black holes to form. Collisions between two stars \u2014 particularly neutron stars \u2014 are also thought to form some black holes, and supermassive black holes form in a completely different way. Still, the above is probably the single most common way in which stellar-mass black holes are created. ",

            "answer_text": "How do they form you can easily see in wiki. It is a process of matter transformation (compression) at giant gravitational field of a parental star (usually 2 to 4.5 masses of the Sun and much more). However, more interesting for us is a question: what happen with the star's matter after the neutron star phase? At this moment nobody knows WHAT. Astrophysicists offer various MODELS of the process but all they are merely the assumptions of scientists... As to the moment of a black hole's formation, we could tell that all we really know about these celestial bodies at all, we know from their traces: powerful X-ray radiation, superintensive gravitational fields that have their strong impact upon circling in neighbourhood stars, red-hot accretion disks of cosmic dust and gas clouds orbiting the black holes,  \u200b and the absence of visible light's radiation from the area a black hole is situated at. Sometimes we can observe a tragic picture of black hole's devouring neighbouring stars...\u200b\ufffc\u200b  \u200b Thus some cases of black holes forming may happen via supernova explosion finished with the forming of a new black hole. We can detect the fact at the intensive X-ray radiation from the centre of the former superstar and at the full absence of any visible light radiated from the area.Another case may happen via forming a more massive black hole out of two lesser (in terms of mass) black holes circled around a common centre of gravity. At this case we can observe superintensive fluctuations of gravitational field that doesn't have grave consequences for us because of too big a distance from those heaven bodies... However the most massive black holes are formed at the centres of galaxies where monstrous gravitation may make one supermassive or a system of less massive black holes from quickly compressing cosmic gas, dust and small stars, which form a compact aggregation often devouring by the forming supermassive black hole.  \u200b Again we can tell nothing about WHAT happen inside the black hole because its existence is known via some anomalies in \"behaviour\" of neighbouring stars' orbits. Say a presence of supermassive black hole (around 6.5 x 1,000,000,000 solar masses) in the centre of our Galaxy we could detect through deviation of a group of stars from their calculated orbits. Thus we cannot learn what happen WITHIN the forming black hole, but we can detect this moment at many phenomena taking place OUTSIDE the forming black hole. And these phenomena happened at definite conditions and in a certain succession may be considered as a proof of the \u201cformation of a black hole\". ",

            "answer_text": "How Does a Black Hole Form?  Supermassive black holes blast winds outward in a spherical shape, as depicted here in this artist's conception of a black hole. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech) There's something inherently fascinating about black holes. Maybe it's that they're invisible beasts lurking in space that sometimes rip passing stars in half and scatter their remains. Whatever it is, these strange cosmic objects continue to captivate scientists and laypeople alike. But where do black holes come from? How do they form, and what gives them such awesome destructive power? [Stephen Hawking's Most Far-Out Ideas About Black Holes] Before we can answer that, we have to ask an even more fundamental question: Just what is a black hole? \"Basically, it's an object or a point in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing can escape from it,\" astrophysicist Neta Bahcall, of Princeton University in New Jersey, told Live Science. Even light waves are sucked in, which is why black holes are black. These bizarre objects arise like phoenixes springing from the ashes of dead stars. When massive stars reach the ends of their lives, the hydrogen that they've been fusing into helium is nearly depleted. So, these monster stars begin burning helium, fusing the remaining atoms into even heavier elements, up until iron, whose fusion no longer provides enough energy to prop up the star's outer layers, according to Swinburne University of Technology in Australia's Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing. These top layers collapse inward and then explode out as a powerful and bright burst called a supernova. Yet, a small part of the star remains behind. Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity predict that if this remnant has about three times the mass of Earth's sun, the remnant star's powerful gravitational force will overwhelm everything else and the material it's made of will be crushed to an infinitely small point with infinite density, according to NASA. The known laws of physics can't actually handle such mind-bending infinities. \"At some point, they break down and we don't really know what happens,\" Bahcall said. [8 Ways You Can See Einstein's Theory of Relativity in Real Life] If this stellar vestige is alone, a black hole will generally just sit there not doing much. But if gas and dust surround the object, that material will get sucked into the black hole's maw, creating bright bursts of light as the gas and dust heat up, swirling around like water going down a drain. The black hole will incorporate this mass into its own, allowing the object to grow, Bahcall said. If two black holes meet, the powerful gravity of each one will attract the other, and they will get closer and closer, spinning around one another. Their collective mass will shake the fabric of nearby space-time, sending out gravitational waves. In 2015, astronomers discovered such gravitational waves via the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), Live Science previously reported. \"That was the first time we could actually see black holes and confirm that they exist,\" Bahcall said, adding that the results were also a beautiful corroboration of Einstein's predictive equations. Scientists had found indirect evidence of black holes before, witnessing stars in the center of our Milky Way galaxy orbiting around a gigantic invisible object, Universe Today reported. How such supermassive black holes \u2014 which can have billions of times the mass of our sun \u2014 form is an outstanding question, Bahcall said. Researchers believe that these supermassive black holes were once much smaller, forming as more modest-size black holes in the earliest days of our universe. Over cosmological time, these objects absorbed gas and dust and merged with one another to grow, ending up as colossal monsters. But many of this story's details remain fuzzy, Bahcall said. Astronomers have observed objects called quasars, which glow brighter than thousands of galaxies put together and are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes consuming matter. Quasars have been seen back as far as the first billion years after the Big Bang, when our universe formed, leaving scientists to scratch their heads over how such enormous objects could form so quickly, Bahcall said. \"That really highlights and adds complexity to the question,\" Bahcall said, and it remains a very active topic of research.

            "answer_text": "From my limited knowledge blackholes are formed when stars run out of fuel and implode under its own gravity then explode in a supernova shedding some of its mass into space. It usually leaves behind a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a blackhole. Which one depends on the mass left behind. Mass gives rise to gravity which has an escape velocity associated with it. A blackhole is defined by its event horizon which is defined as the smallest radius that gives an escape velocity equal to the speed of light. The formula for escape velocity (Ve) is: Ve=2GMrwhere G is Newton\u2019s gravitational constant; M is the mass of the body you\u2019re trying to escape from; and r is your distance from the centre of that body i.e. the radius. Mainstream science claims that a blackhole is one where it collapses on itself that it disappears in a singularity which is a point of zero volume. To me, that\u2019s a physical impossibility because mass is quantised hence, it has a finite volume which can\u2019t fit into zero volume. But then, Mainstream science used to claim that a blackhole destroys entropy until Beckenstein knocked some sense into them. We need another favour against the alleged singularity. ",

            "answer_text": "As per SR/GR, a black hole is formed when a massive star collapses at the end of its life. When a massive stars run out of its fuel, it collapses under its own gravity into the black hole. Some of its mass is thrown out into surrounding space. Remaining mass goes into the black hole. It is very dense as its size is extremely small. There are also black holes at center of galaxies. In my opinion, the black hole is a point in space where gravity is extreme i.e. center of galaxies. Actually, it is not the black hole, It is great, great barycenter point of all stars in the galaxy. Gravity at this location is extreme, not infinite. There is no mass located at this point. Massive stars can collapse into white dwarf or neutron stars. The Sun and Jupiter both revolve around their barycenter point which is outside of the Sun. This point acts as an anchor. Gravitational forces of the Sun and Jupiter are balanced at this point. But there is no mass located. ",

Now, the heat and light obtained by burning of the fuel is radiated outwards into the space. The gravity is pulling the star inwards thus balancing the forces. If the energy liberated from the burning up of the fuel overcomes the gravitational force, the star will expand eventually entering the red giant phase and will bow up to form stellar nebulae. If the gravitational force over comes the heat fuel energy, the star will start to crush because of its gravity and will shrink to form a white dwarf or neutron star. The density of a white dwarf is very high as compared to its original self which is pretty obvious. A tablespoon of white dwarf weighs equal to the weight of all of the humanity on earth. If the weight of the white dwarf becomes more than the Chandrasekhar Limit ( 2.87 x 10^ 30 kg) the white dwarf becomes a black hole. ",

            "answer_text": "A normal star is stable because the radiation pressure generated from its fusion reaction exactly cancels the gravitational force which wants to collapse the star.  When the star runs out of fuel, however, this balance is lost and its core begins to shrink.  Now a couple of things might happen. If the star is about the mass of our sun, its end state will be a white dwarf.  There's no more fusion, only the heavier elements remain, like oxygen, carbon, etc, cooling slowly.  But it does not collapse further because of electron degeneracy pressure, caused by the fact that electrons in the atoms that remain are fermions and cannot occupy the same state.  So if you push these atoms together, their electrons will climb to higher and higher energy states.  This pressure can exactly balance the gravitational force for stars with masses less than around 1.4 solar masses, or the Chandrasekhar limit. But if the star is more massive, it will continue to collapse beyond this state.  It will fuse ever heavier elements.  Its protons may capture its electrons producing neutrons and in the process emitting a great deal of neutrinos in a supernova.  Now the star is denser and composed almost entirely of neutrons.  This time held up by the neutron degeneracy pressure, which is enough as long as the mass of the star is under 2-3 solar masses, or the Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit in this case. OK.  Finally, say the star is even more massive.  10 times more massive than the sun.  It will get to the white dwarf stage and keep collapsing.  It will become a neutron star and still it shrinks.  There's nothing more to hold it up, so its density grows and grows, and eventually, it collapses to the point where all the mass of the star is contained within its Schwarzschild radius, and it becomes a black hole. That's how stellar mass black holes are created.  Supermassive black holes are created in mergers of existing stellar mass black holes. ",

            "answer_text": "Black Holes form from the Gravitational Collapse of large stars. This occurs usually after the star is unable to keep up with its current shape as a giant star, and starts to contract under its own gravity. A giant star uses its 'fuel' inefficiently, burning lots of it in a short time. After the process of stellar nucleosynthesis is unable to provide the star enough energy to maintain its state, the star starts contracting under its own gravity. This may have several consequences, and the result depends upon the mass of the remaining matter in the star. This is because the outer layers of the star could be exploded away due to a supernova explosion, or from a pulsating star (pulsar). This remaining mass can be substantially smaller than the original star. If the mass of the remaining matter of a star exceeds 3-4 times that of the sun, which can happen due to the large mass of the original star or the remnant creating accretion to engulf matter, then the contraction in the remaining matter under gravity will be unstoppable by almost any kind of internal pressure inside the matter. In this case the remaining matter will go on collapsing to form a black hole. As the collapse occurs, the gravity of the contracting mass becomes increasingly intense in the nearby region, and the Escape Velocity from its surface goes on increasing. Eventually, the escape velocity reaches the speed of light, and after that point nothing can escape from the surface when it is at a particular distance from the centre of the black hole. This region is known as the event horizon of a black hole. At the centre of most galaxies, super-massive black holes are believed to exist. The rest of the matter in the galaxy revolves around it. Black Holes exist for a very long time. No black hole in the universe has evaporated completely yet, since the time of Big Bang. ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes are objects of extreme density, with such strong  gravitational attraction that even light cannot escape from their grasp  if it comes near enough. How Do Black Holes Form?There are three types of Black Holes : primordial black holes, stellar black holes and super-massive black holes. The smallest ones are known as primordial black holes. These black holes are thought to have formed in the early universe, soon after the big bang. Scientists  believe this type of black hole is as small as a single atom but with  the mass of a large mountain. Stellar black holes formed by certain dying stars. A star with a mass greater than about 3 times the mass of our Sun may produce a black hole at the end of its life. When a star runs out of nuclear fuel, gravity gets the upper hand and the material in the core is compressed even further. The more massive the core of the star, the greater the force of gravity that compresses the material, collapsing it under its own weight to create a stellar black hole. Astronomers aren't certain how supermassive black holes form. They may  form from the collapse of large clouds of gas, or from the mergers of  many smaller black holes, or a combination of events. Black Holes Trivia:Do you know that almost anything could be compressed into black hole if it got pushed  within its own Schwarzschild Radius. To get the sun to turn into a black hole, it would need to be pushed  down to about 3 kilometers in radius. The Earth would need to be  pressed into having a radius of 8.7 millimeters. source: Black Holes: Facts, Theory & Definition Page on www.universetoday.com              HubbleSite - Reference Desk - FAQs              Schwarzschild radius ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks! Nivedita it came as a surprise when NASA announced few years before that two of its space telescopes caught a huge burst of X-ray spewing out of a super massive black. What is unique about this giant flare is it appeared to be triggered by the eruption of a massive corona (charged particles) from the \u201cblack hole\u201d. [1] If nothing can get out of a black hole, how did the corona come out of it?  Its found that the speed of corona from supermassive black hole is 20% of speed of light. (Corona is developing in left picture and coronal discharges in middle and right side of the pic) Do black holes really a so called \u201cblack hole\u201d? I doubt! NASA\u2019s observation has only bolstered his theory that \u201ctrue\u201d black holes do not exist and that the so-called black holes are in fact hot balls of magnetized plasma (ionized gas stripped of electrons). As a massive star contracts to the size of a black hole, the radiation trapped within the extremely hot star must exert an outward force to counter the gravitational pull resulting into a state of eternal contraction with an infinitesimally slow rate, Mr.Mitra explained.  \u201cThus, instead of true black holes predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory, we proposed that massive stars end up as balls of fire \u2014 termed Magnetospheric Eternally Collapsing Objects or MECOs.\u201d Description of accretion disks: MECOs possess accretion disks around them, something similar to the rings of Saturn, and also may be immersed in a sea of interstellar gases  Gas streams pulled inward by gravity get extremely hot by friction and may radiate X-rays. best example of a magnetized ball of fire is our Sun which is surrounded by a tenuous aura of plasma called Corona.  Instabilities associated with this magnetized plasma result in intermittent eruptions from the Sun in the form of solar flares and coronal mass ejections.\u201d While a true black hole cannot possess any intrinsic magnetic field, there can be magnetic field associated with the disk or gas surrounding a MECO. Therefore, black hole is \u201ctrue black hole\u201d ?? I don't think. Although, it is MECOs. (Magnetospheric Eternally Collapsing Objects) (: Footnotes[1] http://black hole has major flare/nasa",

Theoretical studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, the core of a massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time. ",

A star light ups because of there's nuclear fusion of HYDROGEN NUCLEI into HELIUM nuclei in the core of STAR.But as time passed this hydrogen fuel is get consumed eventully all HYDROGEN in Core is converted into HELIUM.Then the star expandes 100-200 times it's original radius called as RED SUPERGIANT . Now at the core due to increased preassure Hydrogen fuses into carbon this fusion as follows : Hydrogen>Helium>Carbon>Neon>Oxyg en>Silicon>Iron. After each fusion the energy realesed after fusion process decreases and it becomes very less when the SILICON is FUSED in IRON.When it happns star dies because of until this moment there's equivalence between GRAVITY which attracting all matter the core of star and HEAT PRODUCED during FUSION which acts in opp. Direction of gravity.But as no heat is released by fusion of Silicon CORE OF BLACK HOLE SHRINKS AND STAR EZPLODES IN VOILENT EXPLOSION CALLED SUPER NOVA,Which leads to formation of BLACK HOLE. I hope this helped you in your studies. I tried to make it as simple as possible. ",

            "answer_text": "When a massive star uses up (fusion), its hydrogen, it starts on its helium, and then works its way through the periodic table until it gets to iron. At this point it cannot (directly), use the fusion process on iron, but it has expanded so much, it starts to collapse (gravitationally). This compresses the star further, and  (if it is sufficiently massive), the resulting compression heats it up to the point where all the remaining fuel explodes in a massive supernova. The star 'blows off' a great deal of its mass, but the effect of the explosion also goes the other way, towards the centre of the star; it 'implodes'. The implosion in such a star is of sufficient magnitude to 'fuse' iron, and even heavier materials, and also to further compress the star into a singularity. A singularity is, in effect, a one dimensional point in space, containing enormous mass. So much mass that nothing can reach escape velocity, not even light. At this point, a 'black hole' is formed, and the star will consume all remaining matter within reach of its gravity.  rafe ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes are just ex-stars that have gravitationally collapsed under their own weight. Their gravitational fields are so strong that nothing escapes from it. So they are essentially invisible. But the interaction of a black hole with surrounding matter and electromagnetic radiation helps us identify them. We can also distinguish between the two kinds of black holes stellar and super massive. A black hole has three characteristic parameters: mass, charge, angular momentum.                                                                                                                                                                                Current theories state three ways of black hole formation. First is when massive star implodes under its own gravitational force into a point of infinite density. Second is when two neutron stars merge. This can happen when two neutron stars which are in a binary relationship spiral toward each other by losing energy through gravitational radiation. Stephen Hawking proposes that black holes could have been formed at the time of big bang itself. ",

            "answer_text": "All stars, including the Sun, constantly have two forces acting against each other at once. The two forces are the inward force of gravity and the the outward force from radiation released as hydrogen forms into helium. Spoiler: the force of gravity wins in the long run. Throughout a star\u2019s live, hydrogen (the sun\u2019s fuel) is constantly being fused into helium. A star as big as our Sun will fuse hydrogen into helium for 10 billion years. The smaller the star\u2019s mass, the longer it will burn. Red dwarf stars (smaller than the sun; the smallest a star can get) can burn for trillions of years. But what happens when a star 20x larger than the sun\u2019s mass runs out of hyrodgen? Now there is no more interior pressure. Gravity wins and the core of the star collapses to a point where the helium is fused into carbon. Helium, being the source that would ignite nuclear reactions within the sun will eventually run out. Once this stage occurs, the core of the star faces gravitational collapse. According to Chris Impey in his book Einstein\u2019s Monsters, after the core faces gravitational collapse, \u201cthe Sun will have a brief pyrotechnic phase as the last fuel is used up, ejecting about a third of its mass in a shell of has moving at supersonic speed. The fast-moving has heats up and glows, producing the gorgeous hues of a planetary nebula. Anyone watching the Sun from another star system in 5 billion years will see a spectacular light show. Anyone watching from the Earth will be in a lot of trouble, since the ejected gas will vaporize the biosphere and obliterate all live.\u201d  When there is no internal pressure form the core of the dying star, a multi-billion-degree wave blasts out from the star, which is commonly known as a supernova. This only occurs with stars about 20x the mass of our Sun\u2019s. What remains of the star is pulled into itself by its singularity. The singularity creates an event horizon, where no information (including light) can escape.  ",

A star has pressure pushing out and gravity sucking in ,this gravitational force is balanced by the nuclear forces(that apply pressure) but when star runs out of nuclear fuel it collapses under its own gravity . For small stars after the nuclear fuel runs out and gravity takes over repulsion among its elections prevent in from further collapsing and thus it becomes \"white dwarf\"When a very massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel it explodes as a supernova. The outer parts of the star are expelled violently into space, while the core completely collapses under its own weight.For bigger stars their it explodes into supernova and the core remains if the core is big enough it would definitely collapse under its own weight and thus forming black hole .

When a big star has run out of fuel it can't stop gravity pulling its gas together, squeezing it tighter and tighter until it warms a tiny neutron star, or a black hole. When a star when a star such as our Sun gets old, it begins to expand. It becomes a red giant or supergiant. This is because as it uses up its fuel hydrogen, its Centre or core becomes smaller and hotter. That leads to its expansion. Once it's hot enough, a red giant starts to burn a new fuel called Helium. That pushes the outer layers of the star further out. The star then begins to lose these layers as a nebula and eventually emerges as a small, white dwarf star. ",

            "answer_text": " When a star runs out of fuel, it collapses. The star becomes smaller and denser. As this happens, the entire mass of the star gets concentrated into one point as it contracts. The size of the star becomes smaller than its Schwartzchild radius. In accordance, with Einstein's theory, as the mass of the object with respect to its size increases, the curvature of spacetime around that object increases due to which the strength of the gravitational force also imcreases. So at a specific point, the concentration of the mass becomes so high due to which the force of gravity exerted by the collapsing star increases and spacetime is ruptured , resulting in the formation of a black hole. I will suggest you to refer to Stephen Hawking's Black Holes and Baby Universes along with other books for a better explanation.

(P.S. for earth to be a black hole, it would have to be compressed to a size of a mosquito) How do stars achieve this radius? See, the temperature inside a star is so massive that there is a massive amount of outward pressure on the gases. Thus, the star does not collapse. Soon, the nuclei of these gases fuse with each other to form heavier gases. This means less nuclei to fuse, which in turn means less heat generated, which further means less outward pressure. Soon, there are so less nuclei remaining that the amount of outward pressure experiences a great drop. No pressure, and the same amount of gravity. This gravity makes the star collapse upon itself, and thus it achieves the radius given above and turns in to a black hole. Cheers :) ",

            "answer_text": "Conventional wisdom says a black hole is made from supernova, except that creates degenerate pressure on a spot where a singularity already existed. The result is actually a pulsar degrading to a neutron star.  The correct answer is that a singularity of any magnitude is created by virial force perturbation. These are the right handed unit spin ideal generators of the universe. They are perfect for active cores of planets and stars. A black hole is presumably a singularity of celestial or solar system magnitude. A galactic magnitude is possible, but would not be able to evolve the same due to excessively vast distances and the normal processes of the parts.  To create a singularity of one magnitude requires a greater magnitude of contributing virial perturbation. Only mass of a lesser magnitude can be pushed into such a singularity. It is then pushed back out ultimately too. ",

But when a star runs out of fuel in the core,its gravitational forces dominate again,there is not enough time for the file to go to core so,it fuses where it is,which causes star to expand. When all fuel is completed then it starts to compress,it produces sooo much heat that it ejects the surface of star and very dense core is left behind. If that core is mass under 0.5 solar masses we call it a white dwarf. If it's mass is in between 0.5 to 3 solar masses we call it neutron star. Neutron star is soooooooooo dense that if you throw a marshmallow at it would produce heat produced by bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Well if that core has mass more than 3 solar masses it would compress even more and form a black hole. A black hole has intense gravity that at a point even light can't escape it we call that point as 'event horizon'. ",

Actually, in a star fusion reactions takes place continuously which converts hydrogen to helium and the huge amount of energy released in this process enables a star not to collapse under its own gravitation. But when all hydrogen gas of a star finishes, all its matter approaches the core and a sudden release of energy creates a great scattering of all the matter. This in small level known as novae and on large level known as supernovae and hypernovae. So if a star having mass at least 3 times our sun undergoes supernovae it will create a black hole. Also the neutron stars(stars having mass 1.4 to 3 times the sun which have undergone supernovae) may collide with each other to form black holes. ",

Schwarzscild conceived a polar coordinate solution to a mass point's, a theoretical construct representing a star or planet, graviational field that expressly forbid any singularity of so-named event horizon or gravitational pull equal to or exceeding C. Answer 1: black holes cannot be formed because nothing of the kind exist.  Answer 2: there has never been any proof. Only unsubstantiated claims.  Around the time of Einstein's emergence, of which he shares some blame, astrophysics and cosmology were hijacked by mathematicians. Both fields transitioned from observational science to paper invention. With math,  as Bertrand Russell described, one can never know what they're talking about or if what they're talking about is true. This description, after and still in the mathematician coup of universal mechanics, goes far to explain why most of astrophysics is incomprehensible nonsense. ",

Gravitational singularity  \"Many theories in physics have mathematical singularities of one kind or another. Equations for these physical theories predict that the ball of mass of some quantity becomes infinite or increases without limit. This is generally a sign for a missing piece in the theory, as in the ultraviolet catastrophe, renormalization, and instability of a hydrogen atom predicted by the Larmor formula.\"  The missing piece of the theory is plasma, 99% of the universe and how it really behaves in space. See 2:20 on the timeline.    It is not particles orbiting a zero volume point of infinite mass, but particles orbiting a common electromagnetic center. The sooner cosmologists begin treating plasma like plasma and stop treating it like solids, liquids and gasses, the sooner cosmology can get out of the Fairie Dust rut it is stuck in. Even the mathmatical formulas for collapsing stars fail to work as advertised, despite being able to manipulate all the parameters. Why Won't the Supernova Explode?   For over 40 years the math has failed to work - yet it's all we hear about anyways - while ignoring the fact that plasma does not behave like solids, liquids and gasses. Yet cosmologists still continue to treat plasma - 99% of the universe - like solids, liquids and gasses - planetary systems. And then because they do so, require you to have faith in 96% ad-hoc assumptions.   ",

The pressure and temperature creates a suitable environment for nuclear fusion to take place. Its all thanks to gravity. So hydrogen forms helium. This process continues for light years together. The energy released due to fusion counteracts the force of gravity.Slowly and eventually, hydrogen starts getting depleted. Helium then fuses to form carbon. Then carbon fuses to form iron. The core of the star becomes iron by the time when there is no more file left to sustain nuclear fusion.This means, gravity finally wins. This causes to core/star to collapse into itself. Now, stars of mass greater than 20 times the mass of Sun, will explode into a Supernova and collapses.  There are chances the star might become a neutron star or a black hole. If the core's mass after supernova is more than 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, no force of the star is capable to fend off the immense force of gravity. This core then becomes a black hole. ",

It is important to note this is from the Theory of Super Relativity and not from main stream physics. I am a metaphysician and not a physicist. I encourage you to seek additional answers to your question and decide for yourself what makes the most sense to you. The theory of Super Relativity is a product of sensible logic and observational patterns. ",

            "answer_text": "A black hole is a region of space-time exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing\u2014not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light\u2014can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform space-time to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it, it appears to have no locally detectable features. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved space-time predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe. The strength of the gravitational field is measured in terms of the curvature. And because black holes are very massive and they are very small, their gravity is very strong and creates a very large curvature of space-time.  The strength of the gravitational field is measured in terms of the curvature. And because black holes are very massive and they are very small, their gravity is very strong and [creates] a very large curvature of space-time. One way to characterise the curvature is something called the Schwarzschild radius: Rs = Gn M/c^2 Where is Gn Newton's constant of gravity, M is mass of the object and c is speed of light. The Schwarzschild radius is, more or less, the size that a given object, with a given mass, should have in order for it to be a black hole. For instance, if we managed to concentrate all the mass of the Earth into a sphere of a radius of a few centimeters, then that object would be a black hole. ",

            "answer_text": "The stars with a mass which is greater than 20 times the mass of the sun in its normal state will eventually go on to have a mass which is greater than 3 times the mass of the sun when all of the hydrogen and helium on its surface gets used up. Once this happens, we call them neutron stars(neutron stars are basically just the remnant cores of the stars). Now, these stars will go on to turn into white dwarves. But since their mass was so large, not even electron degeneracy pressure can stop them from collapsing further. Hence, it results in a supernova explosion and all of the remnant mass gets concentrated into a tiny sphere(singularity). Thus, this tiny sphere of mass has infinite density. This tiny sphere is called a black hole.  P.S. Not all stars turn into black holes. Only those having a mass which is greater than the Chandrashekhar limit can turn into these bizarre yet brilliant objects. Hope that helps! ",

I mean in the ordinary little lab at school so I don't think I should share that particular theory, just in case I'm right. There'll always be someone willing to try it. I mean it's safe at first, and requires the continuous input of energy to keep it growing. But there will come a point when it nolonger needs an unwitting lab assistant, when it's able to feed itself. From then on it would require the input of high amounts of energy to break it up. But eventually even the energy of the Sun won't be enough to destroy it and hurling it toward the Sun would only give it something to feed on. Science talks about neutron stars, specifically ones that have been paired off with an ordinary star and how its dense gravitational mass could allow it to suck material off its companion. I think they may have even found one, at least I seem to remember a news item where an astronomer described having found one. And I wondered, what if it wasn't a neutron star at all but a once green and living world like ours and they had reached the point in their development where we are now and they had experimented but left it too late. Of course, for now it's all just hyperthetical, we hope. But if I could think off it\u2026 ",

As their is a general law of getting to stable state fast ,followed by everything ,thus stars also do so . If this thirst is quenched then , it forms a white dwarf ,but if not fulfilled then it forms a black hole . I sometimes wonder if it's a star or a witch .

Physically black hole is a celestial massive object of a condensed matter in certain almost dimensionless point,it is called singularity,it has an event horizon of radius given as R=2 GM/C^2,where G is Newton constant,M its mass and C is light speed.Any object cross its even horizon it becomes a kind of information deposited on the horizon surface.Time within horizon is frozen because of the very high gravity,no light is emitted from the interior of the black HOLE.IT is expected there is at least one black hole in the nucleus of each galaxy(there are 10^11 galaxies) in the universe.Thermodynamically when objects fall within its horizon it increases its entropy,where its entropy is S=AC^3/4hbarG. Also it radiates heat with wavelength about the size of black hole,with a temperature called Hawking T=h bar/8piMG. Where hbar is the reduced Plank constant h,G is Newton constant,and M is the mass of the black hole.Tis about 10^-8 kelvin.This is in general the physical properties of black hole.The formation of black hole to be understood there are a complicated mathematical and geometrical concepts and steps,but by description one can say the minimum requirement for for forming black hole is the mass is 1.4 of our sun mass,and the radius is it least Schwartzchild radius.One way of forming B.H. for example,collapse of neutron stars,or massive supernova.Time at B.H.singularity ends.I hope this will satisfy your request.

Normally stars do fusion reaction in their cores and with this reaction, they create materials like Hydrogen, helium, carbon, neon, and Iron. Fusing iron happens at the last stage of the fusion. When it reaches the stage of creating iron the star stop from releasing energy and that causes to break the balance between the radiation and the gravity of the star, because producing iron makes the gravity of the star bigger than the energy radiated from the star. Breaking the balance of the star causes the star to collapse on itself and thus creating a black hole. ",

And when enough iron accumulates inside the core of the atar , the star begins to collapse under its own gravity. The gravity there is so immense that it starts to literally eats itself.  When it cannot digest much matter, there is gamma ray burst which is followed by supernova.  It can have two outcomes, either the core becames a neutron star or black hole.

            "answer_text": "When a star having 30 solar masses as our sun then there is conflict between its nuclear energy and its gravity, the star uses hydrogen as its fuel when it is nearly ran out then it starts producing a new element by slaming two atoms of hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms having huge amount of kinetic energy slams into another and thus giving birth to a new element Helium. Helium having more calorific value than Hydrogen , increases the nuclear energy of the star and making the star inflate into a red supergiant.  When helium is also completly runs out then the star suddenly loses 1/4th of its mass through a blast called super nova and and the remaing core is called as White Dwarf then it loses nearly every thing and the core is only left composed of 0nly neutrons and thus it got its name neutron star.  At last in the battle of gravity vs nuclear energy , gravity wins ,a dark black sphere starts engulfing the neutron star till its surface is completely engulfed and leaves a dark sphere of no matter nearly the size of central london , simply it leaves a hole in space time. From who\u2019s gravitational field light even cannot escape the region of nothing other than a freezed space time, the BLACK HOLE .  ",

However there is no such thing as a black hole because when GOD sent all the stars on their way 6,000 years ago they all mutually rejected each other and spread out into the entire volume of space and just keep on moving apart - just as astronomers see.

There is the chandler limit, which says that if you have this much matter, the electric fields that normally make matter springy simply don't work well enough to stop the weight crushing the body, and you get variously neutron stars and denser matter. Black holes cause a number of problems if one suppose that gravity is purely attractive, and one can not explain how gravity escapes if light can't.  Other models present what we see as black holes as vortices, and as the radius gets smaller, the co-gravitational field gets much larger, and matter is blasted out either end of the vortex.  These rays, once in flight, are still under co-gravitational forces, and hence diverge, giving a spherical discharge above and below the system. ",
