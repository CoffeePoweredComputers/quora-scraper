            "answer_text": "Good Question! This is a question that arises in everyone's mind and a question to which even our economists are finding it difficult to encapsulate.  Economics, according to me is Study of Human BehaviorAnd,how we react to different situations? Hence, It is more of a study of our emotional responses to different circumstances..But, our economists have taken great labor to analyze thousands of such responses and laid down: Bulk of LiteratureConclusions of the common behavioral patternMade assumptions based on their experimentsTested them over and over againFinally laid down theories(eg; The Law of Demand and its Exceptions)Therefore, Economics is Scientific(As anything which involves experimentation,observation and conclusion stating the experiment true is science) Yet, it is NOT completely scientific because it includes human beings.... For example, The Law Of Demand is a valid theory and all of us would agree. But take the exceptional case of an irrational consumer. A person who buys more as price goes up(this could even be because of some of the exceptions but , we aren't taking it as one). There the LAW OF DEMAND would fail! Yes, you may say who would do that? But we are answering whether it is scientific or or. Hence, to be called a perfect science it would have to be always true.But it isn't possible to draw that conclusion.  Therefore, Economics is semi-scientific... A very interesting branch of study where science and psychology unite. ",
