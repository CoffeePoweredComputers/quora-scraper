            "answer_text": "It is becoming too slow for today: It takes too long to publish because all the formalities have to be checked rigorously. It so slow that it took so long to validate Einstein's papers that they awarded a Nobel prize after his death. Nowadays technology is pushing so fast and the slower scientific method cannot keep up with it. As a result, many startups bring out products to try them out experientially on people so they can tell if they will work or not. Thet don't say so, but many do in Neurotech/Biotech in specific. Academics would be better finding more ways to work closer with startups and tech companies.Too bureaucratic: To publish a paper there are processes and politics involved. At the end of day, some people want to prove something, not run for President.Contradicting by definition: The method is looking to prove that something is true until it is proven false. The premises of the methodology as well as experience in applying it show they are all proven false, or incomplete. So something is right until it is wrong. So is it right or wrong? With the shortening times-to-falsification/update, validation is becoming a bigger problem.The time-to-falsification/update is shortening: It seems that today the times to falsification or update of a theory are shortening. The method cannot be fast enough to catch up.Too many theories: Most models including that of the scientific method are not examined for how they would work at the limits. If you have to cross-validate one theory against another 10, the model works. If there are 1,000,000,000 theories, it takes much longer and may even be impossible. I would guess the model will not be capable to handle the growth of existing knowledge.Excessive checking of short term issues and long-term effects: Another issue with the method, particularly for medicine and health sciences is that scientists spend too much effort is spent trying to find short-term issues and long-term effects. The bottom line is that anything that has a positive always has negative side-effects. And long term effects are becoming pointless to study because the world is developing so fast that there is no need to know what will happen in the long term, as there will be either a new solution by then, or the old theory will have already been debunked, so all the long term results won\u2019t matter.Ultimately, I would predict that the next change of the scientific method may be a form of open experimental practice of new theories. That means to immediately make a prototype, such as a formula, substance or a device that seems to produce a result, and release it to the public within a short space of time without extended validation by the scientific community.

            "answer_text": "The scientific method is a method, a process, a recipe, for creating technology. It\u2019s like asking, \u201cwhat flaws exist with bread?\u201d It\u2019s hard to argue when you\u2019re already consuming the bread, and it\u2019s delicious. My smartphone is delicious. Quora is delicious. Fast cars, rocket ships, and moon landings are all delicious. Nothing that is wrong with the scientific method has withheld us from these things. But we can play devil\u2019s advocate and challenge science all we want if we are to be open about it: Knowledge problem. We cannot know for certain. We cannot know everything. We cannot know on demand. These are physical constraints of being a human and the I/O of any system. It does not challenge the methods we use to make use of our limited capacity.Abstraction problem. This is also the definition and the language problem. Words are not the things they represent. The word \u201capple\u201d will never replace an actual apple, and no mathematical or computational representation would perfectly replicate a physical apple either. Models are just models. But this is the premise of science, not a flaw. Science is about building models, comparing them, updating them, and using them to build electric cars and space ships.Measurement problem. This is a task, not a flaw. To measure something requires time, money, and often machines. Particle accelerators are not cheap. But they are not tools to overcome the flaws of the scientific method. They are tools used to fulfill it. With more accurate measurements, and more detailed observations, we have better evidence. All scientific advancement stems from better evidence and theories erected from them. This is part of the work. This is the act of science.Time lapse problem. This is simply a case of a flawed hypothesis and limited data. If we know there is a time lapse problem, we can solve it. Being tricked by our observations isn\u2019t a flaw of science. It\u2019s a flaw of our observations and the resulting incompleteness of our data. Our theory later not working will tell us we were wrong and were missing something. This is the scientific method working, not breaking.Objective limitations. Indeed science cannot tell us what is valuable, ethical, or moral. Or can it? Many subjective arguments can be made objective. Democracy is a way of objectifying the will of a group of people and granted them the power to make a physical, objective difference. \u201cI like cake\u201d may be subjective. \u201cJohan likes cake\u201d is an objective statement. Why and how people in general like cake can be made into a scientific problem, and knowledge can be reaped to better the making of our cakes.Observation problem. What we see is what we see. No more, and no less. Science is limited to observation. But again, this is not a flaw, but a feature. Science is how we maximize the derivatives of what we see and experience without muddling the evidence with imagination and bias.Philosophy problem. Do we really exist? Aren\u2019t we all a simulation running on brains in jars whereby all science and evidence is manipulated by the simulator? Sure, you go think about that. This is not a flaw or even a weakness of science. Falsification tells us to let these questions go. What cannot be immediately physically tested does not immediately physically exist. We can put those problems off until some physical aspect of their influence emerges, at which point the problem becomes scientifically relevant.Choice and bias. This is not a flaw of science, but being the antidote is one of it\u2019s primary functions. Science is not picky, nor bias. But scientists are. That is why they stick to the scientific method to negate their own subjective influence. If you made a bad choice, the evidence will tell you. The results of the test will tell you. The math will tell you. If two theories give the same result, then science will tell you that both theories are valid. This is not a flaw of any system. And if a scientist has biases or preferences or financial motives, they are either part of a conspiracy or an open and transparent part of the problem. Any public biases can be vindicated by experiment, and a scientist can start by testing their favorite hypotheses on their favorite subjects all day long. What they cannot do is muddle the data or manipulate information. But this is not an act of science. It is an act of politics. The flaw is with the human. Or maybe it isn\u2019t even a flaw if they are doing what they set out to do. They are just politicians before they are scientists and trying to be sneaky about it.Flaws are what inflict perfect diamonds and perfect people. Science is neither a diamond nor a person. It\u2019s just a way of figuring things out. It\u2019s like asking what flaws would logic itself hold as if it were the same as asking what flaws exist with our logic. Flaws here are part of the problem, not the device that is being used to solve them. As with any hammer that can accidentally strike your thumb, or deliberately bash a skull, science can be dangerous. Scientists working on radioactive materials have died trying to discover their properties. Scientists who have successfully created nuclear bombs have helped murder millions and radioactively poison even more. Recipies, processes, methods\u2026 they can all be refined and honed and practiced in ways to be more perfect. They can be made safer, more fault tolerant, less addictive, faster, cheaper, etc. But being able to improve on something doesn\u2019t make it flawed. What is important about the scientific method is the part that works. Like the weight that drives the nail, the principle of how a hammer works is quite simple, elegant, concise, accurate, practical, physical, and real. The scientific method is about tapping into a mechanism. And like a hammer, or any other tool, none of the flaws mentioned by other answers are enough to deter us. The only thing that could displace the scientific method would be a new method, that would tap in to the nature of something else \u2014 something so much more powerful, safe, and effective, that the old method would be made obsolete. At which point, deeming it a stupid and flawed choice. ",
