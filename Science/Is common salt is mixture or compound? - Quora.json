            "answer_text": "common salt means NaCl composed of two DIFFERENT type of elements sodium and chlorine therefore it\u2019s a compound mixtures are not chemically bonded they are just simple mix of two or more than two substances which can be separated through physical means but a compound is made after chemical reaction between two or more than two elements the most important thing is that you can write formula for compounds such as H2O , MgSO4 , NaCl etc but how would you be able to write such a formula for air which is a MIXTURE of numerous gases.YOU CANNOT WRITE chemical formula for mixtures.

            "answer_text": "Salt by itself IS only a compound. Unfortunately, today, everything is tainted (sea salt) or a mixture of the surrounding elements from the location and the surrounding elements of where the mining took place from the local area\u2019s weathering. IF the compound is put thru a purification process then maybe it is a pure compound. BUT we infuse todays salt for human consumption with iodine, or an anti clumping ingrediant. To keep it loose in the shaker. So NO it would be a mixture of sorts. But again I am NOT a chemist. In industry, I always USUALLY made good friends with the chemists on staff if we were in the same area working. I needed and valued their input. ",
