            "answer_text": "Generally blankets block more air movement, they are a larger thermal mass, and thus absorb and hold more heat. Waterproof and lightproof aluminium core plastic like the emergency blankets are the most thermally conserving for the weight, and especially in that it blocks water and wind, as well as trapping radiative heat and warm are inside. The other thing is blankets are usually made of hydrophobic materials and convection combined with evaporation gives the most heat loss. This is also why hydrophobic materials are always the best for winter clothing. When cotton or linen get wet, they suck heat out of you, whereas synthetics and wool or other animal hair fibres retain lots of tiny air pockets and thus do not rapidly wick away heat. ",
