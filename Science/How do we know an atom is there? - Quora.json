            "answer_text": "Atoms are small. Really, really small. You\u2019ll probably have heard that matter is made of bundles of these tiny things. You\u2019ll likely also know that you can\u2019t see them with the naked eye. We are told to take on trust the idea that atoms are there, interacting with each other and being building blocks for our world. For most people, though, that\u2019s not good enough. Science prides itself on the way it uses real observations to work out the mysteries of the universe \u2013 so how did we come to conclude that atoms exist, and what have we learned about these tiny structures? It might seem as if there\u2019s a simple way to prove atoms exist: put them under the microscope. But this approach won\u2019t work. In fact, even the most powerful light-focusing microscopes can\u2019t visualise single atoms. What makes an object visible is the way it deflects visible light waves. Atoms are so much smaller than the wavelength of visible light that the two don\u2019t really interact. To put it another way, atoms are invisible to light itself. However, atoms do have observable effects on some of the things we can see. Visible light cannot reveal individual atoms (Credit: Yevgen Lyashko/Alamy Stock Photo) Visible light cannot reveal individual atoms (Credit: Yevgen Lyashko/Alamy Stock Photo) Hundreds of years ago in 1785 Dutch scientist Jan Ingenhousz was studying a strange phenomenon that he couldn\u2019t quite make sense of. Minute particles of coal dust were darting about on the surface of some alcohol in his lab. Even the most powerful light-focusing microscopes can\u2019t visualise single atoms About 50 years later, in 1827, the Scottish botanist Robert Brown described something curiously similar. He had his microscope trained on some pollen grains. Brown noticed that some of the grains released tiny particles \u2013 which would then move away from the pollen grain in a random jittery dance. At first, Brown wondered if the particles were really some sort of unknown organism. He repeated the experiment with other substances like rock dust, which he knew wasn\u2019t alive, and saw the same strange motion again. It would take almost another century for science to offer an explanation. Einstein came along and developed a mathematical formula that would predict this very particular type of movement \u2013 by then called Brownian motion, after Robert Brown. Einstein\u2019s theory was that that the particles from the pollen grains were being moved around because they were constantly crashing into millions of tinier molecules of water \u2013 molecules that were made of atoms. It might come as a surprise that atoms can be broken down \u2013 particularly since \u201catomos\u201d means \u201cindivisible\u201d \u201cHe explains this jiggling motion that you see as actually being caused by the impact of individual water molecules on the particles of dust or whatever it is that you\u2019ve got on your liquid,\u201d explains Harry Cliff at the University of Cambridge, who is also a curator at London\u2019s Science Museum. By 1908, observations backed with calculations had confirmed that atoms were real. Within about a decade, physicists would be able to go further. By pulling apart individual atoms they began to get a sense of their internal structure. It might come as a surprise that atoms can be broken down \u2013 particularly since the very name atom derives from a Greek term \u201catomos\u201d, which means \u201cindivisible\u201d. But physicists now know that atoms are not solid little balls. It\u2019s better to think of them as tiny electrical, \u201cplanetary\u201d systems. They\u2019re typically made up of three main parts: protons, neutrons and electrons. Think of the protons and neutrons as together forming a \u201csun\u201d, or nucleus, at the centre of the system. The electrons orbit this nucleus, like planets. Atoms are made up of smaller particles (Credit: Science Photo Library/Alamy Stock Photo) Atoms are made up of smaller particles (Credit: Science Photo Library/Alamy Stock Photo) If atoms are impossibly small, these subatomic particles are even more so. Funnily enough, the first particle that was discovered was actually the smallest of the three \u2013 the electron. To get an idea of the size difference here, protons in the nucleus are actually around 1,830 times as large as electrons. Picture a small marble orbiting a hot air balloon \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of discrepancy we\u2019re talking about here. It\u2019s one of the first particle accelerators in a way But how do we know those particles are there? The answer is because, although tiny, they can have a big impact. The British physicist who discovered electrons, JJ Thomson, used a particularly eye-catching method to prove their existence in 1897. His special device was called a Crookes tube \u2013 a funny shaped piece of glass out of which nearly all the air was sucked by a machine. Then, a negative electrical charge was applied to one end of the tube. This charge was enough to strip the remaining gas molecules in the tube of some of their electrons. Electrons are negatively charged, so they flew down the tube towards the other end. Thanks to the partial vacuum, those electrons were able to shoot through the tube without any big atoms getting in their way. The electrical charge made the electrons move very quickly indeed \u2013 around 37,000 miles per second (59,500 kilometres per second) \u2013 until they smashed into the glass at the far end, knocking into yet more electrons associated with the atoms there. Amazingly, the collisions between these mind-bogglingly tiny particles generated so much energy that it created a fantastic green-yellow glow.

And if you\u2019re wondering how these electrons could go flying around independently of their atoms, that\u2019s because of a process called ionisation, in which \u2013 in this case \u2013 an electrical charge changes the atom\u2019s structure by pushing those electrons off into the space around. In fact, it\u2019s because electrons are so easily manipulated and moved around that electrical circuits are possible. Electrons in a copper wire travel in a train-like motion from one atom of copper to the next \u2013 and it\u2019s that which carries the charge through the wire to the other end. Atoms, it\u2019s worth noting again, are not solid little pieces of matter, but systems that may be modified or undergo structural changes. Light bulbs glow because of the flow of electrons (Credit: Feng Yu/Alamy Stock Photo) Light bulbs glow because of the flow of electrons (Credit: Feng Yu/Alamy Stock Photo) But the discovery of the electron suggested there was more to learn about atoms. Thomson\u2019s work revealed that electrons are negatively charged \u2013 but he knew that atoms themselves had no overall charge. He reasoned they must contain mysterious positively charged particles to cancel out the negatively charged electrons. He had demonstrated the existence of a dense nucleus within the atom Experiments at the beginning of the 20th Century identified those positively charged particles and at the same time revealed the atom\u2019s solar system-like internal structure. Ernest Rutherford and his colleagues took very thin metal foil and put it under a beam of positively charged radiation \u2013 a stream of small particles. Most of the powerful radiation sailed right through, just as Rutherford thought it would, given how thin the foil was. But surprisingly, some of it bounced back. Rutherford reasoned that the atoms in the metal foil must contain small, dense areas with a positive charge \u2013 nothing else would have the potential to reflect the radiation to such a strong degree. He had found the positive charges in the atom \u2013 and simultaneously proved they were all bunched together in a tight mass in a way that electrons aren\u2019t. In other words, he had demonstrated the existence of a dense nucleus within the atom. Cambridge physicist James Chadwick was desperate to discover the neutron However, there was still a problem. By now, the mass of atoms could be estimated. But given what was known about how heavy a particle in the nucleus should be, the idea that they were all positively charged didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cCarbon has six electrons and therefore six protons in the nucleus \u2013 six positive charges and six negative charges,\u201d explains Cliff. \u201cBut the nucleus of carbon doesn\u2019t weigh six protons, it weighs [the equivalent of] 12 protons.\u201d Early on it was thought the other six nuclear particles would have the same mass as protons but be neutrally charged: neutrons. But no-one could prove this. In fact, neutrons weren\u2019t actually discovered until the 1930s. Everything around us is made of atoms (Credit: Magictorch/Alamy Stock Photo) Everything around us is made of atoms (Credit: Magictorch/Alamy Stock Photo) Cambridge physicist James Chadwick was desperate to discover the neutron. He\u2019d been working on the theory for years. In 1932, he made a breakthrough. In the 1930s we had figured out a lot about atoms, but no-one had produced a direct image of one A few years earlier, other physicists had been experimenting with radiation. They fired positively charged radiation \u2013 the same sort that Rutherford had used to discover the nucleus \u2013 at beryllium atoms. The beryllium kicked out radiation of its own: radiation that was neither positively nor negatively charged, and that could penetrate far through material. By this time, others had already worked out that gamma radiation was neutral and deeply penetrating, so the physicists assumed this is what the beryllium atoms were releasing. But Chadwick wasn\u2019t convinced. He generated some of the new radiation himself and aimed it at a substance which he knew was rich in protons. Unexpectedly, the protons were knocked into the air away from the material as though they had been hit by particles with the same mass \u2013 like snooker balls being hit by other snooker balls. Gamma radiation can\u2019t deflect protons this way, so Chadwick realised the particles in question here must have the same mass as the proton but lack its electrical charge: they were neutrons. All the key bits of the atom had been figured out, but the story doesn\u2019t stop there. You can even work out what atoms look like by poking at them Although we had figured out a lot more about atoms than we had before, they were still difficult to visualise. And back in the 1930s, no-one had produced a direct image of one \u2013 which is what many people would want to see in order to really accept that they are there. Importantly, though, the techniques that had been used by scientists like Thomson, Rutherford and Chadwick, would pave the way for new equipment that would eventually help us produce those images. The beams of electrons Thomson generated in his Crookes tube experiment proved particularly useful. Today similar beams are generated by electron microscopes, and the most powerful of these microscopes can actually create images of individual atoms. This is because an electron beam can have a wavelength thousands of times shorter than a light beam \u2013 so short, in fact, that electron waves can be deflected by tiny atoms to generate an image in a way that light beams can\u2019t. Neal Skipper at University College London says such images are useful for people who want to study the atomic structure of special substances \u2013 those used to make batteries for electric cars, for example. The more we know about their atomic structure, the better we can design them to be efficient and reliable. Atomic force microscopes can show us individual atoms (Credit: Flirt/Alamy Stock Photo) Atomic force microscopes can show us individual atoms (Credit: Flirt/Alamy Stock Photo) You can even work out what atoms look like by poking at them. This is essentially how atomic force microscopy works. In a liquid, as you heat it up, you can see the atoms have more disordered configurations The idea is to bring the tip of an extremely small probe close to the surface of a molecule or a material\u2019s surface. At such close quarters, the probe will be sensitive to the chemical structure of whatever it\u2019s pointed at, and the change in resistance as it moves across it allows scientists to produces images of what, for example, an individual molecule looks like. Recently, researchers published wonderful images of a molecule before and after a chemical reaction using this method. Skipper adds that a lot of atomic research today explores how the structure of things changes when a high pressure, or extreme temperature, is applied. Most people know that when a material is heated, it often expands. It\u2019s now possible to detect the atomic changes that occur which makes this possible. \u201cIn a liquid, as you heat it up, you can see the atoms have more disordered configurations,\u201d says Skipper. \u201cYou can see that from the structural map directly.\u201d Skipper and other physicists can also work on atoms using the neutron beams first identified by Chadwick in the 1930s. You can identify atoms by detecting the energy of gamma rays alone \u201cWhat we do a lot is to fire beams of neutrons at lumps of materials and from the scattering pattern that emerges you can figure out that you were scattering neutrons from the nucleus,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can work out the mass and the rough size of the object that was doing the scattering.\u201d But atoms aren\u2019t always just sitting there, calmly stable, waiting to be examined. Sometimes they are decaying \u2013 which means they are radioactive. There are lots of naturally occurring radioactive elements. The process generates energy, which forms the basis of nuclear power \u2013 and nuclear bombs. Nuclear physicists\u2019 research generally involves trying to better understand reactions in which the nucleus undergoes fundamental changes like these. Uranium atoms can split into two (Credit: Peter Hermes Furian/Alamy Stock Photo) Uranium atoms can split into two (Credit: Peter Hermes Furian/Alamy Stock Photo) Laura Harkness-Brennan at the University of Liverpool specialises in the study of gamma rays \u2013 a type of radiation emitted by decaying atoms. A radioactive atom of a given type generates a specific form of gamma ray. That means you can identify atoms by detecting the energy of gamma rays alone \u2013 and this is exactly what Harkness-Brennan does in her lab. We haven\u2019t just worked out what atoms are, we\u2019ve realised that they are marvellously complex structures \u201cThe types of detectors that you would use are detectors that allow you to measure both the presence of the radiation but also the energy of the radiation that\u2019s being deposited,\u201d she says, \u201cand that\u2019s because the nuclei all have a characteristic fingerprint.\u201d Because there might be all sorts of atoms present in an area where radiation is detected, especially after a large nuclear reaction of some kind, it\u2019s important to know precisely which radioactive isotopes are present. This sort of detection is commonly done in nuclear power plants, or areas where there have been nuclear disasters. Harkness-Brennan and her colleagues are now working on detection systems that can be set up in such places to show, in three dimensions, where radiation might be present in a particular room. \u201cWhat you want to do is to have techniques and tools that allow you to image a three dimensional space and tell you in that room, in that pipe, that\u2019s where the radiation is,\u201d she says. Given how small the atom is it\u2019s amazing how much physics we can get out of it It\u2019s also possible to visualise radiation in a \u201ccloud chamber\u201d. This is a special experiment in which alcohol vapour, cooled to -40C, drifts in a cloud around a radioactive source. Charged particles of radiation flying away from the source remove the electrons from alcohol molecules. This makes the alcohol condense into liquid around the path of the emitted particle. The results of this type of detection are really rather stunning. We haven\u2019t just worked out what atoms are, we\u2019ve realised that they are marvellously complex structures that can undergo amazing changes \u2013 many of which occur naturally. And by studying atoms this way, we\u2019ve been able to improve our technologies, harness the energy of nuclear reactions and better understand the natural world around us. We\u2019ve also been able to better protect ourselves from radiation and discover how materials change when placed under extreme conditions. Harkness-Brennan puts it well: \u201cGiven how small the atom is it\u2019s amazing how much physics we can get out of it.\u201d Everything we can see around us is made of these little things. It\u2019s good to know they\u2019re down there, making it all possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Compare the following two statements: The \u201catom\u201d exists and we need evidence to prove it. vs The \u201catom\u201d is the name of the evidence that exists. One is materialist. The atom exists a priori and it\u2019s our job to identify and back it with physical evidence to be scientific. One is positivist. The atom may or may not exist, but all we can say is that we have evidence. The evidence alone speaks, but our task is to translate those physical observations into words we can understand. One is truer than the other. Most of us are materialist, and modern western common sense is materialistic. We stand on a big rock orbiting the sun in a galaxy in the cosmos, and there must be life out there. We just need to prove that it exists. But oddly enough, science was never materialist. The basic tenant of science is to rely only on the evidence to predicate the facts. In other words, the final test for any scientific hypothesis or experiment is a positivist one. We are listening for mother nature to communicate what we need confirmed, such as \u201catom\u201d. And from there, we adjust our models to align with the evidence. In a sense, it\u2019s the first test and the only test. The rest is all guesswork. How did we come up with the atom in the first place? Before we know anything scientifically, we know hypothetically. We guess. We guess based on other things we know already. But before anything is proven to be real, we are quick to give them names. That is the only way we can reason about them. The cosmos, just like the atom, is a mere model built from the evidence we\u2019ve gathered. These models update themselves because science is positivist, not because it is materialist. Only positivism is progressive. Materialism is just a guess. Positivism is the source of truth. Here is a positivist example of atoms. This video isn\u2019t about atoms. It\u2019s in atoms. Seeing this is enough for anyone to understand that atoms exist. But no one will know what they are, beyond being \u201ctiny\u201d and \u201chard\u201d. Both are relative and relatively meaningless, and both are just a guess. It\u2019s a prime example of the materialist point of view generated from a positivist experience.  From Teaching Kids News.

            "answer_text": "A classic proof (18/19th century) that molecules exist is to float a loop of cotton on water, then put a drop of a very dilute solution of an oil in something that rapidly evaporates (such as ether) into the loop, wait a bit, then prod it sideways very gently to see if it is full with a film of oil yet. If the loop dents, it is not. It is observed that after a certain number of drops, the loop becomes resistant to denting and moves across the surface of the water as if solid. Double the concentration of oil in the volatile solvent, and the number of drops needed to reach this point is halved, and so on. If oil were infinitely divisible it would form a very thin film from the first drop, and the behaviour of the loop would change gradually from one drop to the next, not suddenly when enough oil molecules have been deposited to fill the loop with a film one molecule thick (and not change before or after). Other experiments showed that pure substances have chemical formulae with integer ratios between their components, such as C8H10 (octane, 4:5) or CH4O (Methanol, 1:4:1), which supports molecules being made of atoms. If not, why the integers? Today with a scanning tunnelling microscope or electron microscope we can image many molecules and see that the atoms are laid out much as we\u2019d predict with simple mechanical ball-and-string models. (Also exceptions where atoms do not behave in such a simple manner). The ancients looked at crystals and the way they shatter into fragments with the same angles as the parent crystals, and saw \u201catoms\u201d of (say) table salt with the same fundamental shape (little cubes, for salt) as a likely explanation. Not bad for ancient Greece, though not quite correct \u2014 we now know salt to be a compound of Sodium and Chlorine in a 1:1 ratio. Moving into the 20th century, we could observe the way a crystal diffracts X-rays. These results are impossible to explain other than by a crystal being a set of atoms in a fixed arrangement (a unit cell) filling a much larger volume of space in a 3\u2013D grid. It\u2019s also a powerful tool for working out the structure of very complex molecules (such as DNA) if only they can be persuaded to form crystals. Unfortunately, Fourier analysis is not something easily explained without advanced maths! ",

            "answer_text": "Sight is only one way of detecting something, and often a thing is detected by its influence on something else. Someone came up with a theory that atoms exist, and predicted that, if atoms do exist, certain thing will happen (be observed) and certain other things will not be observed. I think it was Niels Bohr and Ernest Rutherford who predicted that, if atoms do not exist, electrons will either not pass through a thin sheet of gold, or all will pass through and none will be deflected by bouncing off atoms. Well, most passed straight through but many were scattered because they hit something. The best explanation anyone could come up with was that the gold sheet consisted of lots of empty space (through which electrons could pass without being deflected) and scattered bits of things electrons bounced off of. These scattered bits are atoms. The theory that atoms exist fit the observations better than any other theory. We \u2018know\u2019 something exists because of its affects on us or on other things. We know trees exist not only because we see them (they could be an illusion or a hologram and we would still see them) but because we observe that things we are confident are not holograms or illusions, things like rocks, bounce off the tree trunks. Blind people cannot see trees, but know they exist. A blind man can bounce rocks off trees he cannot see, Bohr bounced electrons off atoms he could not see. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is the proof atoms exist.  Brownian motion  Another IBMatic proof- a boy made up of atoms. In 1827 botanist Robert Brown was observing pollen grains under microscope and observed that some tiny particles from grains moved away from grains doing jittery dance over water. First he wondered if the particles are some sort of living organisms.But the dedicated scientist want to confirm it. So he repeated the experiment with sand particles and recorded the same observations. Einstein a young and dynamic scientist in 1905 proposed that this motion was due to the inpact of water molecules which were made of atoms on the tiny particles which exert some force on the pollen particles.He calculated the force and size of the water molecules.This motion of pollen particles due to constant collision of the particles with tiny water molecules made up of atoms was named as Brownian motion.Hence existence of atoms was proved. Another one is IBM\u2019s research to make the smallest magnetic memory bit by manipulating the movement of single atom using scanning tunneling microscope. In 2012 they announced a breakthrough that they can store a bit of information on just 12 atoms rather than 1,000,000 atoms used previously. They also have some fun with atoms by making a minute and a thirty four second movie \u201cA Boy And His Atom\u201d. The movie is made by magnifying atoms 100 million times.Each frame was made by depositing carbon monoxide (CO) molecule onto a copper subtrate and imaging it by a scanning tunnel microscope. I was mesmerized by seeing the movie made up of atom manipulation.They also created an IBM Logo using the same technique. Image source-internet. ",

Resolving them in a teardrop may work to view them undergoing electrolysis, this would be a direct observation. It's a bit trying, but possible by naked eye and a drop on the eye. Edit I have actually seen atoms, been able to resolve them ionizing. Through calculations, from biological and sample nanometer references, for a magnification of nearly 20 million times magnification. This magnification increased the chain of atoms to near .5 cm altogether, close to .67 cm at times. Beyond the .1 mm resolution minimum. I understand that this seems impossible, or, in many ways contrary to beliefs in relation to GR, ST, QM, as well as in other sciences. I have generated calculations, tables, graphs, formula derivations, from the observations, which I not only have done around 100 times on different occasions, recently I accomplished my technique with 2 different sources of light, seeing not just a single, but a double ionizing chain. Also, at the magnification I was focusing on, at a midrange between minimum and maximum, I watched their interaction, the 2 light sources, within the medium. Honestly, it was very much the same, though one light source had a more natural blue appearance grey, while the other seemed to take on a more orange appearance, in conjunction with one another in proximity view within the medium/sample/lens.

            "answer_text": "According to Einstein (1905), the movement of polen particles on water, called Brownian motion, is caused by collisions of water molecules with the polen particles. It is a visible evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules. This was confirmed by scientist Jean Perrin in 1908: Brownian motion or pedesis (from Ancient Greek: \u03c0\u03ae\u03b4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 /p\u03ad\u02d0d\u03b5\u02d0sis/ \"leaping\") is the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid (a liquid or a gas) resulting from their collision with the fast-moving atoms or molecules in the gas or liquid.[1] This transport phenomenon is named after the botanist Robert Brown. In 1827, while looking through a microscope at particles trapped in cavities inside pollen grains in water, he noted that the particles moved through the water; but he was not able to determine the mechanisms that caused this motion. Atoms and molecules had long been theorized as the constituents of matter, and Albert Einstein published a paper in 1905 that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist, and was further verified experimentally by Jean Perrin in 1908. Perrin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1926 \"for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter\" (Einstein had received the award five years earlier \"for his services to theoretical physics\" with specific citation of different research). The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.

No doubt you are questioning whether we can be sure about anything we can\u2019t see with our naked eye or touch with our own hands. If so, you need to think a bit about what \u201cseeing\u201d actually consists of: light hits your retina and produces electrochemical impulses that travel down your optic nerve and get dumped into the visual cortex, which has developed a model to interpret what those impulses \u201cmean\u201d about the putative real world. That model is often wrong and can very easily be interfered with by drugs or optics. If you wear glasses that turn everything upside down, within a few weeks your visual cortex will have adapted its model and everything will look normal again until you take the glasses off. Don\u2019t even get me started on \u201ctouching with your own hands\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "This question has been asked and answered many times on Quora. Please check first for previous answers? To a scientist these kinds of questions could be interpreted as slightly insulting, a bit like creationists demanding scientists make something evolve in front of their eyes\u2026. because they appear discount the importance of one of the most important faculties of the human mind. It is called deduction. Science works like a detective story. Like a who dunnit, a science training let's you see connections that the untrained observer misses. Evolution and other theories are the same, it doesn't have to be any one direct thing, but an accumulation of support. Atoms for example betray their presence in countless ways. The key issue is the broad knowledge, you can't be expected to know any of that. So here is a sampling: Way back in the 1830s for example, Faraday had already established that the amount of matter (already known as an equivalent weights in chemistry) involved in electrolysis was directly proportional to the amount of electricity passed, and so when the electron was confirmed as a countable particle much later, then it follows from Faraday's laws that the matter was countable. From his writings though it is clear he already had deduced their existence.Or for example you can only explain gas behaviour by accepting that equal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of particles.f you ever did some chemistry you will find that chemists work in concentrations, not weight, and this relies directly on the theory of collision probability. There's deduction for you. You can't have collisions without something that collides.The existence of the chemical elements, you can't reduce them further by chemical means, just cries out for an explanation. Why should chemistry bottom out so abruptly?Chemical structure too is based on atoms, chemists didn't need any special evidence because they had already worked it all out.You can establish the relative weights of elements from their chemical combinations, so you only have to know the weight of one type of atom to work out the weights of all the rest. Gas theory gives you that.But historically the New Zealand born scientist Rutherford produced convincing evidence when he fired apha particles into foils. What he found is that most went straight through, but a small percentage bounced back with some even returning back toward the source. This was direct evidence for the nucleus, that most of the mass of the foils was concentrated in to small volume that took up less than a ten thousandth of the volume of the foil. After that, even the most dubious of skeptics needed no further convincing. This marks the point in history where particle physics overtook atomic theory, as the component electrons and neutrons were discovered.When Einstein found the photon, that connected atoms to particles of light and opened the way to explain the spectroscopy of atoms, how they interact with light.",

            "answer_text": "From wikipedia \u201cThe scanning tunneling microscope is a device for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles to pass through a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on each of which is an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels\u2014the Fermi level local density of states.\u201d Here you see them: atoms of gold.

Im guesding the existance of the atom was first proven in the 1600s or 1700s in England, but my physics history of that period is somewhat hazy in my memory, as I havent dealt with it since high school some 20+ years ago.

Directly interpretable Z-contrast imaging makes STEM imaging with a high-angle detector an appealing technique in contrast to conventional high resolution electron microscopy, in which phase-contrast effects mean that atomic resolution images must be compared to simulations to aid interpretation.

That's because electron microscopes use a beam of electrons rather than photons, as you'd find in a regular light microscope. As electrons have a much shorter wavelength than photons, you can get much greater magnification and better resolution. Best wishes :) ",
