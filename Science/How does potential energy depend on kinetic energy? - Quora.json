            "answer_text": "In physics, potential energy is the energy possessed by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge, or other factors.[1][2] Common types of potential energy include the gravitational potential energy of an object that depends on its mass and its distance from the center of mass of another object, the elastic potential energy of an extended spring, and the electric potential energy of an electric charge in an electric field. The unit for energy in the International System of Units(SI) is the joule, which has the symbol J. whereas the kinetic energy is an energy depending upon the mass of a body and its state of motion. its written as one-half of mass times the square of the velocity. both are independent quantities. However in conservative fields of force where the total energy of a body remains constant unless some external work has been done. the two forms of energy transformation from one to another. say if E = K.E. + P.E. is constant then a decrease in P.E. leads to increase in K.E. this gives a feeling that the two are not independent- but this is due to a constant value of total energy. the common example is a falling body of mass m in the gravitational field say from height h with initial velocity zero. it starts with a P.E. = m.g.h and K.E. = (1/2) .m. v^2 =0 total energy E = m.g.h when it touches on the ground , h=0 so Total energy is only K.E. = (1/2) .m. v^2 During the motion, m.g.h is constantly decreasing and its velocity is increasing.

            "answer_text": "Let us take any level and consider it zero energy level. For our consideration take ground level as Zoro energy level. Lift a stone of mass m to a height h against gravitational force mg. Than work done against gravitational force mg will be mgh. This work will be stored in the form of potential energy (PE)of stone. Now stone is at rest so it's kinetic energy will be zero. Becausetotal energy E= KE+PE E=0+ mgh (1) Allow stone to fall freely. Let it falls through a distance x then it's PE = mg(h-x) and KE = 1/2 mv^2 so total energy E = mg(h-x)+1/2mv^2 \u2014 (2) where v^2= u^2+2gx as at top it was at rest so u=0 therefore v^2=2gx substituting it in equation (2) we get E = mg(h-x)+1/2m*2gx E=mg(h-x)+1/2*m*2gx. E =mgh- mgx +mgx. E=mgh. Therefore for an isolated system total energy remains constant. (in isolated system external force is zero) That is E = KE + PE in this case E= 0+mgh E=mgh = mg(h-x) + 1/2*mv^2 where v^2=2gx ",
