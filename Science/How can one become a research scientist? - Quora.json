            "answer_text": "Keeping aside the PHD degree, to become a research scientist there are some things needed. I will mention them. To become a research scientist you need to frame your mind according to that. Be curious\u201cNecessity is the mother of invention\u201d. This is true but Curiousity is the Father of invention. Ask questions. Question everything. Things which seem obvious don't take then for granted. In this way you will frame your mind to be curious. 2. Go deep Understand the concepts deeply. Reading and memorising the concepts is not important, understanding is. How to understand? Solve more and more questions on that particular concept. Read the applications of that concept. Try to make your own applications based on the understanding of that concept. Teach your younger siblings the concept in simple words. If you can explain a kid you have understood. 3. Read reaserch material Find and collect the materials based on your research intrests. Reading research material will give your mind the shape to be innovative. Being Innovative and creative is important for reseaeching. All the best. Follow these tips. I hope you will find this useful. Follow my space MessyMindScience ",

            "answer_text": "Hey\u2026see becoming a research scientist is not a rocket science.If you are curious about knowing something or you want to study bout some topic,you jst become passionate about it and start working on it.You do different techniques to find results,analyse it and there you get your answers. But the main point here is, you have to focus and keep learning new things whenever they come your way and be patient for your results to come, as sometimes you may take a lot of time to analyse the results. And also there may come a point of time when you have to again start your topic all over again and then writing thesis,publications and so on\u2026.so thats it\u2026!!! In simple words research is basically detailed study about some topic\u2026!! Hope i could answer to your qustionn..please correct if i\u2019m wrong\u2026it would be appreciated..!! All the best..!!
