            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t rightly know, but I suspect that this is because our metabolism does not require hibernation: we do not subsist solely off of a food source which experiences reliable seasonal scarcity. \u2026 I could suggest that hibernation would be an evolutionary disaster for humans, unable to otherwise defend themselves\u2026 but that is nonsense; many prey animals hibernate and they can\u2019t \u201cdefend\u201d themselves either. If humans needed to hibernate, we\u2019d have been able to design suitable fortification against predation. Whether we\u2019d ever have evolved big brains and such is obviously unknown, but I don\u2019t believe that it would have happened. Hibernation does not accomplish what sleep does, and animals that hibernate also sleep. Hibernation is not a \u201csleep\u201d concern, it is primarily a metabolic concern. ",
