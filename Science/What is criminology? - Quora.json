A person looking for a career in criminal justice will likely first seek to earn a criminology degree. While criminal justice and criminology are certainly related fields, they are not identical.

            "answer_text": "Criminology as the name defines is the study of crime and criminals. But Criminology is subject which tries go into the various related aspects of a crime or criminal. Criminology is closely associated with Sociology because sociology is the study of society. (Crime happens in the society and criminals are part of the society like any other person or citizen).

It is considered closely related to sociology, psychology because criminology studies the crime and criminals by considering various social, Behavioural, psychological, economical related causes which are behind the happening of a crime and a criminal who commits the crime.

Overall if you\u2019re really interested to know about various types and causes of crimes and how, when and why people turn into criminals in detail. Then, Criminology would be a nice and interesting course if you want to pursue it academically. I\u2019m not a scholar or faculty. I just have a Diploma in Criminology and Correctional Administration along with Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Sociology. I would never miss a criminology class in college and would have lengthy discussions with the faculty even after the class timings. Number of students for the diploma course were very few.
