            "answer_text": "Rightly so, I believe. Imagine you want to go to a classical music concert. You want to go, first and foremost, for the music - of course! But hang on - there\u2019s no program? Well, that\u2019s ridiculous. You want to know what pieces are going to be played, and who the composer is, otherwise you mightn\u2019t like it. That\u2019s the whole point of you spending your money on it! You don\u2019t visit the cinema to watch a \u2018film\u2019. You go to watch a film you\u2019ll like, that you\u2019ve chosen. Oh, apparently not. \u2018People come to my concerts because they love the atmosphere!\u2019. The atmosphere, eh? Alright, since you\u2019re an avid lover of nitrogen, you reluctantly oblige - in honour of the goddess Hypotheticalia, of course - and book the show. You arrive. A crowd of people have turned up - more than you\u2019ve ever seen for a classical concert. Must be good then. The music starts, you look back and look in confusion at the sea of ridiculously costumed musicians making their way to the stage in gowns and waving to the wildly cheering audience. We LOVE you, Andre! , you hear. Bit show-offy, isn\u2019t it? You sigh and take a seat, waiting for the pieces to begin, whatever they may be. Except it doesn\u2019t begin. Instead, you hear a painfully cheesy speech about how music unites people and love is great and peace is cool and violins are the answer to world conflicts. Each vague statement is met with ever enthusiastic cheers, so you shrug and do the same. Finally, the music starts - hang on - is that - is that Somewhere Over the Rainbow? Can\u2019t Help Falling in Love? Amazing Grace? They\u2019re nice songs, sure, but where's Beethoven in all this? Where\u2019s any classical music? So this is just a concert of \u2018heart-warming\u2019 cheesy ballad covers, then. Alright, fine. Fine! Just get it over with then - enough with the random bagpipes and life stories and cringey jokes and balloons. Ah - at last. The end is here at last. The finale. Guest acts come and take their bows, thanks are said, flowers are given. What's that? Another encore? Who would have guessed! Non-classical cheesiness ensues for what seems to be eternity. The playing isn\u2019t even especially good, even on his part. In a shocking and unexpected turn of events, the Blue Danube waltz is played, featuring a \u2018hey, everybody get up and dance!\u2019 part. Which just shouldn\u2019t happen. About 20 encores later, each cornier, louder and unbelievably more clich\u00e9d than the last, you are utterly, utterly fed up.  Now, I understand the argument that he\u2019s opening up classical music to a new audience, but is he really? There\u2019s barely any classical music in there, for starters, and the scant few there are the really short, famous ones. Strauss isn\u2019t considered up there with the greats of classical music by any serious listener. If he really cared about and loved classical music then he wouldn't be afraid to play a beautiful concerto or two. Most people go to his concerts, get flooded by some cheesy jibberish and covers and come back claiming to be cultured. And then never listen to some of the really good stuff classical music has to offer. Maybe it might work as a small introduction for kids, but that\u2019s it. It may be snobbish to criticize Andre Rieu, but I just think this: If you\u2019re going to popularize anything you are passionate about, and want to remain true to it, there\u2019s one golden rule: don\u2019t dumb it down!

            "answer_text": "The truth: because people are snobs and cannot see the big picture. The big picture is that Rieu does a really good thing, by attracting normal people towards classical music. That he uses some kitch in it, like nice ladies wearing gowns, or pompous violin direction, ok, it\u2019s not the best taste, but Vivaidi did it, Corelli did it, Gidon Kremer did it (for goodness sake, the 1st time I saw the Kremerata, as a barely post-teenage, my jaw dropped). The big picture is that classical music lost its role as a cultural capital, mondialization and other things lead to a cultural omnivority , every person consumes whatever he wants from different genres. However, that most people listen rap, or pop-rock, and that those genres are flourishing does not mean that those genres are the same level as classical music. Democracy does not work here. In reality, pop-rock uses a very small range of elements, elements still invented by the classical music. Rap and pop-rock are made (in general, not allways) by what Claude-Levy Strauss would define as \u201ctinkerers\u201d, as oposed to \u201cengineers\u201d. Classical music was composed by \u201cengineers;\u201d however kitchy be Rieu\u2019s interpretation, the pieces he plays are still masterpieces, they bring something intelligent in a world dominated by shallowness.
