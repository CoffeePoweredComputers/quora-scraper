            "answer_text": "Yes, brown hair and blue eyes looks beautiful! I actually prefer it. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with blonde hair. The other 2 answers make seemingly valid points while ignoring the elephant in the room. The anglificafion Of fashion is something that has been around for centuries and exists all over the world. People in India purchase skin bleaching cream. Watch any Mexican novela(soap opera) and you\u2019ll see that the most Anglo looking actors are always the lead, while the darker more indigenous actors are playing the maids. This is evident in Asian television as well and is backed up by the number of Asian women have surgery to file Down their bone structure or make their eyes appear wider and more Anglo. Black hair care is a multi million dollar industry, and apart from the natural hair movement, which has seen a recent resurgence, overwhelmingly, the majority of the products are intended to chemically straighten the hair, burn it into submission(see hotcomb) or Cover it all together by use of a wig or weave. White people are encouraged by the media to make themselves appear even whiter by the media. Need proof? Remember when Brittany Spears went brunette and had to hear all sorts of comments like \u201cwhy would you go from a 10 to an 8?\u201d Clearly our society\u2019s standard of beauty strongly favor blond hair. For the record, I\u2019m criticizing the concept that brittney was ridiculed for going brunette as if somehow that was a downgrade to her appearance. I don\u2019t judge women for making choices about appearances, but I do judge the media for pushing unrealistic beauty standards and making us arbitrarily favor some traits over others. So yes, it is for fashion, and yes, it\u2019s the same reason that people of color do it, but no, it\u2019s not such a benign reason. edit: I\u2019ve gathered from some of the responses that this answer is Perceived as offensive to some. I\u2019m confused by this, because at no point do I insult anyone directly. I have never meant to imply that white people shouldn\u2019t dye their hair blonde. I think it\u2019s wrong that all around the world, society is telling women what is beautiful and I\u2019ve noticed certain patterns come up in that, but as a person who\u2019s been dying their hair pink and blue for the last decade and a half, I\u2019d never critique someone for wanting to dye their hair. I\u2019m not sure how my answer ",
