            "answer_text": "This is a stoichiometric kind of question where everything should be converted into moles in order to proceed on with the calculations. First you find the number of moles of oxygen using the following formula: Mole (mol) = Mass (g) / Molar Mass (g/mol) For oxygen, the molar mass is 32g/mol. Therefore the number of moles in 97.4kg of oxygen is (97.4*1000)/32 = 3043.75 From the reaction equation, the ratio of KNO3 to O2 is 4:5. Thus the number of moles of KNO3 is 3043.75 * 4/5 = 2435 mol. If you are looking for the mass of KNO3 needed then Mass (g) = Mole (mol) * Molar Mass (g/mol), 2435*101 = 245935g = 245.935kg ",

            "answer_text": "2435 moles of KNO3 must be heated. 97.4 kg of O2 means there is 97,400 grams of oxygen. Divide by 32 (molar mass of O2) and you get 3,043.75 moles of oxygen. Then if 3043.75 corresponds with 5, X will correspond with 4. Cross multiply then divide for X, X equals 2435 moles of potassium nitrite. Chemistry, boom. ",
