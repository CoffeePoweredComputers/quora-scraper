            "answer_text": "If spirits were real, scientists would study them. There are a couple reasons scientists don\u2019t study spirits. First, there is no evidence. Science relies on evidence. Without evidence, there is nothing for scientists to investigate. Second, what is a spirit? I have yet to hear an adequate definition of \u201cspirit\u201d. How do you study something if you don\u2019t even know what it is? For Paul Richard, who disabled his comments: Scientists can detect some very subtle energies, far subtler than can be detected by without instrumentation. How do you know those energies exist if you can\u2019t detect them? What is Chi energy? How do you define it? How do you measure it? What equation do you use to calculate it? What are its units of measure? These are basic questions in physics. If you can\u2019t answer these questions, how do you even know you are dealing with energy? After watching the video, I poked around my arm and found the point that causes my hands to twitch. It\u2019s a reflex reaction. No need for mass amounts of undetectable energy. There are a lot of unreal things that cannot be replicated in the laboratory. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe you are asking a sincere question so I want to advise you to find out what science is so you can have the answer to your sincere question. I can\u2019t tell you in a few short sentences what science is except as a very brief summation. Science is practiced by people who are curious about how the world actually works and are highly skeptical of explanations and descriptions of the world for which there is no evidence. When it comes to \u201cspirits\u201d there is no consensus of opinion what that even means, forget about evidence. There is nothing there for a scientist to study; it\u2019s just some stories people enjoy telling. What we should always bear in mind is that we love to be fooled. People go out of their way to be fooled. Whatever political persuasion you happen to belong to, you will regard the opposition as a crowd of fools who love being fooled. We love words and we love being fooled by words. We also love to be fooled by stage magicians; we pay a lot of money to be fooled, we even know that we are going to be fooled as we buy the ticket to get in! We are such fools because we love being fooled, and we love to fool others too. What fun. Not everyone likes being fooled; they are called scientists. ",
