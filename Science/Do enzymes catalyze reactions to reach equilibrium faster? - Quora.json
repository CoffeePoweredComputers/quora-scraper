            "answer_text": "Yes you are right, enzymes catalyze reactions to reach equilibrium faster. Perhaps this did not exactly answer the question asked, or the question was ambiguous and it wasn't the answer he wanted (welcome to academia). The micro/macro equilibrium argument is pretty weak, I suppose he might mean that equilibriums for an enzyme are usually not met in vivo (steady-state equilibrium is rarely met). That argument is meaningless if you are studying enzyme kinetics in vitro, as it is done. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. That\u2019s what any catalyst does: it speeds reaction rates. Left alone, reactions go to equilibrium. Living systems are constantly preventing equilibrium by bringing in new reactants or capturing energy or inactivating enzymes. ",
