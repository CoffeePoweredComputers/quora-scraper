            "answer_text": "Hypergiant stars are so large because they have coalesced in an area of space where there is a great amount of material. The material falls inwards due to gravity accumulating at centers of higher density. If vast areas of this matter do not have too much relative angular motion, a great deal of matter, perhaps hundreds of times the mass of our Sun can coalesce to form a single super massive star. Sometimes, two or more stars will form in close proximity and will collide together forming a larger single star. If the matter clouds contain substantial amounts of elements heavier than hydrogen, this may allow even greater density and therefore mass to accumulate in the star. It won\u2019t be around forever, though, while medium size stars like our Sun can expect a lifespan of billions of years, hypergiants burn through there fusion fuel so rapidly that their life expectancy may be only a few million or in extreme cases, a few hundred thousand years before going super nova. The most massive hypergiant so far observed is R136a1 illustrated below is thought to be about 315 times the mass of our Sun, and puts out more energy in 5 seconds than our Sun does in a year. (left to right: red dwarf, our Sun, blue dwarf, and R136a1 shown partially as background)  ",
