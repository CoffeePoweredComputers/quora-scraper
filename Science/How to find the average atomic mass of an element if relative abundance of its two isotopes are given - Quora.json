            "answer_text": "Take the atomic mass of each isotope and multiply by the fractional abundance of that isotope. Then add them all together to get the average atomic mass. For example, Cl has 2 stable isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. Their masses are resp. 34.96885 and 36.96590 and their abundances are resp. 0.7553 and 0.2447. So (34.96885 x 0.7553) + (36.9659 x 0.2447) = ? (The rest is left as an exercise for the reader). ",

            "answer_text": "The same way you find the average of any numbers. Add them (weighted by their abundance) and divide by the total. Lets say that 98.8% of hydrogen has atomic weight 1, and 1.2% has atomic weight 2. Total mass of 1000 atoms = 988x1 + 12x2 = 1012 1012/1000= 1.012 PS Relative abundances of Hydrogen and Deuterium made up on by me for illustration. The real numbers are different. ",
