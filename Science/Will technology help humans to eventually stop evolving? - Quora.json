            "answer_text": "Technology can remove quite a few selective pressures and thus slow natural selection. For instance, medical technology (especially in the West) has eliminated or minimized quite a few childhood diseases, which was a huge part of natural selection among humans. However, the biggest effect, although indirect, that technology has had in slowing evolution is simply providing resources that allowed our population to get to over 7 billion. Large populations, of any species, only evolve slowly or not at all. This is called \u201cstasis\u201d and is the \u201cstasis\u201d part of Punctuated Equilibrium. Evolution depends on new traits spreading to every member of the species over generations. The larger the population, the more generations this takes. At 7 billion people, even a strongly selected new trait will take over 1 million generations. At 25 years per generation, that is 25 million years. Most evolution occurs in small, geographically isolated populations facing new environments. Here again, technology has slowed the process. This time, it is transportation technology that means that populations are not isolated. There is gene flow between the small populations facing new environments, i.e. the Inuit, the Himalayan highlanders, Pacific islanders, etc. and other populations of humans. ",

            "answer_text": "With technology or without technology evolution is an inherent property of organisms to adapt and to change with respect to ecological and environmental conditions, and is more so with respect to Man. These evolutionary changes are observed over millions of years to time scale and as such that we do not have any idea how to witness, and it is also beyond human capability to be able to think or predict such changes happening over long periods processes involving millions of years.
