            "answer_text": "An easier question to answer is whether a teacher is considered to be a scientist by the scientific community. When scientists think about \u201cscientists\u201d they think about those who head a lab, Principal Investigators, with publishing track records. The term \u201cIndependent Investigator\u201d is important. It means the individual was not just a pair of hands in a lab. So, what do we call a retired Principle Investigator who has devoted himself/herself to teaching, such as Walter White in \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d I guess we call him/her a retired scientist. If a teacher has not had that background, he/she would not be considered a scientist by other scientists. ",

            "answer_text": "Generally not to be a scientist you have to come up with theories and create experiments to find out if it works or not. Chefs are scientist if they are coming up with new dishes. Business people are scientist if they are coming up with new businesses. Designers are if they are coming up with new products. ",
