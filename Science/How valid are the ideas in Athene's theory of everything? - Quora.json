            "answer_text": "I started watching the video, but found it full of inexact statements that at best could have only an inspirational appeal, and couldn\u2019t really be reduced to anything \u201cscientific\u201d. So I stopped due to boredom, and skimmed through this document: http://bin.smwcentral.net/u/16068/athene%2527s%2Btheory%2Bof%2Beverything.pdf I found more of the same stuff there. It\u2019s as if someone skimmed through some bits of neuroscience and physics and then creatively put together a \u201ctheory\u201d on that basis. There are a ton of such theories floating about. You either like them or you don\u2019t. There are bits of science in them, bits of misunderstandings, and a lot of just vague assertions. The document I found mentions Robert Lanza\u2019s Biocentrism. I\u2019ve read Lanza\u2019s book and again I found it too vague to extract much in the way of scientific meaning from. Lanza is clearly not trying to write a textbook, and at one point cites some experience he had while watching a waterfall as practically \u201cproof\u201d to him that his theory is correct. But it\u2019s not clear how we would test his theory or what it would actually concretely imply. Obviously he doesn\u2019t proceed like that when he does his real scientific work. There are lots of \u201cinteresting\u201d theories about the universe around \u2014 I myself have written a whole book on one such hypothesis. Lots of things that sound completely whacky could actually end up being regarded as correct. The problem is in joining the dots, and turning a whacky hypothesis into something that can be verified or refuted scientifically. At the one extreme we have ideas that are even more vague than the material found in this video. At the other extreme we have something like the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, or the decoherence/many worlds intepretation, or string theory, which do a lot of dot-joining but not to the point where they can actually be experimentally tested.

            "answer_text": "I have only watched the video once, so I may have come away with the wrong interpretation.  Nonetheless, the speculation that consciousness is subjective to quantum mechanics, while appealing to some, is largely, well, speculation. Quantum physics affects brains in quite the same way it affects bicycles and amoebas.  The proposition goes thus ''Consciousness arises from brains, brains are matter, matter is subject to quantum rules, thus consciousness is subject to quantum rules''. This doesn't really make sense. It's like saying I am touching my computer, which is touching the internet, which is touching your computer, which is touching you, so in a fashion I am touching you.  Quantum mechanics affects everything, from neurons to door handles to foot sores to monkey hair. Technically speaking, my Intel Core i5 computer is actually a quantum computer. The human body is a quantum device. The brain is also a quantum computer in the same way but that is not really relevant as far as consciousness goes. Can our experience be subject to Quantum rules? Yes, in the sense that, we inhabit a world created on these quantum rules. Everything is subject to quantum effects. But quantum weirdness only applies at the quantum level not at higher levels. Quantum rules effect the molecular level, but after the molecular level quantum effects are negligible and are irrelevant when thinking about higher level processes. We do not need quantum rules to explain how cells interact with one another, how they grow, how they divide and so on. When describing how a car, or a cappuccino machine works you do not really need to know quantum physics. Neuroscience so far has described brain functions pretty well with just molecular mechanics and quantum effects seem negligible for the time being as far as brain mechanics go. Quantum mechanics have no means to affect consciousness, other than the effects it has on the brain, which is really irrelevant when talking about consciousness. ",
