            "answer_text": "Criminology is a science. Because it requires usually logical thinking so henceforth, I would recommend that if you would like to learn more about it, to start by enrolling in a few college classes such as Criminal Law 101, Criminology 100, and Psychology 101. It is a science because if you look at it from a perspective that it asks so many questions about who, what, where and why of the mechanics of what causes crime, who commits it, where is crime committed, and why crime is committed in the first place. There\u2019s a complex set of problems to be solved in the science of criminology. The final solution to be sought is how do we prevent crime from occurring? After many of the former variables are found,only then are we able to come forth and find a much clearer picture. I guess criminology could be considered an art but not as a talking point. It does require years of training especially in the humanities and biological fields, where you must have pre requisite courses in before you can consider graduating in a program which offers it. Those who wish to go into law enforcement would require this training. ",

            "answer_text": "Criminology is most definitely a social science. The peer reviewed literature draws not only on specific theories formulated and tested by criminologists but also on theories from sociology, psychology and biology. To get a sense of the science involved in criminology, look at one of the leading journals i the field, such as Criminology, published by the American Society of Criminology. However, criminology is also actively engaged in issues of public policy where policy often involves strategic compromises: rehabilitation and institutional safety concerns in corrections; the treatment of mental illness (for example) within the court system; public safety and public surveillance in police work. The criminologist as public policy professional, is often concerned with the art of the possible, bringing scientifically supported best practices into the public arena. ",
