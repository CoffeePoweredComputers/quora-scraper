            "answer_text": "First we have to find the total electron pair of carbon, Total electron pair = 1/2[ V+M -C + A] V = total no of valence electron of atom under consideration M= total no. Of monovalent atom. C = total cationic charge. A = total anionic charge. Therefore, for carbon in CO3 2-, Total electron pair = 1/2[4+0\u20130+2] Total electron pair= 3 And for 3 electron pair , there exist \u201c sp2\u201d hybridization. ",
