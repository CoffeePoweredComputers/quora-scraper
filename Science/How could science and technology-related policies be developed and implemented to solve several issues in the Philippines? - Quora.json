            "answer_text": "They can\u2019t solve any problem, until you accept that the fundamental problems the Philippines faces is much more basic and much harder to fix. Science Eduation and more technology simply can\u2019t help a country with no domestic job opportunities for the lower social classes, who have no possibility of upward social mobility no matter how educated they are or how much they are worth financially. For example I have seen poor girls from the provinces manage to get a good private university education, become nurses, go to the US, work for a decade or more, come back to the PInas buy huge farms worth tens of millions of peso, start new businesses in the PInas that are hugely profitable, but at the end of the day still be seen as low class poor provincial women who are no more respectable than their cousin with 13 living kids who had her first kid before she was 13. The biggest problem the philippines suffers from is neither economic nor technical, but rather one that is social and entrenched so deep that even the poor divide themselves into heirarchical social classes.

            "answer_text": "First of all, the government should increase its budget on Education as investment for the development of Science and Technology. Under Duterte\u2019s administration, the budget for Education which forms as basic requirement for advancement in technology is comparatively low accounting only for about 4.17% of the budget. Secondly, it must change its policy from autocratic to a democratic way of solving conflicts like the handling of Manila Water arbitral case in Singapore wherein the president himself declared that he will not honor the ruling of the court contributing to the lost of trust from investors. Such lost in confidence is very evident wherein not a single from hundreds of Multinational leaving China relocated to the Philippines. Other than education, the manufacturing sector is one of the most vital source of a country\u2019s technology as can be seen in the case of China. It is therefore necessary for a country to improve its educational system and research facilities together with an attractive business environment to develop science and technology issues in the Philippines.
