            "answer_text": "Temperature and molecular repulsion tend to separate the molecules, while pressure and molecular attraction tend to confine the molecules. Lets consider water at 1 bar. The standard value of boiling point of water at 1 bar (isobaric heat addition) is 100 degree centigrade. If water is pressurised to a higher pressure, the molecules will be more confined due to increase in pressure. To overcome the confinement and achieve a change of phase, higher kinetic energy will be required. Since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a material, higher kinetic kinetic energy will mean that the substance will have to be heated to a higher temperature.
