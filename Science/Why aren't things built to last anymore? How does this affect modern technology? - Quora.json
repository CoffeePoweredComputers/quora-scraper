            "answer_text": "The manufacturer builds what people want to pay for so I have to ask this question back \u201cWhy do people not want to pay extra for products that will last longer instead of buying low cost throw away items?\u201d Nobody wants to pay extra money for a cell phone that will last over 5 years because they want to change to a better phone with more features every 18 months to three years. Who wants to have phone with lo-resolution camera or with a short battery life? If a manufacturer goes to the expense of using more durable materials and more advanced construction methods on a phone that will last five years it will be overpriced and all those phones will sit on the shelf while a competitor who has used less expensive materials and processes scoops all the customers and those phones fly off the shelf. It\u2019s the same with mobile devices and lap tops. There is no need for it to last more than 5 years. Computer chips, display screens, and all the components that go inside become more powerful and smaller every year. If the market wants to buy phones or computers that last 10 years then manufacturers would be producing them. The consumer is in search of the latest model and that is why there is no desire to have one that will last a lifetime. There is little desire to own or to make such devices. Also, products are designed for assembly which means they are difficult to take apart and it is difficult to replace or repair damaged components. That\u2019s what keeps the price low so that you can afford the latest model. The assembly process is costly and has to be performed in the most efficient manner possible. So if you require goods that are user serviceable and can be dismantled and have the faulty components repaired then you will have to pay more. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is not at all simple. There are many answers & it is not at all clear that things aren\u2019t built to last anymore \u2014 some things are & some things are not. Mass production does not mean lower quality \u2014 it can and at times does result in very superior products vs units made one-at-a-time.  The variability is dependent upon the fundamental business approach of a manufacturer & the quality assurance & quality controls applied at every stage of mass manufacturing. Quality also may depend upon the complexity of the product & the actual role of the product in the market-place. If you take a horse-shoe as an example, the quality variability was immense \u2014 depending on the skill of the Master Smith & his assistants, the ore that the steel was smelted from, the smelting itself, the suitability of the fuel in the forge & whether or not the blacksmith had a flagon of beer before starting out to work.  Compare that to a modern factory that can produce enormously better horse shoes by the millions & each and every one of them indistinguishable from each other in quality & function. If you are only willing to pay the lowest possible price for a product, you had better be prepared for problems.  The consumer is the driver of quality & apparently price is now the only the driver for the consumers\u2019 choice.  There are unscrupulous manufacturers for sure \u2014 but the majority of consumers buy crap anyway.  There are also very good manufacturers of various products & those products are purchased by consumers that know what they are buying & are prepared to pay for the extra cost that it takes to produce a high-quality product. Such products are becoming harder & harder to find. Quality fell when consumers let it fall. ",
