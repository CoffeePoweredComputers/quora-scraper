            "answer_text": "Even complicated subjects (such as organic chemistry) might look easy on the \u201clower\u201d tiers. It is included in some courses, as a prerequisite for other subjects, and you would often see it being refered to as \u201cbasic organic chemistry\u201d or \u201corganic chemistry for the life sciences\u201d, sometimes mockingly so. In the time span of 3\u20136 months, one can only begin to scratch the surface of it all, and some portions of the material will seem easier than others, but only people that have received the full package (like, organic chemists, or biochemists) can testify to whether (and to what extent) organic chemistry is \u201ceasy\u201d.
