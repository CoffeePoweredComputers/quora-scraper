            "answer_text": "Q. How do scientists deal with how society treats their findings? (1) Short answer: Scientists shouldn\u2019t care. (2) Scientists primarily concern themselves with extending the frontiers of science, based on the Scientific method, and the paradigm of science: - Publicity - Repeatability - Test - Peer review - Falsifiability. The Scientific Method, and the paradigm of Science, say nothing about scientists mulling over how society will \u2018treat their findings\u2019, in their modus operandi. This is what scientists are trained to do. This is what scientists do best. (3) Paradigm shift The most compelling science that scientists have to offer is when society at large treat the findings with disbelief, suspicion, ridicule. Copernicus: HeliocentrismDarwinismEinstein: Theory of relativity Paradigm shift: Sam Qwato's answer to Who are some notable philosophers of science? (4) Scientists leave it to society at large to \u2018treat their findings\u2019. The business sector, who monitors the market, will assess their findings for commercial application.The military will assess their findings for military application.Philosophers, social scientists, politicians will ponder their findings on the impact on humanity, e.g. genome, cloning, artificial intelligence, nuclear physics.Other scientists will build upon their findings to make further new discoveries. Science feeds into science.It\u2019s too much to expect of scientists to be also business people, military people, philosophers, sociologists. (5) If a scientist worries excessively about how society will treat his/her discovery, the scientist will not extend the frontiers of science meaningfully. There would\u2019ve been no heliocentrism. No Darwinism. The scientist who discovered electricity could not have envisioned the power and profusion of computers and smartphones we have today. The scientist who invented the computer could not have envisioned the internet. Discover, and society will find uses for it in good time, sometimes, in the most perverse ways: nuclear technology \u2192 WW2 destruction \u2192 Mutual assured destruction (MAD) \u2192 Post-WW2 world peace!
