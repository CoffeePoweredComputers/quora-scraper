            "answer_text": "Are science and religion fundamentally opposed? First, this statement could be construed incorrectly, depending on the learning or worldview of the reader. Are science and religion fundamentally opposed?\u201d is asking an apparently clear question but upon reflection, it is not so clear. To be fundamentally opposed, we might refer to physics There is not much more to science than describing how things are by describing the natural world.The question of how things are is fundamentally different from the questions of why things are.#1 is manageable, doable. We can examine how things are by measurement and observation, based on a standard of comparison for all physical standards (distance, time, mass, etc. ). There is a demand for reproducibility and also a lack of determining what can be falsified. (supernatural claims cannot be falsified) #2 is a question that can be answered. It has been answered from times long before organized religion. The ancient, Pre-Socratic Greeks had their conceptions of why things are, while lacking an ability to distinguish between how things are and why things are for a long period of time Parmenides was one who said that all things are made of water. We see it as ice, water, and clouds (solid, liquid, gas) therefore all things are made of water. This is not a case of asserting \u201cthis is why things are, but HOW things are.\u201d This wasn\u2019t a bad guess considering he lived 5000 years ago. Science describes the natural world or how things are. Science deals with only the natural world which means it cannot deal with supernatural claims or those things which lack evidence as second-hand knowledge that should be believed on faith or feelings. Science and religion are not fundamentally opposed. They don\u2019t even deal with similar questions (HOW things are versus WHY things are). For this reason, there is no debate between science and religion, really, they deal with different questions. IMO, they\u2019re not fundamentally opposed because they both seek answers, but in very different ways. Thanks for reading ",
