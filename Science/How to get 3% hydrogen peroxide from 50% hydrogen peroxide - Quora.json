            "answer_text": "You'd need to dilute it. But, the 50% stuff is expensive and quite dangerous to handle, hard to safely store, decomposes quickly so has limited storage time anyhow, so why are you buying it and turning it into something really cheap? The 3% stuff in my local Walmart usually runs about 79 cents a pint. The 50% stuff can burn you, including your airways if it vaporizes without decomposing, can explode if not stored properly, and quickly turns into oxygen gas and water after being opened. Since it's very expensive, why waste your money on it? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m guessing you are looking for a dilution equation. I tell my students to set up the equation as \u2018What you want\u2019/ \u2018what you have\u2019 X the amount required = the amount of original solution to use to make up the required volume. If you wanted 100 ml of 3% solution, the equation would be 3%/50% X 100ml = 6 ml made up to 100 ml by adding 94 ml water. ",
