            "answer_text": "Let me begin by quoting \"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.\" - Albert Einstein, powerful words from a powerful mind. Obviously what he meant here as 'Religion' is Spirituality (I  like to distinguish between them). Spirituality is a way of critical thinking for revealing the Truth. It is what is called a subjective study - to know a thing by being that thing. Although Science also aims to reveal a certain Truth it works on certain categorical 'principles'-analysis by characterization, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, reproducibility and corroboration. It is a objective study, requiring hard evidence to support claims that become facts. The revelation of certain truths in nature admit to either one of the above mentioned method or to both. For example, to know why an apple from a apple tree falls down on the earth below and not fly away into the sky, one can take up the \"scientific method\"- you do not have to be \"Gravity\" to understand gravity (although you can jump off a tower to get a real feel). But suppose a man begins to question his existence, the cause of his being, the future of his existence, his past existence, the limit to his existence and so on (this is indeed a draw back of possessing high intelligence, questions pop up in the mind) what then? The Scientific Method definitely fails. How to characterise his existence for he is unique, one and only in this world, so the subsequent pillars of science, hypothesis, prediction, experimentation, reproducibility and corroboration, all fail. Does that mean to ask such a question is wrong. Some might dismiss these questions but to the overly curious fellow they are pertinent. So he thinks on and on, pondering over the possible answers. Engaged in his quest he devotes less time for worldly activities  and more to finding the answer. He withdraws himself from the world and contemplates on the answers, meditating. He become as The Bhagawat Gita puts it, \"a introspective sage.\" This is the Spiritual Method. But did he have an answer to his question. You can not possibly know. He knows it!. Its like to paraphrase the anecdote that Sri Paramhansha Ramakrishna would say. Suppose a doll made of salt in its quest to know the taste of the sea goes to the sea shore and has a dip. Could you tell that the doll was successful in its undertaking?The answer lies with the investigator. He can at most share his experiences with you, advice you but there is no hard evidence to support his claim. To understand the answer you must admit yourself to the same process as he did. Obviously most 'scientists' withdraw themselves from wordy activities to uncover 'scientific' facts (one can read the numerous stories of scientists goofing up in household tasks), but they are looking for hard evidences. Extending the above anecdote, the scientist would collect samples from different seas, bring it back to his laboratory, try to chemically analyse the water, with the result would formulate a hypothesis, predict the results for other sample, then taste it himself, have others taste it and conclude that the water containing NaCl, is salty. He would then get this verified from other scientists as well. Doing all this without the botheration of a delectable dinner. He does not stop there. Suppose one of his collogues sent him the results of a further study that he had done on the harmful effects on excess salt in humans with which he goes on to build a \"salt bomb\" that could end civilizations when unleashed in water supply. Suddenly what began as a simple taste experiment evolves in a evil proposal.So you see without spirituality science is lame. Similarly, if a \"religious\" man with the evidence at hand refuse to accept that the sea water is salty due to NaCl only because his Holy Scripture says its due to MgCl, then he is blind. But to the introspective sage it is clear.This is where Science and Religion meet (or must meet), Spirituality. Science and Religion must be supplementary to one another. One providing for the deficiencies of the other although being complimentary. The following figure should be self explanatory.  ",

            "answer_text": "Mankind was born with the innate desire to organize and understand his environment.  The invention of religion was mankind's first attempt at accomplishing this.  In the initial absence of the scientific method (as we understand it today), great religious theologies were first created in order to explain what had previously been inexplicable.  Later, once more well-informed explanations for such things became available, the less-informed \"religious theologies\" which had previously explained these phenomenon, were easily and readily discarded by most. Unfortunately, some people remained who preferred to cling to the earlier \"theological explanations\" for things, and to claim that their personal preferences were somehow, \"divinely inspired and therefore superior to,\" the more well-informed, and more scientific explanations that had later developed. Currently, the only remaining preserves of what might be termed as \"the still unsolved mysteries of existence\" lie mostly in the realms beyond time and space, and beyond life and death.  The modern scientific method, by default and by its own definition, deals only with time and space, and only with quantifiable events, actions, and reactions, that appear to take place within the realm of what we might call, the \"land of the living\". While the boundaries of these remaining \"preserves of the scientifically unknowable\", seem to be generally respected by many scientists, there yet remain other scientists who appear to be making the claim that no such preserves exist wherein the modern scientific method has not yet, and never will be able to, readily and easily assist us in unraveling the secrets of these still seemingly inaccessible realms of knowledge. To summarize: Modern day religion/spirituality, once properly divested of its old and outdated anachronistic-theo-pseudo-sciences of the past, still retains a sort of a monopoly over the \"realms beyond time and space, and beyond life and death.\"  Science now rightfully maintains a certain sort of a monopoly over the realm of time and space, and of apparent life.
