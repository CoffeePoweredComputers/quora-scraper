Cyber Security is the demand of the day, most of the people working in Information Technology Industry are not aware of the concepts of making the digital devices (Laptops, Mobile phones, Tablets etc) secured from the cyber attack. Due to Cyber attacks and malfunctioning of the devices more and more data is being stolen by cyber hackers every year. CSC has taken the responsibility of spreading the awareness about cyber security and to educate the people about it.  Why Should We Learn Cyber Security? Six Reseon:Cyber security demands focus and dedication. Cyber security protects the data and integrity of computing assets belonging to or connecting to an organization's network. ... Cyber security experts need a stronger understanding of these topics and many others, to be able to confront those challenges more effectively.In the 1860s, Horace Greeley, founder and editor of The New York Tribune, inspired a generation of young Americans by popularizing the phrase, \u201cGo West, young man, and grow up with the country.\u201d In the 1960s, the Oscar-winning movie \u201cThe Graduate\u201d offered some tongue-in-cheek inspiration of its own when an older man takes aside recent college graduate Benjamin Braddock and says, \u201cI just want to say one word to you. Just one word. Are you listening? Plastics.\u201d In the 2010s, the vocational advice for young professionals could very well be, \u201cConsider a career in cybersecurity.\u201d The following are six reasons why. 1. High DemandAccording to Bloomberg Businessweek, the U.S. Department of Defense and the FBI alone would like to recruit 6,000 people with cybersecurity skills by the end of 2016. The technology tsunamis that are transforming society in so many positive ways are also making it more vulnerable to attacks on the privacy of data, the integrity of payment systems and the availability of critical infrastructure. Technology alone is not enough to prevent, detect, respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents; there is also a critical need for skilled people. Depending on the source, the unemployment rate for cybersecurity professionals is currently near or below zero. The point is, demand is high and exceeds supply. 2. High PayHigh demand does not always mean high pay (e.g., teachers), and high pay does not always mean plentiful opportunities (e.g., Major League shortstops). However, in the case of cybersecurity, both demand and compensation are up, as the average income reported by cybersecurity professionals in the United States is three times the national median for full-time workers. Money is not always at the top of the list for why people are motivated to go to work every day, but it\u2019s usually up there, and higher pay doesn\u2019t hurt. 3. Highly SkilledWhen something is so easy that anyone can do it, one can\u2019t expect high demand and high pay to be sustained; however, this is not the case for cybersecurity professionals. In 2012, an article in the Harvard Business Review referred to data scientists \u2014 that is, the people who can coax valuable insights out of a messy, complex collection of data \u2014 as \u201cThe Sexiest Job of the 21st Century.\u201d Technical skills can be taught, but a natural capacity for conceptualizing, synthesizing and solving problems is unique and special \u2014 and apparently sexy, for some people. Cybersecurity is interesting, challenging, technology-focused work. 4. Highly DynamicBecause information technology is in a constant state of change \u2014 thank you, Moore\u2019s Law \u2014 so is cybersecurity. The latest college graduates may have grown up as \u201cdigital natives,\u201d but keep in mind that at the time they were preparing to graduate from high school, no one had iPads. The fascinating battle between the technology makers and the technology breakers goes back hundreds of years, but the faster technology changes, the faster attackers can exploit it. From denial-of-service attacks, point-of-sale intrusions, attacks on Web apps and abuse by insiders to ransomware, cyber-extortion, malicious QR codes and malevolent fonts, if you\u2019re looking for work that is repetitive and boring, a career in cybersecurity is certainly not for you. 5. Highly TransferableMany jobs are tied to specific locations, but a career in cybersecurity is highly portable \u2014 after all, we are in an information economy. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that these jobs are located in virtually every geography, and it goes without saying that these types of jobs can be located virtually anywhere. In other words, wherever there is a network connection, you can be on the job (though there\u2019s both an upside and a downside to that). 6. Higher PurposeAs a rule, cybersecurity professionals are not likely to be famous. On the contrary, they quietly provide committed, faithful and honorable service to their organizations, countries and society as a whole. What\u2019s under constant attack is more than just our networks, devices, servers, applications and data; it\u2019s also our mobile, flexible, connected way of life. Very much like the thin blue line of law enforcement or the thin red line of firefighters, the thin digital line of cybersecurity professionals will increasingly be recognized and appreciated as an important and meaningful vocation ",
