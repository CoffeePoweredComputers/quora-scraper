            "answer_text": "The hot topic for a Ph.D. is the one for which you have a great deal of passion, and one that will sustain that passion beyond your Ph.D.. The subject matter may be something that you or someone close to you may have experienced personally. I completed my dissertation in 1990 and I am still very intrigued about the subjective experience of Alzheimer\u2019s disease! My Mom was diagnosed with it at the age of 80 and it was the cause of her death at the age of 93. Having chaired many dissertations, the \u201chot topics\u201d were always the ones that the student was personally invested in and often became the foundation for his or her career. I have led Alzheimer\u2019s Support Groups for 25 years & have evaluated many patients with dementia. Let me share with you a few other \u201chot topics\u201d which have become the basis of colleagues\u2019 careers. \u201cA Phenomenological Study of Early Stage Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Patients\u201d Lawrence J. Schulte, Ph.D. The Use of Service Dogs in Graduate School and in Organizational Settings. Maximizing Peak Performance in Professional Cyclists Racing. The Use of Hypnotherapy as Anesthesia and Pain Management. My colleague Dr. Eric Yelsa was Associate Professor at the University of Utah Medical Center where he was a member of the Department of Anesthesiology & taught hypnotherapy to medical residents for pain management. \u201cEnergy Balance Components and Body Fat in Prostate Cancer Survivors\u201d Jackie Kiwata Dawson, Ph.D. Go inside and ask yourself one simple question: \u201cWhat is the one thing that really intrigues me about ??? and will I want to continue to study it ten years from now?\u201d Good luck!

To me, it just seems like a really odd thing to do, because if you are going to find the motivation to write a dissertation, the topic needs be something that personally interests you, not some people on the internet who have never met you. I\u2019m really curious what all these people are thinking, particularly what they think the PhD is supposed to be. I imagine this inquiry could find a place in some social science discipline. ",

It depends who you ask, and what precisely you mean by hot, etc. However, these are not ordinary times. It seems clear that machine learning is the hottest research topic. It just is. It's such a hot topic it's kind of ridiculous. However, by the time you finish your PhD the hot topic might be something else. ",

Then, I would need to know something of your interest, your focus, whether it was related to physical sciences or sociology, business or economics, and so on. Even if you could narrow it down to a discipline, such as environmental engineering it would be helpful. The best advice I received in selecting my dissertation topic was to pick something that I had a passion about, since it would consume most of my waking hours (and a lot of dream time) until I completed it. Upon completion, I would be considered an expert, so the dissertation would follow me around the rest of my life, too. So, the best idea is to first figure out what you\u2019re studying. ",
