            "answer_text": "4 moles of NH3 reacts with 5 moles of O2. So 7.5 moles of NH3 is supposed to react with 9.375 moles of O2. But only 8.2 moles of oxygen is taken. so O2 is limiting reagent, which consumes completely. So the product will be formed with respect to O2 only. So 5 moles of O2 produce\u2026.6 moles H2O. 8.2 moles of O2 produce\u2026..? No of moles of H2O forrmed=(8.2\u00d76)/5= 9.84 moles ",
