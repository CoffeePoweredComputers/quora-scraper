            "answer_text": "It depends on what \u201caren\u2019t there anymore\u201d means, and the distance you\u2019re looking. I\u2019ll answer both senses of the question: the star has moved away from where it appears to be from Earth, and the star has \u201cdied\u201d. As a rule, individual stars are moving quite quickly relative to the Earth, and whole galaxies are moving extremely fast. The Earth itself may also be moving fast relative to other stars and galaxies\u2026 If you\u2019re looking at stars that are relatively nearby, they haven\u2019t moved all that much in the few years or few dozen years it takes for their light to reach the Earth.If you\u2019re looking at stars that are thousands of light-years away, they may have moved quite a distance from where they appear from Earth.If you\u2019re looking at millions of light years, ie in other galaxies, the whole galaxy will have moved a significant distance.Once you get to billions of light-years of distance, a whole lot of stars will have \u201cdied\u201d. Yellow and red dwarf stars (our Sun is a yellow dwarf) may not have died in large numbers, but bigger stars mostly will have gone nova or supernova. Some stars will have gone nova and stellar remnants may remain, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes.As a rule, the bigger the star, the shorter its lifespan. Really big stars - the ones we can see from a great distance - are more likely to have blown up even in a few hundred thousand years than small stars, which can burn relatively quietly for billions of years: Stellar evolution. Red dwarf stars are the most numerous and the longest-lived of the more common types of stars, but they\u2019re also the hardest to see as they don\u2019t put out much light. As for the second part of the question, new stars can certainly have moved into the same position as a star we saw from a great distance. And a big star that blows up often creates a Stellar nursery nebula that can form other (smaller) stars and planetary systems, so if we see a supergiant star that\u2019s a billion light years away, it\u2019s almost certainly blown up and replaced by other stars by the time its light reaches Earth.

            "answer_text": "Neither it isn't true, nor it is. The fact is that the stars we observe in the night sky are within our very own galaxy, and that too in a certain region of a couple thousand light years. The farthest thing visible to the naked eye is a star in Cassiopeia at a distance of 4000 light years. That means the light that we see today left its star 4000 years ago. So in this four thousand years the star have moved a bit, but since distances in the cosmic scale change very little in a span of a few thousand years. Maybe after half a million years that star won't be there anymore, meaning it would have moved from its place. But it won't go supernova or form a black hole or just die off and stop \u201cbeing there\u201d. And since all stars of the night sky are within a distance of something less than 10,000 light years. So they are pretty much alive and kicking. Now if you are looking through the billion dollar Hubble Telescope then an interesting thing happens. Suppose you look at a star in some other galaxy at a distance of a 10 billion light years. So the light has been travelling for 10 billion years, far old than our solar system which formed just 5 billion years ago. Certain stars donot live for 10 billion years, and stars like our sun are likely to be waiting for supernova explosion and go kaboom! So yes, extremely farther objects that we are observing today maynot exist anymore. ",
