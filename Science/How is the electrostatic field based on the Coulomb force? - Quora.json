            "answer_text": "Coulomb force (generally called electrostatic force) is proportional to the product of two \u201cpoint-like\u201d electric charges, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance separating the charges. Since charge can be positive or negative, the product can be positive (repulsive force) or negative (attractive force). When I say \u201cpoint-like\u201d I mean that each charge may be the sum of charges on particles clustered around the point representing the weighted center of charge. For example, if a bunch of charged particles are uniformly clustered in or on a sphere, the total charge is the sum of all particle charges and the center of charge is the center of the sphere. Force calculation is valid only outside the cluster. When we speak of the separation distance, we mean the distance between the charge centers. Before we go to the electric field, I want to point out that electrostatic force is very similar to gravity force. Charge is analogous to mass. Mass can be clustered. There is a center to clusters of charge and mass. Separation distance is measured between cluster centers, and forces obey inverse-square distance law, only outside clusters. Forces are proportional to universal constants independent of everything. The only fundamental difference is that gravity is always attractive. Now, the definition of an electric field is that at some arbitrary distance R from a constant charge Q, the field\u2019s value is the work required to bring a unit charge to that point from infinitely far away, through the force it shares with Q. It is the integral of Q\u2019s electrostatic force on a unit charge times increments of separation distance, over the range from infinity (where force is zero) to R. That\u2019s exactly how we describe the field of gravity around a mass M; we integrate M\u2019s gravitational force on a unit mass times increments of separation distance, over the range from infinity (where force is zero) to R.

            "answer_text": "A2A: The term \u201celectrostatic field\u201d is the term we use to describe the region around an electric charge that exhibits the effect called the Coulomb Force. The \u2018\u2019field\u2019 is the \u2018thing\u2019 that appears to fill space and gives rise to the Coulomb Force. It is comparable to the magnetic field around a magnet.
