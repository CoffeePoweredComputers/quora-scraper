            "answer_text": "No Christopher, the beauty of fundamental forces is that they are truly fundamental. They do not break down, not ever, but one fundamental forces can always be stronger than the other. Gravity gets stronger when distances between hadrons decrease. In the case of the strong force, which is a lot stronger than gravity at these short distances, it gets exponentially stronger repulsive when distances between quarks decrease. So the super strong repulsive strong force prevents black holes to collapse into singularities. ",

            "answer_text": "No of course not. Black holes are simply so massive that they curve space drastically, so that things which pass a certain radius can\u2019t turn back. They\u2019re an extreme manifestation of gravity, but gravity acts on everything the same way. In detail: The strong force keeps the nucleus together. I suppose in theory, a nucleus could be right on the edge of a black hole horizon, but there would be no reason for one part of it to go in and the other to stay out. Gravity affects every kind of charge, so it would affect all parts of the nucleus pretty much the same, and if the nucleus slipped past the black hole radius, it would just have to keep going in all the way to the center.

            "answer_text": "First, force is not energy. Second, I don\u2019t even know what it would mean to \u201cbreak down\u201d a fundamental force. What would it mean to \u201cbreak down\u201d electromagnetism, or gravity? Anyway, according to general relativity, all forms of energy just go into the curling up of spacetime at the \u201csingularity\u201d of a black hole. Nobody thinks this what actually happens, because infinities don\u2019t make sense and general relativity is a classical theory inconsistent with quantum mechanics. So on a macroscopic level we\u2019re sure that nuclear binding energies just contribute to the curvature of spacetime like any other energy, but what happens exactly to these fields at the center of black hole we don\u2019t know.
