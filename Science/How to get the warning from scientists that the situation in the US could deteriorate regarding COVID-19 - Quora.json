            "answer_text": "Just face up to reality. The reality is no different in the US than it is in, say, France. A confirmed case is not a death or even a serious illness. In the absence of a vaccine, any person-to-person virus will spread indefinitely until sufficient people become immune that it can\u2019t \u201cfind\u201d anymore susceptible hosts.
