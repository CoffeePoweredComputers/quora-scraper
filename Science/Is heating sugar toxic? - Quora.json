            "answer_text": "If you have a breathing disorder and you heat sugar to the point where it oxidises, you may find that it causes a problem for you, but that\u2019s the same with most things if you burn them. Caramel is made by heating refined sugar to the point where it changes colour from the original white through golden to the colour you are looking for. At some point, it will turn dark brown, almost black and may burn. Burnt sugar is used in some cooking styles, including Jamaican. It also used to be used as gravy browning some 50 years and more ago. So far as I know there is no additional toxicity from sugar when heated, though if it burns it may become more toxic, as burnt food has recently been found to be worse for you than was previously understood.

            "answer_text": "If sugar ( table sugar) is heated, at about 160 C it will be oxidized to form several oxidized compound and change to light to very dark brown color with distinct flavor. This process is called carmelization. Caramel for its flavor is used in many preparation, like sweets, chocolates, in some cooking, etc. In this form and in the amount consumed, it has not been linked to any toxicity. However, if it is consumed in large amounts, like everything , it can produce bad effect. But that is not for its toxic effect, but because by cosuming too much you have caused it to become toxic ( too much of anything is bad). ",
