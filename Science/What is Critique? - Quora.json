            "answer_text": "When I think of critique, what comes to mind is identifying pros and cons, strengths and weaknesses of the particular issue. An excellent example is a well-written book review on a non-fiction topic. The review will lay out the basic issue so someone unfamiliar with the topic will understand the outline. It will give examples of what the author's thesis is and how this contributes to the body of knowledge for this particular topic. Finally, it will point out shortcomings of the book. These may be related to biases the author has shown, or overlooking or misinterpreting (according to the review author) information, or not drawing clear enough links in presenting the information to help the reader. To write a quality review or any similar analysis requires critical thinking. Is the author being intellectually honest? Intellectually curious? Does the author show intellectual humility? Engage in socio-centric thinking? Although the skills needed for valuable critique are broadly applicable, the body of knowledge needed for particular fields is specific. Thanks for the A2A. ",

            "answer_text": "Critical Thinking is a strategy, which can be used for various purposes, such as solving a problem, getting a correct answer or \"winning\" a Debate.  Debate at one time elevated itself with the mantle of Truth but is now more often found consorting with Persuasion. Critique is to participate in a discourse that involves inquiry, with the intention of exploring the limits of and/or improving something.
