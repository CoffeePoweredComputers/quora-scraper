            "answer_text": "None. Seriously. None. Having spent a fair chunk of my formative years in Queensland nursing a burning (and unfullfilled) ambition to be a zoologist, I am well aware of the ecoogical disaster that is the cane toad in Australia. And pretty near every other introduced species. So, that said, why not introduce one of the cane toad\u2019s natural predators? The first reason ties in with the main reason to follow: there are already native species that fill the ecological niche of the cane toad\u2019s South American predators. There are various indigenous insects, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals capable of preying on the cane toad at various stages of its life cycle. This in spite of the toxic skin. The issue would appear to be a matter of numbers and distribution of those predators not aligning with that of the cane toad. With the first point out of the way, we get to the main reason: any species introduced to prey on the cane toad will create similar ecological havoc. To explain that a little more fully\u2026 Cane toads were introduced to prey on the grey-backed cane beetle - an insect that caused its own havoc on sugar cane crops. Some research was done to find the best way to combat said bug, during which the role of the similar insects in the cane toad\u2019s diet came to light. Ideas got batted around and hey, presto, surprise surprise, it is decided to bring some cane toads to Australia as a natural solution to the problem. Turned out that the cane toad wasn't such a fan of said beetle, but instead found lots and lots of other thing more than a tad tasty and tempting. Added to that, as a newcomer to the landscape it had no natural predators - or at least none that were quick to twig that these ugly nasty tasting amphibians were, taste aside, edible. And they bred like mad. And generally, outcompeted the hell out of native species for resources. Essentially, any predator species introduced to combat the cane toad will follow the same trajectory with the same ecological results, just one step higher up the food chain. Besides, as one of the main predators of the adult cane toad is a snake, and Australia has already pretty much cornered the market on venemous snakes, it'd be just greedy to add another species to the list.

            "answer_text": "There is actually several types of animals that eat a cane toad in it's natural habitat. Cane toad - Wikipedia They including the broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris), the banded cat-eyed snake (Leptodeira annulata), eels (family Anguillidae), various species of killifish, the rock flagtail (Kuhlia rupestris), some species of catfish (order Siluriformes), some species of ibis (subfamily Threskiornithinae), and Paraponera clavata (bullet ants). Unfortunately, many wouldn't survive well in Australia, they wouldn't target just the cane toads, and many of them would be just as dangerous as the cane toads. Predators outside the cane toad's native range include the whistling kite (Haliastur sphenurus), the rakali (Hydromys chrysogaster), the black rat (Rattus rattus) and the water monitor (Varanus salvator). Many of them are just as bad to the environment and natural species of Australia as the cane toad! New Zealand already knows the problems with the black rat! Opossums of the Didelphis genus likely can eat cane toads with impunity. Meat ants are unaffected by the cane toads' toxins, and therefore are able to kill them. The cane toad's normal response to attack is to stand still and let its toxin kill the attacker, which allows the ants to attack and eat the toad. Two of the biggest killers of came toads are types of ants, bullet ants and meat ants. Meat ants are already native to Australia, in fact the dominant ant species in Australia! You don't want to put anything there to compete with them. Bullet ants get their name because their sting feels like being shot! ",
