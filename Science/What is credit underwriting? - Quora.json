            "answer_text": "Credit risk analysis is thus the assessing of the possibility of the failure of borrower\u2019s repayment and the loss caused to the financer when the borrower does not for any reason repay the contractual loan obligations. Interest for credit-risk assumption forms the earnings and rewards from such debt-obligations and risks. Underwriting risks are hence loss and risks borne by the underwriter, financer or person offering contractual obligations. For example, inaccurate risk analysis in an insurance policy could cause the premium amounts to fall short of the paid amount when uncontrollable insured events occur. Similarly, the security industry underwriters hold part of the stock or sell at less when unfavourable market conditions hit the issue of the underwritten stocks. Underwriting Credit Risks Underwriting credit risk is the crux of the investment banks and insurers business. Credit risks and credit underwriting also include contractual obligations besides loans and financing monetarily. In contracts of insurance, the insurer has an obligation to pay for damages under the policy perils covered on acceptance of the premium amount. Here underwriting would mean the creation of the policies, its terms and contractual obligations. New policies generate the premiums which are invested for profit by the insurers against the obligation to pay for damages to the insured, in case of the occurrence of unforeseen eventualities. Thus the premiums charged or interest accrued is the primary underwriting concern. Credit risk management, analysis, and mitigation are hence the pillars of underwriting and profitability. ",
