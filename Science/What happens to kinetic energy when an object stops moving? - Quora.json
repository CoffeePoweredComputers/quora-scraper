            "answer_text": "gernerally speaking kinetic energy changes into other form of energy like a ball thrown on the terrace of a building aquires potential energy which is converted from kinetic energy that was initially into the ball at the moment of throw.when a ball or a projectile collides with any obstruction the kinetice energy divides into several parts like sound energy, heat energy and various other some part of the kinetic energy is also spent in overcoming resistance like air drag,friction.3 so we can say that when an object stops moving it\u2019s kinetic energy changes into other form of energy but never gets destroyed.",

            "answer_text": "It gets converted into other forms of energy depending on the situation. If a ball is stopped due to collision, it is converted into heat, sound, and sometimes light. A ball moving upwards stops because its kinetic energy is converted into gravitation potential energy. ",
