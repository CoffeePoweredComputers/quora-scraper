            "answer_text": "Yes. When ultrasonics are applied to a fluid (i.e. air, water), there are many physical effects which can be applied to the destruction of microorganisms. The physical effects that can be applied to this purpose are: Radiation pressureAcoustic streamingCavitationAn example of killing microorganisms through the use of radiation pressure from ultrasonics (in air), can be read about here: Ultrasound potentially safe, effective way to kill bacteria | Penn State University Essentially, bacteria was placed in an envelope and held in air above an ultrasonic source. The radiation pressure created in the air was sufficient to kill the bacteria. Acoustic streaming can be used to deagglomerate microorganisms, which weakens them so that they can be killed easier by other chemicals. I know a researcher who is currently assessing the effectiveness of ultrasonic equipment which is currently being marketed to kill algae in ponds, using this acoustic streaming method. A key point to evaluate is the effective distance over which this effect can occur, and whether there are any negative side effects. Cavitation is the creation of high pressure microbubbles which can be used to directly kill bacteria in liquids. When these bubbles collapse extremely high temperatures are created locally which destroy microorganisms. Here is a good overview of this process: Pearson - Science News Interestingly, there has also been research that suggests that ultrasound can be used to increase the growth of bacteria, the opposite of killing it: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361254/ ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it can. Sound can disturb or even destroy a body by matching its frequency against the body self resonant frequency. As we are acknowledged, every body / matter has self resonant frequency, at which frequency, the body will be effortlessly resonated. A self resonant frequency of a body is determined by; what materials build the body, the shape of the body, the surface of the body, and its structure (whether solid or perforated or porous). Once the frequency of the sound matches the body resonant frequency, it\u2019s just the matter of \u201ctime\u201d (the duration of the body exposed to that particular sound) and the \u201camplitude\u201d (the power of the sound), the sound will \u201ctear the body apart\u201d. Extreme example; you can destroy a bridge with sound, or a building if you know the self resonant frequency of the bridge or the building. Inline with that, microorganisms also can be \u201cteared apart\u201d or \u201cdestroy\u201d by a sound with certain proper frequency. This can analogically be applied to \u201cdestroy\u201d tumor or some wild growth cells in our body as well. Jokingly, you can also melt someone\u2019s heart, if you know her/his heart self resonant frequency :) But there is no formulation to find the resonant frequency of a body / thing. It can only be found empirically. ",
