You\u2019ve cooked a few roasts and baked a few loaves in your time, so you know your way around a Dutch oven and a Silpat (if you have to ask, then you definitely need this list). Your bookshelf has a dedicated cookbook section, plus several of your favorite recipe websites are bookmarked and apps downloaded. Well, we\u2019ve got the Holy Grail. *Cue angelic singing, parting clouds, and beams of light.* OK, maybe these kitchen hacks won\u2019t change your life in an \u201cI won the lottery\u201d or \u201cI just found out I\u2019m pregnant\u201d kind of way. And maybe you\u2019ve seen a few of these before. But we\u2019ve mixed it up a bit and covered a lot of territory here \u2014 from pimping out your refrigerator to the easiest four-ingredient ice cream you\u2019ll ever make (no cooking or fancy gizmos required). 1. Make Eggs in the Microwave Are you sick of eating a mediocre AM meal of bland yogurt at work every morning? Meet your new office best friend: the microwave. Find out how to make a breakfast-of-champions in just a few simple steps, plus the help of minimal equipment (a microwaveable plate or bowl). In under 5 minutes you can make scrambled eggs, or even fried eggs (hello desk-side huevos rancheros!), in the time that it would take you to order that overpriced cup of oatmeal. Your work day is about to get a whole lot better. 2. Section ground meat before freezing  100waystopreparehamburger.blogspot.com You can break off as much as you need without defrosting the whole package. 3. Reuse pickle brine  The Kitchn Drop chip-size slices of fresh cucumber into leftover pickle brine in the jar and store in the refrigerator for a few days to make crunchy quick pickles. (You can also drop in other vegetables like green beans, garlic, carrots or radishes. For best results, par-boil these veggies before pickling to speed up the process.) 4. Wet your fingers to remove eggshell Lifehack - Help, Tips and Guidance to improve all aspects of your life Stray shell bits in your cracked egg? Dab your finger in water before you go after it. Water acts like a magnet and the shell will stick to your finger without having to chase it around the bowl. 5. Make limp celery crisp again  feedyourskull.com Trim the top and bottom of the celery (cut it off of the root if it is still attached) and drop the stalks upright into a pitcher or jar of ice-cold water to re-crisp. You can also store celery like this. The ice water trick also works on tired broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, lettuce, and spinach. 6. Makin\u2019 crispy bacon without the mess America's Test Kitchen Forget about the cast iron skill. Line a baking sheet with heavy-duty aluminum foil (or two layers of foil) that has been crimped at 1-inch intervals to create a disposable bacon rack. Elevating the bacon keeps it out of the grease and allows hot air to circulate around the bacon, so it cooks and crisps evenly. 7. Use an egg slicer to slice mushrooms (or strawberries)  cookthink.com 8. Use your Microplane grater on burnt bits self.com If the bottom of your cookies got a wee bit scorched, brush the grater over the burnt side to buff away the evidence. 9. \u201cDot\u201d your butter \u2026 better  barefeetinthekitchen.com When a recipe calls for \u201cdotting\u201d with butter, such as a fruit crisp or a breadcrumb-covered casserole (it adds richness and helps browning), grate chilled butter on the large holes of a flat grater to create uniform pieces that are easier to distribute. Just some cool food hacks I found, definitely try them out! ",

            "answer_text": "These are a little more cooking and prep related food hacks, but they are tried-and-true! Bacon - Cut your bacon strips in half before cooking them. It fits way better in the pan.Ginger Root - If you cook with ginger, try peeling it with a spoon. Use the concave edge of the spoon to scrape the skin off the flesh - it will save a lot of the ginger goodness as opposed to using a knife.Garlic - Peel garlic cloves by laying your knife sideways on top of one, and lightly pounding it with a side-fist. This will crack the peel right down to the good part, making it simple to peel off in one piece.Hard-Boiled Eggs - Bring your water to a boil, gently drop in the eggs, set your timer for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, moved your eggs into a bowl of cold water and let sit for 2 minutes. They will be perfectly cooked, and easily peelable.Boiling Water - A dash of salt will bring your water to a boil quicker.Spices - When cooking with dry, powdered spices, heat will bring out the flavours. Try adding them to a hot, oiled pan before you add the rest of your ingredients for much richer flavours.Coconut Oil - Coconut oil has so many uses, it\u2019s a true kitchen staple. Use in place of butter (1:1) in baking, cook with it, eat it on toast with sugar and cinnamon.",

This is super annoying, so what do you do? Usually you just pop it in the microwave but the issue with this is it always seems to over melt the butter and make it into a big soupy mess just like this. That can be very annoying so there must be a better way. Well there is, take a cheese grater and then you just grate your butter stick. Yes that\u2019s right, grate your butter stick. Now that has two added benefits, one it delivers energy to the butter by the grating motion which makes it a bit softer, and also the higher surface area makes it softer quicker also. Lastly it\u2019s in this funny interesting spaghetti like consistency which now is super spreadable so you can just spread it on whatever you want and you have nice soft butter.
