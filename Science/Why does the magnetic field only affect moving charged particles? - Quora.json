            "answer_text": "It's basically because of special relativity. An object acquires less space while it's moving than in rest. This is a fundamental property of our nature. So, now assume a conductor having flow of electron. The conductor is neutral, so it will have zero effect on a test charge resting near it. Now, if the charge is moving then in the frame of reference of charge, electrons are slowing down and protons are accelerating. So, for the test charge the space acquired by the electron is increasing and this space increases the net density of protons. This results that the test charge faces a repulsive force from the positive charge. But it seems that the charge must not be deflected in our frame of reference. So magnetism is electric force but from another frame of reference.  ",

            "answer_text": "Simply put, the magnetic field is due to the influence of moving charges. [Note: this isn't rigorous]. If you are outside a wire with current, the first thing you do is boost to the rest frame of the moving electron and realize that there's a net contraction effect in this frame where the wire now carries negative charge, which is an electrostatic force acting on outside particles. The observer outside the wire will not agree on the cause of the force like the observer sitting on the electrons in the wire. Note that the charge on the outside is moving in the rest frame of the current in the wire. ",
