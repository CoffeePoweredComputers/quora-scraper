            "answer_text": "Setting aside the text question, which has been answered Planck\u2019s number of times on Quora including Is there anything smaller than a Planck length?, there\u2019s an interesting question in the details. Drop an object to earth and the earth does respond by more than a Planck length. Drop a 1 kg weight from 1 meter, and the earth comes to meet it by about a yoctometer, 10^-24 meters. That\u2019s a trillion times larger than a Planck length, 10^-35 meters. That isn\u2019t actually meaningful. The Earth isn\u2019t moving in Planck lengths. You can\u2019t see it not because of anything quantum but because we don\u2019t have measuring sticks capable of measuring that small a change (percentage-wise). And the earth is neither rigid nor uniform, so the actual motion is much more complicated. But just as a matter of magnitudes, even the earth moving towards a small object is still considerably larger than a Planck length. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Photons, electrons, neutrinos, and individual quarks are POINT sized, smaller than Planck dimensions. So clearly, this is \u201cphysically meaningful\u201d, or at least \u201csize scale\u201d is NOT fundamental in Nature. Which is why you can have Universal expansion without breaking physics. [1610.00012] Cosmic Inflation from Emergent Spacetime Picture \u201cWhen something very small falls to the ground, the Earth also moves slightly upwards, but that would be a distance smaller than Planck length. Could this really be happening?\u201d Sure, but ultimately that doesn\u2019t matter. There is no spacetime (or size, or speed) in the quantum realm. Our Universe is constructed on / over / using the quantum realm as a sort of underlayment (like a roadbed), and size is an emergent property. Which means Planck units have always been, and will always be, failed Dimensional analysis - Wikipedia. Not some sort of numerology with secret meaning for its cabal. ",
