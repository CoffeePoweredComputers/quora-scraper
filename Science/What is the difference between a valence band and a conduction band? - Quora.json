            "answer_text": "You asked the difference between the conduction and valence bands, but I'll go ahead and answer the more interesting question-\" What are the conduction and valence bands and why are they formed\". The answer to your question will be self-explanatory once you understand what they are.I'd like to answer this question from a quantum mechanical viewpoint.When you have bonding between 2 atoms, the wavefunctions of the molecule (formed by the 2 separate atomic states) must be antisymmetric. This will guarentee that no two electrons occupy the same state simultaneously, thus upholding Pauli's Exclusion Principle. The condition of anti-symmetry is true for fermions, like electrons, neutrons. For bosons- like photons, pions, alpha particles, etc, the wave functions must be symmetric. This wavefunction \u03a8 is a product of 2 independent components- a positional component \u03c8, and a spin component \u03c7s.If the spins are parallel (\u03c7s->symmetric), you get a low energy state, with a finite probability of occupation near the middle, and this is called a singlet state, and is a bonding orbital (BO).If \u03c8 is asymmetric, then \u03c7s must be anti- symmetric, or parallel spins. This is called a triplet, since 3 states are possible, and it forms what is called the anti-bonding orbital (ABO) which has zero probability near the middle and higher energy.The reason for this is Pauli's Exclusion Principle. If the spins are opposite, they can be in the same location, and hence the non-zero probablility for symmetric combinations.For anti-parallel spins, the particles cannot be in the same location, and hence must be spatially separated, leading to max probability near the ion core and 0 at the midpoint between the two ion cores.  Image from 'The Physics of Semiconductors\" by Brennan As the atomic spacing increases, there is minimal interaction between atoms and the symmetric and anti symmetric wavefunctions have the same energies. At the molecular spacing distance (Ro) they form distinct energies and are called the valence (symmetric \u03a8 )and conduction bands respectively(anti symmetric \u03a8 ).  Image from 'The Physics of Semiconductors\" by Brennan When you bring more and more atoms together, you get more BO and ABO states, thus forming closely spaced bands. Bands of all the bonding orbitals form the lower-energy valence bands, while a combination of all the anti-bonding orbitals form the conduction bands. If you bring N atoms together, you will have N energy levels each in the valence and conduction bands. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all , what is a band ? It is a collection of energy levels . When an electron revolves around an isolated atom it is subjected to forces only within that atom .But, in a material all the atoms are very close and an electron is subjected to forces from the other atoms too.Each electron has wave function , which defines it motion and this wave function has an energy associated with it. Since , the electron is being subjected to forces by other atoms the electrons are interacting with other electrons and their wave functions are getting altered and therefore the energy associated with them is also altered . So , instead of being associated with a single energy level the electrons are associated with a band if energy levels.In an atom the electrons in the first orbit form an energy level and electrons in second orbit form another energy level and this goes on. The collection of energy levels associated with the outer shell electrons ( valence electrons ) is called valence band.This is of utmost importance is determining the electrical and optical properties of the material.The valence band might be completely filled or half filled .It can never be empty. Now, if the electrons in the valence band gain sufficient energy they can become free electrons .They will be free to move about the entire material .The collection of energy levels associated with the free electrons (since the free electrons are responsible for conduction they are called conduction electrons ) is called conduction band.The extra energy required by a valence electron to move to the conduction band is called the forbidden energy . Depending on the magnitude of free energy we can characterize materials as metals, insulators and semi conductors. ",
