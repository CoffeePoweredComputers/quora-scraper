            "answer_text": "At an air-water interface, a small fraction of each of the components of air (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and argon) will dissolve in the water (Henry's law - Wikipedia) and a small fraction of the water molecules will evaporate into the air (Vapor pressure - Wikipedia). Without mixing, these processes are slow because they can occur only at the air-water interface where both the air and the water quickly become saturated. Each process is sped up by bubbling the air through the water: The spherical air bubble presents a maximum surface area to the water.The turbulence created by the rising bubble mixes saturated water with unsaturated water.",

            "answer_text": "Why do we blow air into the water? What are we really mixing the water with? The main reason for blowing air into water is oxygenation of the water in waste water treatment plants and into lakes to avoid anoxic zones. In waste water treatment plants the oxygen helps the bacteria to decompose our left overs. In lakes anoxic zones may kill fish. Also blowing air into a lake may cause destratification and avoid blue green algae problems. See e.g.: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329557261_Fighting_Blue_Green_Algal_Blooms_Help_Nature_to_Do_the_Job Another reason is cleaning fine dust particles out of the air and humidifying the air to avoid too dry air in our homes.
