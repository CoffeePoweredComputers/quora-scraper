            "answer_text": "According to this article right here: This is the scariest movie of all time, according to science: study it\u2019s the movie Sinister that came out in 2012 starring Ethan Hawke. I like Ethan Hawke but I\u2019ve never even heard of this film until I read that article haha. I thought it would be something like The Exorcist, Halloween, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Evil Dead or whatever. In terms of more modern films, I\u2019ve always found 28 Days Later and The Descent to be films that always genuinely scare me when I watch them. But I guess Sinister it is if that article is accurate. ",

            "answer_text": "1932 Freaks. Allow me to say why, Freaks is a horror movie that deals with real people are are physically challenged, or deformed, while working at a circus freak show. It shows how they interact with each other in their own community. It's scary because they used real people for the part, but is also scary cause it teaches us about ourselves. It was banned for some decades in some countries, and might still be in some. ",
