            "answer_text": "Quinhydrone electrode consists of a Platinum-wire in contact quinhydrone, (black powder) which is an equimolar mixture of quinone and hydro quinone Structure of Quinhydrone is  In highly alkaline medium of pH above=8, the equlibrium of quinone- hydroquinone is destroyed and so it cannot be used in basic or Alkaline medium. Since Quinhydrone is easily oxidised or reduced, it is unreliable in presence of strong oxidising or reducing agents, which could disturb the equilibrium between quinone and hydroquinone.It is also subject to errors in solutions containing proteins of high Concentration.",
