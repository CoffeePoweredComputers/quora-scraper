            "answer_text": "B3LYP (Becke-3 Parameter-Lee-Yang-Parr), is a very common exchange-correlation functional used in Kohn-Sham density functional theory.  It is composed of a linear combination other exchange/correlation functions, that is why is called a hybrid funcitonal. The superscripts , ,  refer different energy functionals that represent either an exchange () or correlation () interaction. The three parameters  , , and  are chosen to best fit experimental energies for a library of atoms and small molecules. This fitting procedure is why many see B3LYP as a semi-empirical method, despite KS-DFT itself being considered an ab-initio approximation.
