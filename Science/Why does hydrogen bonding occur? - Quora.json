            "answer_text": "Hydrogen bonding is a weak (relatively) type of bond that occurs between two hydrogen atoms that are covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such as flourine, oxygen, and nitrogen. Effectively, in a covalent bond, the atoms share electrons. When hydrogen is bonded to oxygen, like in H2O, the oxygen has a lot stronger pull on the electrons. This is because the nucleus of oxygen has 8 protons, as opposed to hydrogen\u2019s 1 proton. This makes the covalent bond \u201cpolar\u201d, because the electrons are shared unevenly. The hydrogen side of the molecule is positive, and the oxygen side is negative. Negative attracts positive and positive attracts negative, so when two water molecules are put next to each other they will naturally align so the oxygen side (negative) lines up with the hydrogen side (positive) of the other molecule. Thats the gist of a hydrogen bond. Compared to ionic and covalent bonds, hydrogen bonding is very weak\u2026 Collectively though, hydrogen bonds can be very strong. H2O has hydrogen bonds, while H2S H2Se and H2Te do not, because sulfur, selenium, and tellurium are not electronegative enough. Because of this H2O has significant higher boiling point than the other 3 molecules, because a lot more energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonding has a significant role in DNA and protein structure. ",

            "answer_text": "When an hydrogen atom is bonded covalantly to an florine oxigen or nitrogen atom hydrogen bonding takes place. Due to high electronegativity of oxygen florine or nitrogen atom electrons are pulled from the electron cloud of the hydrogen atom giving a patial positive character to hydrogen and partial negative character to nitrogen oxygen or florine atom depending on which is present. Now this charges amoung atoms will create bonds between them they maybe intramolecular or intermoleculer(ex water) . These bonds are created due to the partial positive and negative charge created in each atom. They are a type of secondary interactions. A type of dipole dipole interqctions which are very strong. ",
