            "answer_text": "Some individuals have invented these in the history; Computer Telephone - Cell Phone Telephone address book Facsimile Scanner Game Console Video Player Music Player Camera Album Camcorder Binoculars Radio Television Voice recorder Telegraph Mail Alarm / Clock Calculator Converter Ruler Library (Books, dictionaries, maps, encylopedias, folders, etc) Notebook Pen - Pencil - Eraser Newspaper Thermometer Barometer Remote Controller Gyroscope Level tool Money Wallet Tickets Heart Rate Monitor Pulse Oximeter Blood Oxygen Monitor Iris - Fingerprint Scanner Accelerometer GPS Navigation Device Etc. Etc. \u2026and some other individuals put all of them together\u2026 It took longer to invent all those devices than inventing the Smartphone, but if those devices didn\u2019t exist, neither would smartphones\u2026 I think smartphone is one of the most important inventions in the history\u2026 It is more important than all of those inventions together. They wouldn\u2019t fit in my pocket\u2026 BUT\u2026. If you compare penicillin and some other medicines(not all) or a microscope with smartphones, then smartphones suck. So it is less important then life\u2026 For example, an ambulance can be more important than anything else, so wheel is very important for an ambulance, or a propeller for a helicopter ambulance\u2026 Fire is important too, how could we keep warm or cook meat if fire wasn\u2019t invented. Yuck!\u2026 I can find many inventions more important than smartphones. To understand the importance of these inventions; We should ask the person to give up either, one of these or the smartphone\u2026 Electricity (You cannot give up this one, because your smartphone won\u2019t work.)Petroleum (You cannot go and buy a smartphone, or they cannot bring it to you)WC - Bathroom ( No way!)Firetruck. (Either the whole house will burn including the smartphone, or just the smartphone)Portable fire like match sticks or lighter. (If you were a smoker, you would see)Microchips and stuff :)Battery is very important though!\u2026 No?Windows and doors of a house, and the house itself.Money. (LOL)Sex (MORE LOL) But it is not an invention.Farming. (Playing FarmVille won\u2019t fill an empty stomach)Washing machine. (You decide)Dishwasher (Up to you)This list won\u2019t finish. Bye\u2026 ",
