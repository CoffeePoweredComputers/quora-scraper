            "answer_text": "Why don't we have extensive antibody testing for COVID-19? (answering on March 22, 2020) I have been watching for information about antibody tests. The first one I saw announced was on March 3, 2020, but the notice specifically mentioned that it was not approved for clinical testing. Within a few days, there were two more tests available. Then a flood of them appeared, along with a March 19th article in Science News about the development of such tests. New blood tests for antibodies could show true scale of coronavirus pandemic We don't have extensive testing for antibodies against COVID-19 as of March 22, 2020 because: Tests have been available for less than three weeksThere hasn't been time yet to test the tests in people. You'd want, for instance, to make sure that the tests can distinguish reliably between antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and other anti-coronavirus antibodies that people might have.Tests have to be manufactured in enough quantities for extensive antibody testing, then approved and distributed. There's an inevitable time lag just to build manufacturing capability, packaging, shipping, and marketing capability.Health authorities in various places need to figure out how to use antibody testing \u2014 how much of the limited public health time and resources can be devoted to it, and what to do with the results. There will be more pressure to test if it becomes clear that people with antibodies are well protected against infection with COVID-19 and can work with patients.One major use of antibody testing will be in vaccination programs, to document whether participants already have antibodies before receiving experimental vaccines and to monitor for development of immunity after they are vaccinated. The first human trials of candidate vaccines began just days ago.We don't have extensive antibody testing for COVID-19 because we are still working under the constraints of time. ",

            "answer_text": "Mistakes at the CDC, FDA, NIH following the 2009\u20132010 H!N! pandemic. Media too focused on economics and the new Presidency to keep the pubic focused and bring pressure for pandemic response reform. No excuse, just an observation. I sure didn\u2019t pay much attention to 8,000 to 39000 deaths (est. avg. `12,500). The range is large due to late response (1000 dead before an emergency was declared) and limited testing. Sound familiar? We learned of COVID-19 January 3. Tests had to be created and tested to detect something very specific, we did not know about the strain and is easily confused with the flu and other known coronavirus strains. In the rush there were some mistakes and test kits were released that gave incorrect results. Restart, test better and then turn on production. Fortunately, the administration bypassed a lot of bureaucratic procurement procedures and went directly to manufacturers who have stepped up. ",
