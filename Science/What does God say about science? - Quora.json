            "answer_text": "I find the Genesis narrative profound in this regard. Science is, first and foremost, an exercise in nomination. When we discover features of the natural world and observe their apparent relationships we describe them in ways that become the building blocks of theoretical models. As much as philosophical issues like the Measurement problem are interesting, it seems clear to me that we do not create substrates for scientific investigation but rather progressively reveal extant realities by inquiry. What is this? How does it work? Why does it do that? What happens if\u2026? Watch a child exploring anything and you can see the process of sciens in action. Even more beautifully (as our son did often when he was smaller) a young mind may come to you and declare its designations - neologisms amounting to explanations of what it has found. Hence, although my reading of Genesis is far from literal (David Moore's answer to What are the reasons why the book of Genesis in the Bible was the most misunderstood portion of the Bible to the believers and especially to the non-believers of the Bible?) I think that the following excerpt from \u2018when Adam was a boy\u2019 captures the gift of natural philosophy in a poignant way. We are given the potential to say what things are - and that identifies them in an active way. Perhaps the greatest mystery in the philosophy of science is whether truth \u2018exists\u2019 or whether we assign it. Every experiment, every theory, every statistical method is dependent upon the axioms and analyses we decide on to begin with. No evidence begets interpretation, and no interpretation begets evidence. Yet we are nominators, and our nomination is effective. \u201cNow out of the ground the Lord God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.\u201d Genesis\u202c 2:19\u202c ESV\u202c\u202c  ",

            "answer_text": "God\u2019s Word to us deals with matters of the heart and how we choose to regard him/her, and thus how we choose to regard each other. This CAN BE regarded .. as the beginning of ALL human enterprise. Everthing else we do, can cascade from such guidance. Holy Books do not set out to guide us directly in agriculture, or building bridges or wells. It is as wrong to consider a Holy Book as a science guide as it would be to look to a physics book for morning prayers. It can mention the universe.. but not measure it as we scientists do. I dont regard that as \u201cscience\u201d per say. (Sokay of Im wrong..Im a scientist.. my wrongs will be .. corrected in time). Perhaps \u201cRender to Ceaser what is Ceasar\u2019s\u201d applies here. Let me elaborate. Material Science, the over arching science of building buildings and bridges, of seaships and for flying, for electronics, for optics.. it is almost entirely \u201cempirical\u201d .. meaning it was historically studied and all such knowledge amassed.. \u201cfor the empire\u201d. Thus, we have the term \u201cempirical knowledge\u201d. It only exists as it is (carefully) measured and deduced .. and recorded. It is NOT knowledge nor materioal created from nothing. Originally such knowledge was amassed as .. the King\u2019s knowledge.. to help build and protect a kingdom. Such hoarded and protected knowledge was used for many purposes.. to shoe horses, weigh grain, or build castles. (Dont forget, many Kings claimed to be Gods representative to his people) And this empirical knowledge has evolved into empirical datasets so vast and atomically precise.. we can build semiconductor thinking machines.. as small as fingernails. Even as the importance of Kings and empire.. have faded. And so we often forget.. where the practice originated. How we got here. Most of science is this \u201cdata-collection-enterprise\u201d which is accumulated efforts \u201cof men\u201d. The scientific deductions are the success that makes us proud.. as we feel smarter and smarter. Thats a good thing, mostly. And yet, no man has ever \u201cmade the constituents of electrons or atoms.\u201d We just study them to amazing detail. Then some proud men.. just a few.. claim the knowledge of such nature.. as if they were the original creator. And as if they could see through time and space as if to say \u201cwe men CAN know all things\u201d. \u201cWe can know DNA and even someday make life from nothing\u201d. Such proud things to think. As if being good data collectors and big dreamers\u2026 were enough to make us into sub Gods. Perhaps I am wrong and someday we can.. but we are SO SO far from that. We are still mostly using empirical knowledge.. still babes in the woods on a creator comparison. Still mostly .. data collecting clerks. And yet, becoming better and better visionary dreamers about what such data set can mean. What it can do for us. We use our empirical data to build whatever we are building (skyscrapers, jumbo jets, bridges..) Or we use it fir whatever we are busy measuring (stars, the globe, the solar system, Mars soil.. deep deep sea vents..) My opinion.. we are so dependent on measured properties.. we might forget we didnt make .. what we are measuring. We KNOW all to well these measured properties . And yet we are so far from being able to manipulate weather, or planets or stars\u2026 a little humility is in order. We are just amazing measurers, and learn well from this enterprise. Since most of the Holy Books were written well before the word or concept we call science existed, they can respectfully be said to not address the subject directly. And yet they do address HOW we use our efforts, our energies, our hearts and our science; This is addressed well, and if you dig respectfully into the Holy Books, you may find their advice eternally useful. You are free to engage in hundreds of things not addressed in your Holy Book. Just consider HOW you conduct such endeavors, whether it is ice skating.., mountain climbing.. or science. These are just some of many topics typically not addressed in books aimed at the heart and conduct of a good and Godly society. God does not speak to us from the Holy Books about science using the word science.. but about how to live our lives and how to regard and treat each other and his creation. In that sense, it addresses how we our gift of life.. and by association, how we USE science. This is how we believers begin all things in our life, as in submission to His will, trying to align our will.. with his eternal vision. Forever learning to be better humans, and maybe even better scientists..We have been given this unique ability, as a gift to use .. or discard. Our choice. I believe we can do roofing, baking,.. or even science .. according to this advice\u2026 without having such engagement.. spelled out as roofing, baking, ice skating, scuba diving\u2026 or science.a ",
