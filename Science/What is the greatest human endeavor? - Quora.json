            "answer_text": "My first impulse was to ask: on the individual level or on the level of mankind?Actually, it doesn't matter. The greatest human endeavor is peace. On the individual level, it's finding peace with life, the universe and everything (or old age, sickness, death and loss as buddhists would call it). For mankind as a whole, peace is so important but so hard to achieve. In history lessons, we learn about WWI and WWII and the Thirty Years' War and others, and we tend to miss that there is a Fifty Years' War going on right now in the Near East (*), in Israel and Palestine. Ukraine. Civil Wars in many regions. And so on. Peace, especially over an extended period of time, is a temporary exception. Either way, peace is not a decision, it is a complex result from many factors, a result that eludes mankind consistently both on the individual and the collective level since the beginning of times though we have probably been striving for it for as long with the exception of some folks who believe in holy wars. (*) I know in the US it's called \"Middle East\", but living in Europe, it feels way too near to use that term. ",

We need to cooperate together to do it (politics), have the ideas (science) to get ahead, have the right mentality to operate in HARSH environment (altuirism, being able to put the lives of others before their own) and finally have the philosophical ideas to keep going and stay sane.
