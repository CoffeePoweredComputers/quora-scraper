            "answer_text": "Is the force (F) in Coulomb\u2019s Law describing the average electrical force between two charges? No its the exact figure. We\u2019ll start with two charges, one positive and one negative, separated by a distance D.  Suppose that, when we plug in the values, Coulomb\u2019s Law gives us an answer of 10 newtons. That means the positive charge will be pulled towards the negative charge by a force with a strength of 10 newtons, and the negative charge will also feel a force of 10 newtons (towards the positive charge). Since doesn\u2019t the force change at different locations in the electric field? Let\u2019s find out. We\u2019ll keep our negative charge in the same place and move our positive charge.  Now according to Coulumb\u2019s Law the force only depends on the magnitude of the two charges and the distance between them. None of those have changed so it predicts the force should be 10 newtons. Sure enough if we do the experiment that\u2019s what we find. In fact if we move the positive charge to any location we\u2019ll still get 10 newtons of force as long as we don\u2019t change the distance between the charges. The same happens if we move the negative charge. Of course the direction of the force will change, but the original question is talking about the scalar form of Coulumb\u2019s Law, which doesn\u2019t tell us the direction anyway. So in general if we move a charge around in an electric field we will change the force felt by that charge. But Coulomb\u2019s Law isn\u2019t doesn\u2019t apply to just any electric field, it only applies to the electric field around a single point charge. The electric field around a point charge is symmetrical, so the direction between the charge we\u2019re using to measure the field and the charge that creates the field doesn\u2019t affect the magnitude of the force felt at that point. All that matters is the distance, which Coulomb\u2019s Law already takes into account.  ",

            "answer_text": "No, it describes the force between two charges at a fixed separation. F=kQq/r^2 It is like going to the cash machine and getting a balance for your account. It is not an average, it is an sppecific valkue. If things change like moving money in or out, the balance changes. If the charges move and the separation changes, the Force they exert on each other changes. ",
