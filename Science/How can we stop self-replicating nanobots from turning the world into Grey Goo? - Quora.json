            "answer_text": "First, we need to rewrite the question: \u201cHow can we stop self-replicating nanobots from turning the world into Grey Goo?\u201d to \u201cHow can we stop a Nano-tech trained terrorist or psychotic from creating a self-replicating virus like Smallpox or Arsenic atoms from being released in publicly accessible waters or the atmosphere? The \u201cGrey Goo\u201d analogy is misleading. My point here is not whether \u201cNanobot\u201d programmed with opened-AI intelligence and appropriate replication fuels could endanger the Planet but rather how could replication Nano-tech proliferation be controlled in a absolutely fail-safe, secured many that such technology could not be fabricated in someone\u2019s basement or garage. Nuclear bombs proliferation has been controlled until now by governments possessing their complicated fabrication and difficult access to their basic nuclear chemicals by the lack of one side being able to rationally \u2018win\u2019 in a nuclear battle over its opponents, commonly referred to a \u2018MAD\u2019 or Mutually Assured Destruction\u201d. North Korea\u2019s Kim Jun Il appears to have broken into the Nuclear Arms Club with little assurance that he would be expected to act in a rational manner and not use his ICBM capability to launch an atomically tipped missile with no regard for its known consequences. It has taken from 1945 to present or 72 years before the world has had to worry about an intentional nuclear attack from any one nuclear power. The proliferation of sufficient NT knowledge within those trained by or outside the NT scientific community offers little assurance that an NT attacker can be isolated and contained for more than a few years unless drastic steps are now taken to track every individual scientist or student in the world who might pose such a risk. The creation of such an NT-Replication nightmare requires none of the hundreds of centrifuges and access to nuclear fuels that NT does. NT replication could be formulated in a Steve Jobs type garage or basement with little means to monitor such a clandestine operation as would be the case with radioactive nuclear materials. There are other technical reasons that this nightmare may not be as simplistic to pull off as it seems to appear on the surface. For a more detailed scientific discussion on such technical barriers, i suggest starting with K. Eric Drexler\u2019s \u201cRadical Abundance: How a Revolution in Nanotechnology will change Civilization\u201d. ",
