            "answer_text": "From Wikipedia: The evolution of the peppered moth is an evolutionary instance of directional colour change in the moth population as a consequence of air pollution during the Industrial Revolution. The frequency of dark-coloured moths increased at that time, an example of industrial melanism. Later, when pollution was reduced, the light-coloured form again predominated. Industrial melanism in the peppered moth was an early test of Charles Darwin's natural selection in action, and remains as a classic example in the teaching of evolution. In 1978 Sewall Wright described it as \"the clearest case in which a conspicuous evolutionary process has actually been observed.\" The dark-coloured or melanic form of the peppered moth (var. carbonaria) was not known before 1811. After field collection in 1848 from Manchester, an industrial city in England, the frequency of the variety was found to have increased drastically. By the end of the 19th century it almost completely outnumbered the original light-coloured type (var. typica), with a record of 98% in 1895. The evolutionary importance of the moth was only speculated upon during Darwin's lifetime. It was 14 years after Darwin's death, in 1896, that J.W. Tutt presented it as a case of natural selection. Due to this, the idea widely spread, and more people believed in Darwin's theory. ",

            "answer_text": "Bearing in mind that recorded history is not all that long ago, possibly the marmorkrebs crayfish, although that was evolution by chromosomal mutation and only subsequently by selection. In the 1990s an egg laid by a slough crayfish turned out to be triploid. The resulting marbled or marmorkrebs crayfish was a female, physically different from her parents, probably unable to breed with normal slough crayfish, but able to reproduce by parthenogensis. This chance mutation proved so beneficial that mamrokrebs have now spread around the world, self-cloning all the way. ",
