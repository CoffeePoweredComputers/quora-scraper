            "answer_text": "The Coriolis force is just one example of a pseudoforce. Let\u2019s consider a simpler one, the Centrifugal force that we all have experienced when a car makes a turn away from straight line motion. When we sit in the passenger seat (US cars) and the driver makes a sharp let turn we feel ourselves \u2018thrown\u2019 against the door of the car and call this the centrifugal force. An observer standing on the ground watches and says that our \u2018inertia\u2019 kept us moving forward wile the turning cars door pushed us into the circular turn. Newton\u2019s Third Law says that every \u2018real\u2019 force of one object acting on another, always is accompanied by a reaction force acting in the opposite direction. Contact forces always come in pairs, your shoulder pushes on the door and the door pushes back with an equal, opposite force. Every \u2018real\u2019 force will disappear when the it\u2019s reaction force disappears. If there were no door on the car, the \u2018centrifugal\u2019 force would throw you out of the car even though the reaction force of the door has disappeared. This action-reaction pairing is not as trivial as many people think it is. When you hold a rock in your hand it is tempting to say that the upward force of your hand is the reaction force of the gravitational force on the rock (weight). This is NOT true. The reaction force of your hand on the rock is the force of the rock on your hand. If one goes away, the other one does also. Gravity does NOT go away when you release the rock. The reaction force to gravity pulling the rock down is the gravitational pull upwards on the earth, exerted by the rock! The Coriolis force has no action-reaction partner, so it is not part of a Newtonian Inertial Reference System. This defines it as being a pseudo force, just as the Centrifugal force is. ",

            "answer_text": "The Coriolis effect is caused by comparing an object in two reference frames: one rotating, one not. Therefore, depending on your perspective, a projectile can seem to fly off or stay on a linear path. Wikipedia has a great demonstration of this, visit their page for the GIF. The plate is rotating counter-clockwise, we start off by pushing the ball towards the red dot:  As the ball moves, from the top (reference frame of the ball) it appears to go straight, but from the side (reference frame of the red dot) it appears to fly left:  That\u2019s because the plate is moving underneath the ball, so by the time it reaches the edge the dot is somewhere else. For another example, picture this:  You are spinning around holding a ball on a string, and suddenly let go of the string (you stay spinning). Instead of the ball staying in front of you, it travels straight from the release point, moving to the right of your vision. Were you to try hitting something with the ball, you would need to release early to account for this. Such is the Coriolis effect. ",
