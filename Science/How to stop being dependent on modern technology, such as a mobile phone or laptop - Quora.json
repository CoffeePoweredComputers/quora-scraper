I began to implement small scale rules that helped my daughters..no cell phone texting in car...No phones at meals, things like that. I watched a cousin drive up from Florida for Thanksgiving but spent the entire visit on his phone. That \u201cdog won\u2019t hunt\u201d here. Best of luck to you..I really wish you well. ",

            "answer_text": "What should we do to be less dependent on technology? There is an entire movement of getting back to the land, making life simpler, getting rid of whatever technology you can. Research the Corporatism of Chesterton, Belloc, and Salazar, one time Prime Minister of Portugal. This view comes from the encyclical of Pope Leo XIII, RERUM NOVARUM, believe it or not! I would think that by getting back to the land, if possible, many technological \u2018advances\u2019 could be discarded, like cell phones, computers, electricity, cars, etc. If that is impossible for some, anything that makes life harder to bear or demands your constant attention can be abolished from your life! Since this would be on a case by case basis, great variety will be found. Lessening our dependence on technological inventions, can make us more independent, more human. Thus we can become more of a perceived threat to any as-is, or Politically Correct, view of humanity. ",

It can be quite a useful tool in many aspects of our lives. If being too addicted is what is meant, such as wasting too much time on WhatsApp or Facebook, I would set aside some time for yourself a day or place a time limit. Disconnecting the app may also be worth a shot, as each time you would be required to log in. Finding a new hobby or something that is important and has been pending might also help shift the focus.
