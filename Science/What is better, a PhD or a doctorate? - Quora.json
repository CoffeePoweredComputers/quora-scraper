            "answer_text": "As several others have already pointed out, a Ph.D. is a doctorate; that\u2019s what the D stands for. But let me try to answer what I\u2019m guessing you were trying to ask: For many (most?) fields, there\u2019s only one \u201ckind\u201d of doctorate available: If you get a doctorate in History, or Mathematics, or English Literature, or Computer Science, it\u2019s going to be a Doctorate of Philosophy, that is, a Ph.D., so the question doesn\u2019t make any sense. But there are some topics where you can get a \u201cpractitioner\u2019s doctorate,\u201d e.g. an M.D. or a \u201cresearcher\u2019s doctorate,\u201d e.g. a Ph.D. in virology (or some other health-related topic). If that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, here\u2019s what I can tell you: You need to talk to talk to the real experts, which means you need to provide enough information for them to self-identify: What specific field(s) and degree(s) are you considering, and what do you want to do with your life?The Ph.D. is fundamentally a research degree. If you want to practice medicine or work in another non-research field where a doctorate is expected, the Ph.D. is probably not going to be appropriate. On the other hand, if you do want to do research, the Ph.D. is exactly what you want.If you\u2019re not sure, and if you\u2019re talking about medicine, I can say this: I see a lot more articles written by M.D.s than I see surgeries done by Ph.D.s.Good luck with everything!
