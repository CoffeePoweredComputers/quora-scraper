            "answer_text": "Diffusion is the tendency for atoms to move from an area of high concentration to low concentration. Atoms diffuse because they \u201clike\u201d to be in equilibrium; that is, they are more stable if they are in equal concentrations. In regard to cells, molecules can diffuse by simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion. In simple diffusion, molecules transport across a cells semi-permeable membrane on their own, depending on the concentration of the solute on each side of the cells. That is, if there is more solute in the cell, naturally the molecule will tend to move out of the cell. Molecules that use simple diffusion are generally small and non-polar molecules (CO2, H2, for example).In facilitated diffusion, the difference is that a transport protein helps the molecule diffuse across the membrane. A molecule may need assistance from a transport protein if it is large and polar, for example (can not pass through the membrane on its own). Water (H2O), which is small but polar, must use the protein aquaporin to pass through the cell membrane.When a molecule must move from an area of low concentration to high concentration, it must go through active transport. Active transport also uses a transport protein like facilitated diffusion, but the cell must expend energy (ATP) to transport the molecule. This is not diffusion. Other vocab that might be useful: Hypertonic: more soluteHypertonic: more waterIsotonic: water and solute concentrations are equal Hypotonic, Isotonic, and Hypertonic solutions, and how they affect diffusion of molecules in plant and animal cells. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Hope this helps!

            "answer_text": "First you got to understand what is Diffusion. Diffusion is a type of passive transport when molecules spread from regions with high concentration (of this molecules) to low concentration regions. The molecules that will be transportated are usually called \u201csolute\u201d and the fluid or gas that stays on the low concentration area, that will receive the solute is called \u201csolvent\u201d.  The image shows an example of Diffusion, in that case with a uncharged cell in a high concentration extracellular space. In this case the molecules are the solute and the intracellular space has most solvent then Extracellular space, so the molecules spread. In Our Blood An example of diffusion in human body cells occurs in our blood with the red blood cells, when the cell arrives in our lungs, the red cells are empty and the lungs are full of oxygen, knowing that our Red B. Cells composition (hemoglobin) only \u2018connects\u2019 with Oxygen, Dioxide Carbon, or Monoxide Carbon, which one of these three are in your lungs, will spread to your cell just like the image. ",
