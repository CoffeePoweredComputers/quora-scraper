            "answer_text": "The amount of unnecessary duplication this question receives on Quora will get anyone\u2019s nerve, especially because it\u2019s relatively quite easy to explain than any other of Einstein\u2019s works. Anyway, let\u2019s begin answering your question. So, Are you paying attention? Good. If you are not listening carefully, you will miss things. Important things. The year is 1905, a patent clerk publishes four groundbreaking papers that\u2019ll forever change our view of Physics, and will forever immortalize him as the greatest mind to ever walk this planet. One of those papers is this >  This paper gives us the famous Mass Energy Equivalence. But it\u2019s not [math]E=mc^2[/math] [math]m=E/c^2[/math] That\u2019s the original equation Einstein wrote, because that tells us a very singular interesting thing. Energy has mass. Elementary arithmetic will tell you that since c^2 (speed of light squared) is a big number, the mass will be too less to even make a difference, but for objects with massive amounts of energy, it starts to matter. Quick pop quiz. Say you have two identical cups of coffee but here\u2019s the catch, one is steaming hot, while the other is cold. Which one\u2019s heavier? If you answered the hot one, you\u2019re right. Heat is essentially thermal energy, this gives the cup very little extra amount of mass. But, the most famous equation in Physics only works for objects that have mass and aren\u2019t moving. What now?  That\u2019s the complete equation. And as newtonian physics will tell you, anything which is moving has momentum (p=mv). It\u2019s the exact same equation, just accounting motion  As you can see with p = 0 we arrive at our original equation. And now, one last question, and a popular one. Can energy be transformed into mass? NO. THIS IS THE WORST QUESTION YOU CAN EVER ASK. Energy has mass. You don\u2019t convert mass into energy. Nor are they \u201cthe same thing\u201d. That\u2019s all you need to know about the most famous equation in Physics without getting confused. ",

            "answer_text": "Conservation of quantity mv2 was the original concept of Energy and this conservation principle was found either by Huygens or Leibniz. Leibniz used to call it \u2018Vis Viva\u2019. Vis Viva = mv2 Newton was having intellectual rivalry with Leibniz so he avoided to use this concept in his work. Later Physics establishment renamed this concept as \u2018Energy\u2019 and divided it into \u2018Potential Energy\u2019 and \u2018Kinetic Energy\u2019 in such way that this division was not properly consistent with Newton\u2019s Physics. Einstein inherited this mv2 tradition of Energy. It was not a new thing at all. In fact, just two years before Einstein, an Italian scientist Olinto De Pretto had published E=mc2. Following are the words of a supporter of Einstein i.e. Jack Fraser: Is it true that in 1903, the Italian scientist Olinto De Pretto published that [math]E = mc^2[/math], two years before Einstein? He published a paper which stated that the potential energy of a particle in motion is given by mv2, and then asserted that this motion could be equated to the mass vibrating at speed c in the Luminiferous Aether, leading to a statement that E=mc2. He did this in 1903, two years before Einstein published special relativity \u2014 seemingly pipping Einstein to the post! Supporters of Einstein defend him on grounds that Einstein had derived this equation in a different way and \u2018c\u2019 in his equation does not mean physical speed but means a universal constant. Their whole argument is that Einstein is talking about energy of state of rest of matter but Olinto was talking about moving matter. Olinto was not right. Matter could only hypothetically move at speed \u2018c\u2019. Einstein was also not right because \u2018c\u2019 is universal constant only when we are talking about speed of light. But when we are talking about matter and mass, then \u2018c\u2019 is not any universal constant. Then c is only hypothetical maximum value of a variable \u2018v\u2019. Here please check Jack Fraser\u2019s criticism of Olinto: First of all \u2014 where the hell did the factor of 1/2 go?! I can see no justification for why he dropped the factor of 1/2 from the kinetic energy \u2014 everyone knows E=1/2mv2 \u2014 yet he throws the half away*! Jack Fraser should first try to learn from where this 1/2 actually came from? Original Vis Viva was simply mv2. Later Physics Establishment had divided it into two sub formulas but without any solid basis. Secondly when Olinto was assuming the maximum possible speed in the form of \u2018c\u2019 then K.E (in his system) had become total energy. So there was no need of 1/2 in this formula. Exact same thing is actually done in Einstein\u2019s formula. Khuram Rafique's answer to Why is the energy in resting matter E=mc^2 so high? It is said that this wonderful formula E=mc2 describes energy equivalent of mass at rest. Since value of c is so high so an ordinary mass at rest will be possessing huge quantity of energy. It is also said that this formula rightly predicted such things as Nuclear Bomb. Whereas fact is that this formula only describes such an hypothetical situation where velocity \u201cv\u201d of a mass has reached to the standard maximum value i.e. \u201cc\u201d. So actually this formula has nothing to do with state of rest of mass. It is so assumed that this formula describes energy equivalent of mass at rest because \u201cc\u201d has been considered a \u201cuniversal constant\u201d. Whereas, fact is that within the context of matter having mass, \u201cc\u201d is not any \u201cuniversal constant\u201d. \u201cc\u201d is just the standard maximum value of a \u201cvariable\u201d which is velocity \u201cv\u201d. Despite official claims of Science, there are so many unofficial counter claims that speed of light \u201cc\u201d is not constant or even the maximum possible speed. But here we don\u2019t need to go against official claims. Let us accept that speed of light may be constant and may it be the maximum possible value of \u201cv\u201d. But point is that even then \u201cc\u201d cannot be regarded as \u201cuniversal constant\u201d when talking in terms of matter and mass. Because after all then it is only a value of a variable \u201cv\u201d. So in this sense, if \u201cc\u201d is not a universal constant, it means that formula E=mc2 is not describing state of rest of mass. It is only describing an hypothetical situation where value of speed (i.e. a variable \u201cv\u201d) of certain mass has reached to the standard maximum value which is \u201cc\u201d. In this right context, actually formula E=mc2 is just worthless. It is only the case of such a K.E which, due to the mass having been reached to the maximum value of velocity (may be just hypothetically), has become Total Energy. Nuclear Bomb was the result of later discoveries of hidden Nuclear forces and was not the result of this formula. Neither this formula has anything to do with those nuclear forces. It is the nature of Nuclear Structure of any atom which determines energy contents of that element. Mere \u201cmass\u201d does not determine it. If it were the case then Scientists should not have needed Uranium etc. because they could get mere mass from other common elements like iron etc. also, for making Nuclear Bomb. ",
