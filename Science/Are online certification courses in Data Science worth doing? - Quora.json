            "answer_text": "Data Scientist has become such a glorified job title, that nowadays some have started calling themselves data scientists, based on the work they do and not because of the data science degree they have, while others acquire the job title by procuring a particular data science degree and some through data science online course certifications. Data Scientist Certifications do provide all the essential skills for becoming a data scientist and the quality of data science online courses from Digital Vidya, Coursera, Udacity and Udemy is very high. Courses are designed keeping in mind the need for data science skillset and offer a comprehensive Data Science Online Course in Python and R, which is created by experts who are currently working in the industry as Data Scientists who are currently working with top IT companies. The certificates help beginners and also advanced students to gain an in-depth understanding of basic concepts of data science i.e. statistics, machine learning, and algorithmic implementations in popular data science programming languages- Python and R. You also get to know about the real-world problems a data scientist encounters regularly \u2013 anomalies, missing data, corrupt data, etc. and how to solve them. Many certifications also provide a One-on-one mentoring session with the best data scientists in the industry that help students easily understand the entire data science process. A data science degree or a MOOC cannot get you a job as a data scientist, it is ultimately the skills that matter. Having a data science degree is not a bad thing but without experience and internship, cracking the interview for a data scientist job, at top tech companies is difficult. However, not having a data science degree helps candidates prove that they are more than willing to become a data scientist- by having a data science online course certification with many hands-on projects and a GitHub account validating your practical data science skills. Hands-on project experience shows employers that a candidate can actually do things on the job. It is not necessary to have a data science degree or a post-graduate degree. All it requires is enough baseline knowledge with the ability to adapt and learn. Resources for Data Science Courses: Digital Vidya offers a Certified Data Science course with Python which is completely online.Data Science: Online Courses from Harvard, MIT, Microsoft | edXData Science Online Courses & Programs | UdacityData Science Courses | Data Science Certification \u2013 upGradI hope this helps. Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on a lot of things. Let me talk about a few: Your Goals For Learning: Why do you want to learn Data Science? If it to start a career in the field? Or is it to add an additional skill to your professional profile? I suggest you think about your reasons for studying it first. The Institute/Platform You Choose: There are a lot of institutes offering Data Science courses these days. If you select one that has a comprehensive practice-based curriculum then it will be more helpful to you. The Effort You Put In: We all live busy lives. In the midst of the busy schedule, how much time and effort can you put for learning something as advanced as Data Science? I suggest the following institute for Data Science:  I would also like to discuss the things I suggest you check if you do plan to learn Data Science Online from an institute: Syllabus: Check if they cover the topics in-depth or just touch upon the basics. Topics like Data Processing, Data Analysis, Visualization, Statistical Methods, Machine Learning related concepts, Numpy, Pandas, etc. should be checked out by you. Faculty: Go for a course where the faculty is highly qualified and experienced. If the teachers have worked in Data Science, then they will be able to explain better. Real World Projects: Projects are very valuable in Data Science. The more you work on them, the better your skills and knowledge become. It helps your portfolio also. Interviewers prefer people with project experience. ",
