            "answer_text": "Terms You say \"Science,\" so I'll take that as Science & Technology (as part of the spectrum that leads to Research & Development). And, I'll make my points as it may apply to \"Industry S&T. You may be aware that there are National Labs, DOE Labs, DOD Labs all chasing a range of 6.1 (basic), 6.2 (advanced) and 6.3 (applied) S&T with research efforts across that spectrum.  E.g., 6.1 Research in quantum optics: how to squirt photons/photon pairs at-will, and increase spins on the photons to make denser qubits (data per photon), so as to move quantum comms towards a decent demo/prototype.reference = Page on Nature on AFOSR & quantum optics Industry S&T It is too bad we don't see more answers to this Quora question.  I would love to see more perspectives on this. It has been decades since we/USA have lost the true research institutes (Bell Labs, et al).  They exist, but in a different form, with different goals.reference = Where Have You Gone, Bell Labs? So the more \"pure research\" is now supplanted with industry research that tends to be more product focused.  Even the DARPA supported research is of a different flavor than the 1980s. Looking to public data, you can find analyses to answer \"Who invests in research?\" And so, you will find top lists of Research % vs. Earnings Before Interest & Tax (EBIT) plotted over a timeline of Growth through years.reference = You cannot buy innovation You will see Apple, Google, Microsoft, HP, Sony, Ericcson, Nokia, etc. But, the data won't really tell you *how* they invest in *what* research.E.g., Google appears to invest in a somewhat-broad range of basic, advanced, and applied research ... whereas Apple is more product-centric (range) in more advanced, applied (much less basic). For google, e.g., you can read their research papers. A paper such as \"Ensuring Connectivity via Data Plane Mechanisms\" appears to focus on a part of a research \"hard problem\" set in communications.  reference = People - Research at Google This question is in the forefront of my mind this year. You see, S&T / R&D budgets tighten and the \"Curse of Plenty\" lightens up. This allows for changes to S&T planning & investment so that leverage of Industry Research can be a part of an \"innovation strategy\" Curse reference:  Paradox of Plenty ",
