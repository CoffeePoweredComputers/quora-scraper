            "answer_text": "Hello You set no restrictions so I will refer to a classic example where impurities do not increase the boiling point of a liquid. First of all is the question: what is an impurity?The first plot is a so called Txy (temperature vs x composition) diagram and it describes for a biphasic system the zones    taken from youtube:  where this Liquid Vapor systems contains only liquid, that is below the blue curve. The region above the green line is only vapor and the region in between is where there is equilibrium between liquid and vapor. As you can see the left vertical axis represents pure A, and the point where the green and blue curves intersect that axis is the boiling temperature for pure A substance. The same applies to the left but this time it indicates the boling point of substance B pure. If you take a sample of pure A and add a small volume of pure B you will have a depression of the boiling point. If do just the opposite adding a small amount of A to pure B you will have an increased boiling point. Sometimes it increases and others decreases. The second image shows that adding methanol (bp 64.7C) to ethanol (bp 78C) reduces the overall bp. It does not increase. These two examples are for ideal binary mixtures, notice that ethanol and methanol are very similar. For other substances the behaviour is not ideal and they exhibit more or less strong deviations. A very good example is the system ethanol-water. Look at the yellow graph. On one side if you add ethanol to water , that will depress the bp. This time doing the opposite will not increase it to a certain extent. You see that teh bp of ethanol will also decrease. Liquids will have considerable vapor pressure in contrast to solids. The mixture total pressure will be the addition of the two contributions. There are negative and positive deviations to the ideal behaviour (Raoult\u00b4s law). Mixing W and E is exothermic, that means part of the bonding energy among water molecules (dipole-dipole, hydrogen bonds, London) is released and the new bonding is less energetic leading to less strong bonding, easier to boil. The positive deviations come from stronger intermolecular bonding. In the case of electrolytes there is a dissociation reaction and the newly formed entities are more stable (Debye-H\u00fcckel-Onsager). Please check this linkhttps://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/phaseeqia/nonideal.ht -ideal mixtures of liquids. Plots were taken from youtube Hope this helps a bit. You can deeper into the topic by studiyng the physical chemistry of phases diagrams. . ",

            "answer_text": "A liquid boils because the increase in temperature makes the molecules move faster and faster until their kinetic energy is sufficient to overcome those attractions. If a substance dissolves in the liquid, it is because the attractions between the molecules of the substance have greater attraction to the molecules of the liquid, and because the dissolution increases the disorder of the liquid (increased entropy). To boil the solution will require more energy to overcome the attractions of the solute and the liquid as well as the molecular attractions within the liquid. ",
