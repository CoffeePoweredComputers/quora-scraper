            "answer_text": "I think I firstly need to establish what you mean by electricty. If there is some ice on the path will a couple of buckets of electricity shift it? I suspect not but your idea of electricity may different. Do you mean : charge , current , potential difference, electrical energy, electrical power etc. ? What exactly is electricity because I know of no formal meaning? If I am free to choose what it measn then the question becomes a bit simple. Can an electric heater melt ice? Of course it can. You melt ice by supplying thermal energy and that is exactly what electrical heaters do. Many sports pitches have underground heating so that they do not get frozen in the winter. ",
