            "answer_text": "Because adopting left wing or progressive politics tends to push you in a more critical and therefore academic direction. The reason is that the left, broadly speaking, want to change society to be more just or equal. In order to legitimate that change, in order to justify it to themselves, they need to analyse that society and show, first of all, why it is unjust or unequal, and second of all, why their politics would be a solution to that injustice and inequality. They need to explain what equality or justice means, and so on. These questions can take the people on the left in some very abstract and complex directions. Moreover, I\u2019d add a historical dimension to this and say that the academy has only really been left leaning since about the 1960s or 1970s. This was a time when more working and middle class people started getting university degrees, which meant more people from these classes became academics and there were more academic jobs for them to fill. It was also after the \u201cradicalization\u201d of the 1960s, when a lot of young people adopted left wing politics, but when their political goals failed to materialize they retreated into academia to reflect upon what went wrong. Prior to this, the academy was generally a lot less politicized. People tended to treat academic work in a more neutral way. Contrast this to the right\u2026 Right wing politics, very generally speaking, does not want to change society but rather preserve or restore it. The legitimacy of right wing views are based on the idea that things are already working now and are therefore functional and do not need radical change or reform (hence conservatism). The more far right you go, the more reactionary they become and the more they tend to legitimate their views based on tradition, or racial purity, or nationalist sentiment, or religion, etc. The simple fact of the matter is that appealing to these things does not push you in the direction of a complex and elaborate critique of existing society. It pushes you in the direction of assuming that these things justify themselves, and do not need an elaborate explanation by some academic. Now the caveat to this is that there are still intellectuals and academics of the right who do develop sophisticated justification of the way their society functions. There are some very intelligent people in, for example, philosophy and sociology who do this. But within the political right, they aren\u2019t important but rather marginal figures. Contrast this with the left, and you\u2019ll see that the left are much more attracted to academic jargon and the ideas of academics (even when they only have a crude understanding). Because talking about something like, for example, why we need gender neutrality, needs a lot more explanation than just appealing to received wisdom and saying something like \u201cthere are two genders, assigned at birth, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been and it will always be, period\u201d.

            "answer_text": "There are multiple reasons for that one of which is that the personality descriptors of those who happen to pursue academia at a higher level (high in Openness and low in Conscientiousness) are also predictors of left-liberal political leaning. But more fundamentally, \u201cintellectuals\u201d, especially those on the far left and nested inside the academia tend to have a bias whereby they prefer systems in which you can just articulate a bunch of axioms and verbal propositions and you want that some kind of bureaucratic or governmental body simply \u201cimplements\u201d them. Many of the Left\u2019s political theories fit nicely into this structure. There is some oppressor-oppressed dynamic in which both are treated as some kind of a superorganism and there is a dialectic between them which is going to create \u201crevolution\u201d and so on. Governments and committees are supposed to have an overarching aim of subtractive egalitarianism and a cosmic Justice (with a capital J) However there are many phenomena in social life in which intelligence and expertise is distributed among millions and billions of people. Most people have no control or knowledge of how things happen to be the way they are. Complex products and complex systems emerge out simply by local operations of expertise and knowledge and intelligence and intuitions. It is hard to find a nice political or economic theory of it. Market economies are a good example of that. Language is another one. No committee really \u201cdecides\u201d or decided which words should form a part of the vocabulary or set the context in which a word should be used nor which ones are \u201callowed\u201d to be used. These kinds of systems of distributed intelligence where there is no designer (evil or otherwise) and which gives rise to a collective product goes against the sentiments of the way many \u201cintellectuals\u201d prefer to think.
