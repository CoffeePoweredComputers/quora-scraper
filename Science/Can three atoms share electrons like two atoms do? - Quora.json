            "answer_text": "Actually, electrons can be shared by lot more than two or three atoms. Those are called delocalized electrons. In Benzene ring, all six carbons share 6 pi electrons. Delocalization adds to the stability of a molecule, which is why benzene is more stable than equivalent alkene or cyclo hydrocarbon. Delocalized electron - Wikipedia Typically, you will find delocalization happening over a flat molecule with alternate C - C single and double bonds. ",
