            "answer_text": "The term \"empath\" is science fiction term first used in an episode of Star Trek. So, from a clinical standpoint, there is no such thing as an empath, at least not in the way it is often described here. It's possible to be extremely empathetic so many people would consider themselves an \"empath\" in that respect. However, often searched much differently in this forum. In this context, \"Empaths\" believe they feel emotions at a deeper level than others, in turn making them more sensitive to the feelings of others. Some people even feel they experience the feelings of others in an almost literal sense. This is actually not that unusual - a lot of people are empathetic to the extent that they'll cry when someone else is sad, or feel genuinely happy when they see joy in someone else. This is affect empathy. Some have less of this and more cognitive empathy- a high ability to imagine themselves in someone else's shoes. These people are less judgemental and genuinely understand the behavior of others even if they don't agree with it. They may seem less empathetic to others but they're not - it's just a different type (and the one most obviously lacking in people with autism). As for the energy, I hear people say they feel a certain energy when someone enters a room all the time. They may or may not experience it in the literal sense, but it feels that way nonetheless. This is also very common - highly sensitive people will notice more, less sensitive people will notice less. What people who consider themselves \"empaths\" may have that others don't, is a hyper-sensitivity (or hypervigilance) that makes them more attuned to subtleties in facial expression, body language and tone of voice. This could be a response to trauma where the nervous system works overtime causing one to be in an almost constant state of fight or flight. This high attunement to other people ultimately leads to a preoccupation with them. That and a lack of boundaries can make relationships difficult and even painful. The attention/validation \"empaths\" require to maintain a self esteem is exhausting for many people but very attractive to narcissists. \"Empaths\" may consider themselves such because it helps them make sense of how they perceive and respond to the world. Is it an accurate perception? It's not my place to say how one perceives their experiences, and a person can call themselves whatever they want. The problem lies in a potential denial of reality and the attributing of such experiences to a metaphysical gift. ",

            "answer_text": "most of the answers are in professional terms or simply lazy. I would say empaths are real and most of them are not aware of it until they start to find answers having been hurt for most part of their lives figuring people out which basically you won\u2019t find any answers to cure this but to relieve your own self with a little glimmer of hope where hope itself will be your biggest downfall in your life having been gifted with a big heart that feels and absorbs so much pain without being responded or rewarded in the right manner. Nope, you are not from star trek and you don\u2019t have magical or super powers. the word magic and super power has overly been used in movies and comics that a blue light needs come out of your hands or eyes in a very awkward and impossible manner to be considered anything near magic and super power. If you consider magic and super power in every day life thing, then taking away the pain and to ease someone without anything in return is indeed a magical act. Yes you do posses super powers. It all depends on you with how you look and perceive things. It will be a much more difficult task that shooting lasers out of your a$$. Excuse my language. You should also take into consideration that where you were born, grew up etc.. as different countries, regions, states, environment, cultures operates in a very different microscopic way in detail. Yes everyone is born with almost all the chemicals in our body to react in a certain way that which includes empathy I suppose. But I believe you need to be gifted to trigger it within yourself just like music or an acting talent. If you don\u2019t have it, you don\u2019t have it. It must also have something to do with your parents, the right parents who were meant for each other as in you and them to trigger this supposed gift or a curse. And mine is just a guess, a very good one I believe. We can\u2019t say Hitler and his army had some sort of empathy in them now could we? and there were , are many others. The act of cruelty has just changed from physical to mental nowadays because of law and order, ill people got smarter and made it easy for themselves. But here\u2019s the thing, without these nasty people. The empaths are nobodies. So live with it. ",

It is so ubiquitous that not having empathy results in being labeled with some pretty serious mental illnesses. An 'empath' is simple someone whose naturally sense of empathy is greater that usual. People often talk about the 'energy of a room' or how draining it is to spend time with someone suffering from depression. Comments like these are all within the realm of empathy. For an empath, moments like above are a daily occurance. They are picking up on emotions and energy levels of everyone around them all the time. Their sense of empathy is like a finely tuned and sensative instrument. Empathy is not metaphysical. It is not the same as clairvoyance or precognition or any of that. The idea that it is most likely arised from low empathy individuals perceiving an empath has having knowedge they could not possibly have, or from empaths themselves trying to inflate their own sense of importance.

And they do seem to recognize us. I can fool her! That\u2019s a very interesting game for them to play. We attract a lot of them, so we have a lot of practice. We know what animals feel. What little children feel. We can feel it. My favorite empath moment in recent years is I was talking to a woman I had just met. Actually it was a phone call set up by a man who knew us both. I said, \u201cI have to tell you I was dreading this call.\u201d She said, \u201cI was, too.\u201d I said, \u201cAre you an emotional empath?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, yes, I am.

It\u2019s an ability to feel exactly what another person is feeling As they feel it. Is the ability real, it would depend on who you ask. If you ask a person who does not have the ability they may say no. Those same individuals will probably say people do not have the ability to read minds (telepathy), speak to spirits (mediums), predict the future (prophecy), hover in the air (levitate) and the list goes on. But if you ask a person who actually do these things they will say it\u2019s very real, they\u2019re doing it. So you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself.

My empathy has increased throughout the years because when you face huge traumas in your life and someone is kind to you, then you appreciate that kindness that much more. So why not try to make a difference in the lives of the people we encounter? Why are we not aware that through a little gesture, we can bring a smile to someone who probably is facing huge difficulties in their lives? Nowadays you encounter loads of people walking and looking at their mobile phones completely oblivious to the people around them! ",

They have a heightened sense of awareness and have learned to identify facial expressions and voice tone to change their behavior to avoid punishment or shame from the abusers. This was a defense mechanism to avoid more emotional/physical abuse. I cannot say this for all people who identify as empaths, but probably around 40 to 45% of them. ",

Because in modern society , everyone feels the need to be \u201cspecial\u201d and driven by their ego, they will come up with any sort of nonsense. First of all, there's no such thing as being pure logical or being pure emotional like an empath. Everyone , I repeat, EVERYONE is capable of logical and emotional thinking. It's just a matter of choice. That choice is made in your subconscious , and someone tend to choose to rely on their emotions more than their logic. And the rational ones chose logic over emotions. It is possible to be conscious of this choice making of yours, but it takes practice. ",
