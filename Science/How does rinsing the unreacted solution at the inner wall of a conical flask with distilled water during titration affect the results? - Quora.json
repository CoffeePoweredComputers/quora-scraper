            "answer_text": "After adding titrant from the burette it is important to ensure that all of it is mixed with the sample and has reacted. This is done by rinsing down the sides of the flask with water. In this way we avoid adding more titrant than actually necessary to reach the end-point and hence avoid getting a falsely-high volume reading. In this situation the analyte concentration would appear to be more concentrated than it really is. How much water you use for the rinsing doesn\u2019t matter since the number of moles of titrant dispensed and the number of moles of analyte present (what we\u2019re interested in) don\u2019t change on adding water. All that matters is that you accurately record the volume of titrant dispensed (titre) and the volume of analyte solution you use in each case (measured with a pipette). ",
