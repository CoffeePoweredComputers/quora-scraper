            "answer_text": "I would break down the negative (i.e. harmful) side effects of science and technology into two types: 1) due to misusing, 2) due to misunderstanding. Due to misusing can be further broken down into two groups: a) intentional; b) unintentional. So now some examples: 1.a (intentional misuse) - I would place all mass killing weapons in this category. (I personally consider individual killing weapons (firearms and edge weapons) to be ok, as they can be justified for self defense and food procurement). 1.2 (unintentional misuse) - this category covers your run-off-the-mill harmful \u201cside effects\u201d like pollution, encroachment on natural habitats (i.e. effects harmful not directly to us humans but to other inhabitants of the planet) physical and mental atrophy from over reliance on our tools (things like weaker bodies thanks to vehicles, weaker memories thanks to Google, and so forth\u2026) 2. (Misunderstanding). This one is trickier. I have always struggled with the fact that I intuitively know Untruth to be bad, but do not intuitively know why. Nevertheless, this is my answer. Science and technology are harmful insofar as we incorrectly believe them to be something they are not. And what they are not is: cure-alls (specifically, evil cannot be engineered out of the world); or alternatives philosophy/religion (specifically, science canot explain existence nor provide us with purpose) ",

            "answer_text": " The war equipment that was produced by military scientists had several negative effects on the society. Many soldiers lost their lives during this war. In addition, some of them sustained serious injuries after being attacked by tanks. Statistics from World War I reveal that around 117, 465 casualties were reported (Ross 107). Some soldiers who returned from this war developed a posttraumatic stress disorder. Some of them started having nightmares and sleepless nights after remembering how their fellow soldiers died during battle. Science and technology have brought harmful effects to society since it was used to manufacture war equipments during the World War II. Nazi scientist invented RocketV-1, buzz bomb, during the World War II. This aircraft was categorized as a guided missile and the Nazi mainly used it in 1944-1945 (Ross 81). The science and technology that was used in World War II had several negative effects to society. The economy of Japan deteriorated. This is because the atomic bomb destroyed its infrastructure. World War II also affected the Soviet Union. About 40 million people lost their lives due this war (Bishop 71). Germany used its advance weapons to kill civilians in the Soviet Union. Scientists also use advancements in science and technology to conduct human experimentation. Such experiments are harmful to human beings since they may have negative effects to the growth and development of people under study. One of the famous human experimentations was known as the monster study (McCuen 64). Negative Effects of Science and Technology ",

The whole day and they lost their precious time only on smart phones . Instead of playing outdoors games . They stuck into social media . Outdoors games makes them physically as well as mentally fit . But children are only finding Interest on smart phones According to me the government should practice such law that everyone can only use mobile only 2\u20133 hours per day and more than it the government should cutt off the network . So that the children's are forced to do all the activities and work and they will only do that work only that they really want . Social media has many impacts as well as effects . But we should be concern about that is it harmful or beneficial for us . Doing something by thinking a lot is beneficial . Children should use its benefits such as participation in quizes , puzzles reasoning ,doubt solving instead of sticking in licking someone's photograph . So children must be aware about that ",

            "answer_text": "Disadvantages of science not much but technology, yes. Technology has in our lives helped in creating comfort, increasing productivity and connecting more of us with each other. While it has some advantages like I can effortlessly travel between two far away places, do more stuff in a day and talk to my mom and dad over the internet where we are miles away from each other, it has its pitfalls. First, it has made us move less than we used to. We don't walk much as our ancestors did. We don't lift things to clean, slog and move our muscles to do household chores. This makes one of the greatest problems of the western world - obesity. Secondly, increased productivity and better refrigeration means increased production of processed foods. Junk foods with high concentrations of sugar and fat. Again a problem that is faced globally and in more in the western world like diabetes, high cholesterol, coronary heart disease. Etc. Thirdly, connecting more of us with each other. This is a boon and a bane. When you are Connected it's not just you who gets access to the internet but also that the internet has access to you. This can have adverse consequences if not used cautiously like cyber data crimes - e.g. The recent Facebook-Cambridge analytica issue which led to personally identifiable information to be sold without consent to a third party by Facebook. Finally, it's not just the technology to be really blamed here. It's the abuse of technology like misusing or total reliance on technology for basic tasks that make it a disadvantage. ",

Even if the calculator is a good invention, man no longer makes mental calculation and no longer works his memory. Increased dependency on modern tools like calculators and spell checkers has reduced our creativity and intelligence. The negative impact of the influence of technology on children should not be underestimated as well. Science has been responsible for pollution and has given us the nuclear bomb which threatens our very existence. But in this also fault lies not with science, but rather with mans intention to misuse the discoveries of science. Science is not inherently good or evil. It is a way to acquire knowledge systematically. It depend on us how we use it. ",
