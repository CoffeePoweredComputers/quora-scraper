            "answer_text": "So first off, Organisms don\u2019t evolve. I know perhaps you have been told they do but they don\u2019t. An organism is an individual entity. An organism may develop (most do) but it will never evolve. Evolve means a change in the allele frequencies within a population of organisms. Only populations ( reprodutively connected groups of a species) evolve. So then, NO since no individual organism has ever evolved no individual organism has ever been enhanced by evolution. But then what about populations. Yes populations are enhanced through evolution. But what does enhanced mean in this context. Enhanced in this context of evolution would refer to the \u201cFIT\u201d between the population of organisms and its environment. Through the natural processes of evolution the members of a population that are less fit to the environment for the result of survival to reproduction die out before reproducing and so subsequent generations fitness for the environment is enhanced.

            "answer_text": "Using \u201cenhanced\u201d by itself as you have implies that there is some well known scale by which organisms are measured and as such it need not be named in the statement. There is no such scale. When a species evolves its members are better adapted to their environment. Only their ability to survive in that environment might be said to have enhanced, and a future change to their environment can turn that enhancement into a detriment. ",

Organisms evolve to better suit the environment they\u2019re living in, but they\u2019re not objectively \u201cbetter\u201d. I believe adaptations to people in some tropical countries means they are likely to sufffer less from malaria, but that same mutation means they\u2019re more likely to suffer from sickle cell anaemia - so whether the adaptation is \u201cbetter\u201d depends on how much of a threat malaria is\u2026in Northern Europe, not much; in Africa\u2026 How sickle cell protects against Malaria ",
