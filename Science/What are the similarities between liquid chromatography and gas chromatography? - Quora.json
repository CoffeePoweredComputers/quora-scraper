            "answer_text": "1. Both of them require fluids (liquid/gas) as mobile phase. 2. Both of them use columns as stationary phase. Typically, longer columns give better separation results 3. Analytes can be distributed evenly in the mobile phase (dissolve/volatile). If not, the columns might be clogged 4. The stronger of the analyte-stationary phase interaction, the longer the retention time 5. Typically, the two instrument systems have similar components: Autosampler, column, detector, and computer. Very often, the same company supplies both GC and LC: Agilent, Waters, Thermo, etc. 6. A lot of factors can affect the separation result: temperature, mobile phase flow rate, column type, gradient, etc. So method development can be time consuming for both of them ",
