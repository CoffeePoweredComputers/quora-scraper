            "answer_text": "How different is a particular person\u2019s consciousness from another person\u2019s? It\u2019s very hard to say, because we each only have direct access to precisely one consciousness \u2014 our own! I don\u2019t know exactly what the world looks like to you. Is the red that I see the \u2018same\u2019 as the red that you see? There is no way to be sure*. But since humans have language, we can communicate at least some aspects of our subjective experience. Plus we have art and music and other forms of expression that convey \u2018inner\u2019 states to some extent. Our primordial form of communication, which we share with animals to varying extents, is body language. You have to be somewhat hard-hearted not to recognize emotions like pleasure, sadness, disgust and even curiosity and boredom in many animal species. So we can say that at least some species have a kind of consciousness that overlaps somewhat with human consciousness. But this topic is still controversial. There have often been people, particularly in the western world, who assert that animals lack consciousness and/or a \u2018soul\u2019. Clearly there are plenty of differences between humans and animals, so it should be uncontroversial that there are certain kinds of subjective state that don\u2019t really occur in animals \u2014 particularly states involving language or complex cultural practices.  Notes * This unsureness about other peoples\u2019 experiences has generated several thought experiments. One of the most famous is the inverted spectrum. What if the colors that you see are completely different from what I see? How would either of us know? Since our labels completely overlap, we would not be able to use language to describe any differences in experience \u2014 meaning we would not be able to determine if there were any differences. Differences in taste sometimes make us wonder about other peoples\u2019 conscious experience. If you like chocolate, it\u2019s hard to imagine a subjectivity in which chocolate is disgusting. But there are people who don\u2019t like chocolate! Perhaps even basic sensory experiences differ just as our aesthetic responses to them do?  For more on this topic, as well as some links to material on \u2018plant consciousness\u2019, see the following: Yohan John's answer to What is the actual level of awareness in domestic cats and dogs from a neuroscientific point of view? How can we understand their level of consciousness?

            "answer_text": "The differences between consciences are a matter of content. A brain experiences things with the help of representative models stimulated more or less intensely according to the information that reaches it from the outside on the one hand, and that it generates intrinsically on the other hand. The sophistication of a representation (the pile of concepts on which it is perched) makes the richness of the conscious sensation. Animals have different contents of humans, more coarse for most mental functions, but more elaborate on some specific points. They all have a language, less verbose of course than that of humans, but which nevertheless allows them to exchange essential information for their species. Some sensory sensors, in animals, are more efficient than ours. For example the dog consciously experiences a palette of olfactory representations probably as rich as the range of our own visual images. Of course he does not build, above, a conceptual universe as complex as ours. It does not have the necessary cortical neural stacks. It is more difficult to decide on the imaginary universe of species with large brains, such as marine mammals, or elephants. Probably they have a much more complex metaphysics than we imagine. They are not permanently monopolized by food and social automatisms. The translation is not simple. Lack the brains raised in both languages. An interesting experience would be a human / elephant couple raising a duo of human / elephant children and speaking to both in their own language. No doubt they would become effective bridges between the two species. It remains to find the man who would want to marry an elephant\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "What separates human consciousness from other animals\u2019 consciousness? Consciousness is the state or quality of awareness , or, of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of explaining the relationship between physical phenomena, such as brain processes, how and why we have qualia or phenomenal experiences. Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of any kind of pain, any taste, as well as what you see such as red, emotions, feeling an itchy, feeling hunger, feeling cold or hot, feeling dizzy. Note: I have done thought experiments on myself and I do not know what it would be like to have awareness of zero qualia. We must have one or more qualia to be conscious. The word \u201cseparate\u201d, for this question, means something not shared. I would like to give some examples of qualia with another animal \u2026 mostly dogs. I will leave it up to you to decide in each case how human consciousness is \u201cnot shared.\u201d For dogs, their color vision is most similar to a human with red-green color blindness, although there are other differences. Dogs are less sensitive to variations in gray shades than humans are, as well as only about half as sensitive to changes in brightness. Dogs also tend to be nearsighted to varying degrees. Dogs have about 1,706 taste buds. Compared to humans with 9,000 taste buds, that leaves them with a palate six times inferior to ours. Their taste buds are set on the tip of your pooch's tongue, and they can taste bitter, sweet, sour and salty flavors just like us. Dogs can hear 4 times the distance of a human with normal hearing. Dogs can also hear higher pitched sounds and can detect a frequency range of 67-45,000 Hz, compared to a human range of 64-23,000 Hz. Dogs may hear potential problems that a human is unable to detect. Dogs possess up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to about six million in us. And the part of a dog's brain that is devoted to analyzing smells is, proportionally speaking, 40 times greater than ours. Dogs can smell things buried as far as 40 feet underground! Behavior, breathing, heart rate, and even appearance can all change when your dog is experiencing pain. All or most animals need the sensation of pain to let them know when the body needs extra care. \"Talking\" during sleep is one common characteristic dogs share with humans. If you hear your dog crying or making other noises in his sleep, you've likely caught him dreaming about something that happened earlier that day or about things dogs typically do. Dogs can experience brain-related disorders that can result in psychotic behavior. Pups, like humans, can develop mental illnesses that can impede their ability to live healthy, happy lives. Dogs will have all of the basic emotions: joy, fear, anger, disgust, and, yes, love, but the dog does not experience the more complex emotions like guilt, pride, and shame. Actually, for guilt, I have seen this when a dog is playing and accidentally bites someone very hard. The dog may sulk with guilt for days! Dogs can read a lot from a human's face, according to recent research. For one thing, they rely on seeing a face to tell whether a person is their guardian or a stranger. I watched a program on TV where a dog had been trained to identify over 120 different toy dolls associated with English words. The trainer could say \u201cGo get the Duck!\u201d and the dog would get the toy duck doll. An experimenter came to see the dog. He put ten different toys behind the living room couch and asked the dog to go get one doll after another and he did it correctly each and every time. This could be just stimulus response. But, the experimenter brought a doll of Albert Einstein and put it behind the couch with ten other dolls. Then, when the dog was in front of him, he said \u201cGo get Albert Einstein!.\u201d The dog at first, went to look behind the couch and came back to the experimenter, looked at him for some time, then went back again to look at the dolls behind the couch. Finally, the dog selected the Albert Einstein doll and brought it to the experimenter. Is this some kind of reasoning? A border collie called Chaser has been taught the names of 1022 items which is more than any other animal. Chaser is able to do some impressively complex commands such as combining three verbs with three nouns. She understands the verbs \u201cnose,\u201d \u201cget\u201d and \u201cpaw.\u201d Is the ability to use verbs a complex thought process. There also is Koko the gorilla that training began at the age of 1, and she was able to use more than 1,000 signs of American Sign Language, including giving people the finger. I have seen many examples of animals ability to communicate. To me, being able to communicate is much more than stimulus response. For example, horses may be able to communicate in over 100 different ways by using body language, sounds, ear turning, touching or bumping, and body posture. Dogs communication when information is sent to other dogs. There also is an exchange of information between dogs and humans. How do dogs communicate? They use eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture and gustatory communication. Humans may communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals, body posture and touch. Dogs seem to be the only animal that knows when humans point at something, that something is important. I visited two different friends today and each had a dog that came up to me, one had a tennis ball and other a toy rubber bone. I \u201chad to\u201d toss the toy for them! They were able to communicate with me. Dogs greatly exceed humans in both smell and sound. Dogs may have thoughts but we generally think in words. I do not know how a dog would think. Many people on Quora say they can think without words. But, finding the Albert Einstein doll took some kind of thought. Because of our extensive language, humans would have a much richer and deeper thoughts than any other animal. With language and creativity, humans are able to make tools and with those tools we are able to build material objects with each of these involving some type of qualia or consciousness. ",

            "answer_text": "In his landmark essay, \u201cWhat is it Like to be a Bat?\u201d, Thomas Nagel speculates that it may be impossible to know how another being experiences the world. That is, we cannot definitively say how different the consciousness of other people is from our own, let alone nonhuman animals. That said, there\u2019s quite a bit that can be inferred from modern cognitive science. For instance, behavioral neuroscience indicates that our feelings of love and attachment are similar to what animals feel. To wit: the oxytocin and vasopressin neurotransmitters that underlie much of our pair-bonding and prosocial behaviors also exist in other mammals and typically drive behaviors that we recognize as similar. For example, the timing of oxytocin release suggests that our pet dogs feel a similar prosocial bond to us as we feel to them. Most of our consciousness comes from our cerebral cortex - the wrinkled outer layer of the brain that controls many aspects of planning, awareness, and personality. Other aspects of consciousness come from the limbic system that controls functions pertinent to emotion and memory. Our limbic systems are larger but not especially more complex than those of other primates. Presumably primates and, to some extent, other mammals, have very similar emotional experiences to ours. Our cerebral cortices are significantly larger than all but a handful of other mammals (i.e. except very big animals like elephants and whales), and this is thought to be the source of our problem solving, planning, and abstraction abilities. This includes the use of productive language (understanding/producing speech and reading/writing), which is almost completely absent in other animals. I think that this is the big difference in our consciousness from that of other animals. The use of symbolic reasoning and language give linguistically fluent humans (humans who are fluent in at least one language) a unique ability: arbitrary recursion. We can make and group symbols and arrange them into higher-level concepts. For instance, we can easily classify some activities as sports, some activities as games, and some activities as competitions and easily recognize the differences and overlaps between these three definitions in a fairly discrete way. And, furthermore, we can recognize this distinction as a generalized one (e.g. Venn diagrams illustrating category overlap). And our cortical ability to grasp abstraction and metaphor translate down to the lower emotional levels of consciousness. For example, if you hold a warm beverage in one hand when you\u2019re introduced to a person, you are more likely to describe them as having a \u201cwarm personality\u201d! I doubt very much that you\u2019d see such concept creep among non-linguistic animals. I think our experiences are a lot like those of other animals, but that our unique cognitive and behavioral abilities give us a different side to our awareness: we can abstract and contextualize our behaviors in a way that other animals cannot. While there is most definitely something going on upstairs in our fellow mammals (and, quite probably, birds and a great many other animals), they don\u2019t experience the world quite as we do. I think our experiences are richer in a great many ways, but probably improverished in a few, as well. Consider, for instance, our olfactory (smell) senses. For many mammals - rodents, especially - olfaction drives their sensory world. The olfactory bulbs of a rat are massively larger (in proportion to their brain size) than ours and those bulbs project extensively to their limbic system. In contrast, we (and other primates) have many more visual projections to this system. Thus, it seems appropriate to speculate that the sense of smell in a rat has a much greater emotional complexity than it does in humans, whereas our visual senses are incomparably richer than theirs. Thus, on the basis of neuroanatomy and functional neuroscience, I think it\u2019s safe to say that our conscious experiences aren\u2019t identical to those of nonhuman animals, but there\u2019s quite a bit of room for overlap.

I can only know what my own subjective experience is like. Having said that we can make some reasonable broad assumptions. There is not likely to be some flavour of conscious experience that is common throughout the animal kingdom, all species are different and all individuals within a species vary and each individual\u2019s conscious experience varies with time. The conscious experience I was having whilst dreaming last night is very different in nature to the conscious experience I am having right now. My experience is different with alcohol compared to that when sober. Having got that out the way, I\u2019ll take a stab at answering, and say that the most distinguishing aspect of consciousness in humans as opposed to other animals is a greater and richer persistent sense of self; this underpins our notions of personhood, individuality and moral responsibility. We have a compelling sense of there being a person \u2018inside\u2019 us, a feeling so strong it has given rise in all traditional cultures to the notion of a soul. some immaterial being with agency permanently resident inside, yet somehow distinct from the body which incorporates it. This, I think, would be the hallmark of the distinctive way consciousness has evolved in humans. ",

Yes, language is important, and it\u2019s hard to talk about human vs animal language without acknowledging other factors. Our anatomy and expressiveness, our superior memory, the fact that we\u2019ve developed written language to improve on oral traditions. Oh, and our fingers. Oh, and we developed cooking so we spend little time hunting and eating. Oh, and our brains are big, and that affected childbearing. Oh and that\u2019s related, hip-wise, to walking upright. And bearing helpless children affects culture. And\u2026 It does on and on. There are many factors, most of which are necessary, and some of which probably explain why \u201creal\u201d humans are very recent.

But human beings have language based on grammar, which permits a great elaboration of symbolic reasoning, its recording in tradition and in writing, and its use to elaborate social and political structures that extend beyond the clan. This highly ramified social structure is mirrored within self-consciousness by means, once again, of symbolic thought, and this truly is what separates our consciousness from that of animals, some of which are quite quick on the uptake. Our instincts, which we are conscious of as feelings and urges, including fear, hunger, anger, friendship, desire for mates, and even religious awe, charge these symbolic structures and thoughts with intimate meaning. So unlike other animals, we experience instinct, except for panic and rage, only through the prism of intellect. ",

Energy driven evolution theory shows that all form and function in the universe is about the efficient use of energy, human consciousness seems to be able to transfer to a new host in some circumstances this is probably not due to a difference in consciousness itself but rather because of the host difference. Humans are the only life form that is an energy waster due to an evolutional brain fault that blocks natural selection this may give some form of attraction to the consciousness of a dead host to a new host, I await for science to prove and add to my best guessing but applied in practice this theory works wonders in reducing anxiety and increasing energy efficiency.
