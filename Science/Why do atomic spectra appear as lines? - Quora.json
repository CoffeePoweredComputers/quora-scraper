            "answer_text": "The instruments generating the results work like a prism.  So, the concentration of photons at 420nm, then 680nm, or such, would show as different distances = the angle of deflection. That is a direct correlation = wavelength > angle of deflection. ",

            "answer_text": "The lines in atomic spectra are images of the slit used to view the light source. The slit is a line, so the spectra shows up as lines. If the slit were a circle (a pinhole) then the spectra would look like circles. ",
