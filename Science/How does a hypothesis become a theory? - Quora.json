            "answer_text": "A hypothesis is untested and subjective. It is how I think something might be. A theory is tested, and objective. It is how anyone can confirm something to be, now or even in the future. Hypotheses become theories with proper evidence. A hypothesis \"X is Y\" starts as an intuition that is backed by the person who had it, also making it subjective. Once we gather evidence from nature and find that indeed \"X is Y\", we now have nature backing our statements, at which point we have arrived at some degree of truth. Now nature is saying \"X is Y\" and nature is objective. Evidence flips statements from subjective to objective, from maybe to true, and from personal to universal. It's a process of transcendence through axiomatization. And once a given statement about nature is axiomatized, it does not matter what anyone thinks. There is no more thinking, because the evidence has spoken. These axioms can then be fed into mathematical equations and logically analyzed to see what other truths can be derived, and how they relate with the rest of the objective universe. It's worth noting that a hypothesis is a guess of any type. We can guess facts, events, as well as theories, and not all hypothesizing is done in the form of elaborate theories. Theories are often sophisticated models that are built and refined so that they can be made to be as accurate and as broadly applicable as possible. Much hypothesizing can go into a theory, and they are not necessarily a one to one correlation. ",

            "answer_text": "A hypothesis is a relatively narrow proposal that you want to test. Like, \u201cWhen we change the environmental conditions, do these particular flowers change over time to adapt?\u201d Then you design an experiment to test the hypothesis. Then you conduct the experiment, study the results and present all this to other scientists to examine or even replicate your experiment. That experiment you did may raise a bunch of other questions, like why and how did the flowers adapt or not adapt, or could anything else have influenced your results? Scientists may do other experiments to test that and other scientists may conduct experiments intended to find solutions to keeping the flowers from becoming extinct (applied science). The results of many such experiments may come together to form a theory, which is an explanation of how larger phenomena function or operate. Like, \u201cWe know species evolve over time to adapt to their environment. We have a lot of studies that support this, including one looking at flowers.\u201d A theory is subject to refinement, revision or even rejection as scientists develop more experimental data. Some people see it as a sign of weakness when scientists change their minds about things and revise or toss out theories, but it\u2019s one of the strengths of the scientific method. ",
