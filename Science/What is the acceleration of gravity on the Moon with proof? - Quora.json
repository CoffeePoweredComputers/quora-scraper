            "answer_text": "Not sure what you would cal proof. This if from Wikipedia with references. The acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the Moon is about 1.625 m/s2, about 16.6% that on Earth's surface or 0.166 \u0261. Over the entire surface, the variation in gravitational acceleration is about 0.0253 m/s2 (1.6% of the acceleration due to gravity). Because weight is directly dependent upon gravitational acceleration, things on the Moon will weigh only 16.6% (\u2248 1/6) of what they weigh on the Earth. Gravitation of the Moon - Wikipedia ",
