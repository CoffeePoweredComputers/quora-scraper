            "answer_text": "It won\u2019t unless air gets under it, but that happens very easily. Soap is a film-forming substance when dissolved in water. Under conditions where air bubbles get into water, usually as the air rises to the surface, the water dome on top of it breaks and falls into the rest of the water below. When a film-forming substance is present in the water, as the solution drains into the rest of the water, it is prevented from breaking completely by a film that forms as the dome of liquid gets very thin, and the air is trapped in that space. The film is formed by molecules of soap that migrate to both surfaces of the water facing the air. They are prevented from reaching the same dilution as in the rest of the water because they tend to aggregate, the rest of the water being pulled away from them. So the concentration of soap in the liquid of the bubble is much greater than that in the rest of the soap-water. This is actually a useful property of the soap when taking a shower \u2014 I see \u201cShowering\u201d in the topics list \u2014 because it means the lather won\u2019t run off you quickly, and therefore a good deal of soap is trapped in a small amount of water on your skin and hair.

            "answer_text": "I make soap. It is a chemical process where you mix sodium hydroxide with oils(I use vegetable oils); but animal oils can be used as well. When you mix these two things together you create a process called saponification, basically making soap. Certain oils help create bubbles. For example Coconut, and castor create nice big creamy bubbles. Olive oil makes smaller bubbles. Commercial soap makers add synthetic foamers. Sugar can also be added, and that too helps with the bubbles. ",
