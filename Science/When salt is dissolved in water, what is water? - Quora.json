            "answer_text": "It may be a salt solution \u2026 also called brine .. Water can dissolve salt because the positive part of water molecules attracts the negative chloride ions and the negative part of water molecules attracts the positive sodium ions. The amount of a substance that can dissolve in a liquid (at a particular temperature) is called the solubility of the substance Water molecules pull the sodium and chloride ions apart, breaking the ionic bond that held them together. After the salt compounds are pulled apart, the sodium and chloride atoms are surrounded by water molecules, as this diagram shows. Once this happens, the salt is dissolved, resulting in a homogeneous solution\u2026. ",
