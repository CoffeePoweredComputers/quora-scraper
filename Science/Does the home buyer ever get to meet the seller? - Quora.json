            "answer_text": "My husband and I have bought three houses, and sold two (we're still living in house #3, although it's currently on the market). My husband met the sellers of our first house at the walk-through, which happens just before the actual closing, while I stayed at home with the new baby. We moved to a different town, and were living there when we sold that house, so we never met the buyers. For our second house, we met the sellers numerous times because it was a new build, and they were the builders. (We ended up becoming good friends with one of them.) When we sold that house, I am sorry to say that the buyer was an obnoxious, pushy jerk, and I made a point of avoiding any and all contact with him. For the house we are now in, we ended up meeting the sellers after we had a contract (but pre-closing). We went to dinner with them once, and exchanged Christmas cards for a few years afterward. That said, I think our last two experiences with the sellers were unusual, at least where we live. People in our area tend to have outsized egos, and from experience I prefer having our realtor serve as a buffer between us and any potential buyers during this process. I personally think an arm's length transaction, at least during the negotiations process, is the best way to go. During the negotiations process, you get a good sense for the type of person you're dealing with on the other side, even if you don't see them in person. (And you get a lot of feedback from your Realtor, too.) Let's just say that there have been times that buffer has been very, very helpful. So, the short answer is: it depends. ",

            "answer_text": "It is entirely possible that the buyer and seller may never meet. For example, the buyer or seller may simply not be in town, in which case they will typically give their real estate attorney a power of attorney to execute contracts on their behalf. In NYC today, the closing process still requires an in-person \u201cclosing\u201d meeting where all parties meet and physically sign documents (e-signatures are not valid for NYC property closings as of this writing). As a result, most home buyers and sellers in NYC will physically meet at least once at the closing. If a seller is selling their own home in NYC \u201cFor Sale By Owner,\u201d or FSBO, then the seller will typically meet the home buyer during an open house or private showing. In NYC, it\u2019s required to have a real estate attorney for the closing process since the purchase contract is customizable and more complex than the standard forms used elsewhere in the United States.

            "answer_text": "There are no fixed rules for or against it. Often times the seller could be at home when the buyers are first viewing and they would meet. Some buyers like to accompany the inspectors and some sellers prefer to be home during the inspection, and so the parties could meet. Usually at the closing, it is more convenient to have both parties present. Having both parties meet can have its positive and negative repercussions though. At a closing I once had, the seller mentioned how happy she and her late husband of 54 years marriage had in the house. When she mentioned that the husband loved the place so much that he refused to move out and eventually died in the master suite, my buyer nearly cancelled the closing. She was convinced by us to close, but only reluctantly, and swore that she would not be sleeping in the room. A few months later I visited her and she was buying furnishings for the room and deciding to sleep there. ",
