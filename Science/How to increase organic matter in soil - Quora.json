            "answer_text": "Hello, easiest is to put organic matter in . it depends on what is the size of field / garden, where are you located and what do you have at disposal / can purchase cheap, and what do you want to grow. In most of Europe you are allowed to gather leaves in autumn in forests ( Your forest of course), else its rather cheap to purchase straw ( wheat leftovers) and just bury it into soil mechanically. much better is ot get manure ( for gardens best is horseshit and chicken shit - provided you are ready to have stench around for few days , and chicken eat regular food, not manure from mass chicken farming\u2026 You can also bury hay in the ground, but that will result in grass and weed (not the kind you would like to get stoned with) growing as hay usually contains ripe seeds. Also great source of slow releasing organic are wood chips, or even branches, but that takes a bit o different procedure\u2026 In some areas it\u2019s also legal to gather soil from forests and put it into garden\u2026 but that is hard labour - maybe the hardest . For example: for garden I would remove top layer of soil ( 1 shovel deep - 20 cm / 7 inches) and put first layer of chips 5 cm thick, 10 cm of hay, and 5 cm of mixed manure - mix all kind you can get. then return the soil. in 2 years time, you will gave perfect soil - just mind acid levels.. For large farming areas, probably only reasonable solution is combination of slurry from animal farm and straw, and then plow it.. I hope this helped, else reply with specifics. Good luck, Gasper ",
