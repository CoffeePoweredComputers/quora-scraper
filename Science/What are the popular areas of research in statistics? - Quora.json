            "answer_text": "Educational Preparation Data Science You should get a firm foundation in statistical inference, statistical modeling, statistical learning and data mining, and statistical analysis. These all get qualified by statistics, in the sense that actual data informs the work. Because data appears in large amounts on modern computers, you should also develop a facility with programming, databases, and artificial intelligence. This collection of coursework presents the modern development in data science. Theoretical Statistics But you can take a traditional approach. You can get a mathematics foundation, and then study the pure areas of statistics. This includes sampling and theory, experiments and design, measure theory and probability, frequentist and bayesian inference, and mathematical statistics and analysis. These present terms in parallel with modern statistics and mathematics departments. This study would qualify you for doctoral level statistics. Decision Analysis However you choose your ground, you need preparation for research in statistics. You can take an applied approach focused more on the practice and collaboration with different disciplines, or you can take the pure approach and study areas of statistics that overlap with mathematics and the subject in its own right. If you choose the latter, you need to develop statistics knowing that it only has a few hundred years of learning and in this sense its identity has not yet fully realized. The kinds of research you can do in statistics include intersections with applied mathematics and modeling physical, social, or human systems. Any addition of uncertainty in these kinds of models warrant the use and application of theoretical statistics as interpreted in the relevant domain. Reasonable Research Areas Statistics and Natural Science You can explore the intersection of statistics and biology in genetics, biomedical data science, or statistical mechanics applied to genetic theory. The last piece suggests a possible relation between these two disciplines. You can explore physics and statistics and study quantum mechanical systems with theoretical statistics, to model such particles in a random way and the justified space. Statistics and Business You can explore business and statistics in many ways, that include administration and descriptive statistics, inference on financial records, actuarial applications, or financial modeling. The last deals with investment and risk management. Statistics and Economics You can explore economics and statistics with calculus based econometrics with the addition of uncertainty, and apply various statistical learning to the economic model. This includes any economic model with agents, financial agreements, and markets or whole companies, governments, and law. It also includes macroeconomic models with key resources, supply of utilities, agencies and kinds of produce or service, public policy and law to govern transactions, and demand for goods. The latter bases on a market model, well regulated by laws, and allowance for agents and agencies to transact with currency. Any such microeconomic or macroeconomic model presents the structure for economic activity, and with sufficient statistics organization can support prediction and regulation of high risk events. Conclusion Personal Recommendation You need to meet your faculty, students, staff, and department at your chosen university. The approach to research requires a good foundation in education that makes sense for your short term research goal. This makes your application to the doctoral program easier, sensible, and a risk managed investment. You can also continue to your next post-doctoral, faculty, or research position easier. Practical Direction As you make your way to research in statistics, you just need to get all the relevant education and experience, work with the right people, and then make research proposals. You call the latter research grant writing, research studies, and research for publication. ",
