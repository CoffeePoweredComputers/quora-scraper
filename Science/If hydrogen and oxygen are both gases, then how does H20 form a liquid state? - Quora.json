            "answer_text": "Water molecules are strongly attracted to each other, so they remain condensed (that is, a liquid, and not a gas) at higher temperatures. Dihydrogen and dioxygen have no strong attractive forces to hold the molecules together, so they exist as gases at room temperature and pressure (that is, in our everyday lives). Hope it helps. And do leave comments. ",
