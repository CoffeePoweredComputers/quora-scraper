            "answer_text": "I'm going to say hydrogen Why you say ? Here's why We are more than 70% water . Plants are dependant on water and so too is all life on this planet . This water is named Di Hydrogen Monoxide Di meaning 2 mono 1 This is a picture of it .  Notice there are two hydrogen atoms & one oxygen atom .That makes a 2:1 ratio next to oxygen . Ok some might say carbon is the most consumed . But most / all food is made of Hydrocarbons some is called carbohydrates notice the Hydro part of this name mixed with the carbon or carbo . The reason is , this food has water in it . If it's not water it's named hydrocarbons or oil alcohol fat . It all has hydro/ water . For example here is good old vodka Or ethanol C2H5OH let's look at that for a second . There are 2 carbons 6 hydrogen and one oxygen. But this is not sold or drank like this it will be mixed in a watery solution to dilute it . And then mixed again from botyle to glass with a mixer full of more water . Probably full of sugar . Sugar a carbohydrate one of them is called glucose it looks like this C6H12O6 . That's 6 carbons , 12 hydrogen and 6 oxygen Notice the ratio for hydrogen an oxygen stay the same as water in this Hydro carbon. And just for fun this is a fatty acid C18H32O2 part of a cooking oil mixture . Also notice that these 3 simple foods are much higher in hydrogen than carbon . All food is like this . And all food is constructed with water surrounding these products .Unless you eat dried toast with sugar sprinkles and straight ethanol ( you'd be dead in 3 days ) Oh and on top of that don't forget the massively disproportionate amount of water to water filled food, when you drink in your 8 glasses of water a day If you don't believe . Search for the chemical composition of the food you think has more carbon than hydrogen . Then think about how it is actually eaten . I.E A health supplement Pure black activated carbon capsules . Take one with a glass of water. Ok 2.5 CC of pure carbon just got consumed with 250cc of water .100 times more water . 2/3 of it Hydrogen. 67 X more hydrogen. . HYDROGEN it's the answer ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question! My knee-jerk response is oxygen, of course! We consume oxygen with every breath! If we stop consuming oxygen, we\u2019ve got about 90 seconds of consciousness and about 3 minutes left to live, give or take. But hear me out: is oxygen the most abundant element in terms of sheer number of atoms consumed? And that\u2019s hard to say! I\u2019m going to make some assumptions and see where they lead. The chemical make-up of your body is more-or-less constant, at least among the top five elements or so. You\u2019re not likely to see a shake-up in the top slots (and still be alive to tell about it, anyway).The chemical make-up of the consumables you put in your body (air, water, food) is probably about the same as the chemical make-up of your body. If you were ingesting one element at a far greater rate than any others, that element would have a greater representation in your body chemistry than any other elements.So it stands to reason that the most abundant elements in your body are also probably also the elements you consume most frequently. And as it turns out, we know which elements those are.By mass, the most abundant element in the average human body is indeed oxygen. That\u2019s not terribly surprising: not only do we inhale oxygen from the air, but it\u2019s part of the water we drink, and also a large part of the food we eat. But by atom, the most abundant element in our bodies is hydrogen. Take a look at this chart:  SOURCE: Chemical Elements of the Human Body Suppose your body has a mass of 70 kilograms (about 154 pounds). 65.0% of your body mass is oxygen, or about 45.5 kilograms of oxygen. Doing a few quick conversions: [math]45.5 \\text{ kg oxygen} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1000 \\text{ g}}{1 \\text{ kg}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1 \\text{ mol oxygen}}{16.00 \\text{ g oxygen}}\\right) = 2840\\text{ mol oxygen}[/math] 18.5% of your body mass is carbon, or about 13.0 kilograms of carbon in a 70 kilogram body. [math]13.0 \\text{ kg carbon} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1000 \\text{ g}}{1 \\text{ kg}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1 \\text{ mol carbon}}{12.01 \\text{ g carbon}}\\right) = 1080\\text{ mol carbon}[/math] 9.5% of your body is hydrogen, or about 6.7 kilograms of hydrogen in a 70 kilogram body. [math]6.7 \\text{ kg hydrogen} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1000 \\text{ g}}{1 \\text{ kg}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1 \\text{ mol hydrogen}}{1.01 \\text{ g hydrogen}}\\right) = 6600\\text{ mol hydrogen}[/math] 3.2% of your body is nitrogen, or about 2.2 kilograms of nitrogen in a 70 kilogram body. [math]2.2 \\text{ kg nitrogen} \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1000 \\text{ g}}{1 \\text{ kg}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\dfrac{1 \\text{ mol nitrogen}}{14.01 \\text{ g nitrogen}}\\right) = 160\\text{ mol nitrogen}[/math] So there you have it. By mass, oxygen is by far the most abundant element in our body (and therefore, one assumes, the element we absorb the most of by mass). But in terms of sheer number of atoms, hydrogen has a hefty lead over any other element. Because of its small atomic weight, it doesn\u2019t dominate in the mass category, but it\u2019s present in so many organic molecules (as well as in water), and in such high ratios, that it only makes sense we would consume a huge number of hydrogen atoms in our daily activities.
