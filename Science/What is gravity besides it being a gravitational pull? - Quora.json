            "answer_text": "Positive mass/ matter, and energy wishes always to accelerate to light speed. This black hole/ singularity is the resting point of positive matter. All positive matter is always on its way back to light speed. That is what gravity really is. Every galaxy in the universe no matter where you are looking is accelerating back to light speed. In the end, all matter/ mass and energy in the universe reaches light speed again. That is the purpose of gravity, first there is a reduction of speed, hence the universe, space and time is created. Then there is a speeding up again, and the universe ends up as a point like singularity again. This is the purpose of gravity, matter/ mass and energy pulsating between zero speed and light speed. This is like a point expanding to a gigantic sphere, and then returns back to a point like singularity again. The energy, and forces that makes this happen is gravity. It is like coil spring that is forced apart, and then returns to its resting position. It is dark energy that pulls this metaphorically coil spring apart. Dark energy is then accumulated for a new pull when the positive mass returns to light speed. Exactly when positive matter/ mass touches light speed, the accumulated dark energy relishes it\u2019s repulsive forces, and thereby acts as a gigantic break on the universe. Speeding down the universe in all directions at once, makes the universe expand outwardly to a gigantic sphere. Actually the first part of this expansion happens hyper fast due to reversed lenght contraction. Not in one direction, but in all spherically and spatially directions at once, hence hyper fast expansion way faster than light speed. ",

            "answer_text": "Gravity actually can be thought of as \u201cdents\u201d in space-time. The common analogy is that of a trampoline. The surface of the trampoline represents space-time. If you put a bowling ball in the center (like the sun), then smaller balls that you try to roll past it will roll around it instead. Why do we clarify that the surface refers to \u201cspace-time\u201d? Because time moves differently relative to how much \u201cstuff\u201d is surrounding. If two twins were separated at birth - one living in the mountains, and one living at sea level - the one living in the mountains will have experienced more time than the one living at sea level. To be clear, I\u2019m not talking about how time appears to be flowing. You could give an extremely accurate clock to both twins, and the clock of the twin who is in the mountains will register a later time. Time moves slower the closer you are to a lot of stuff. This gets very interesting when we start talking about black holes, where there is a lot of stuff in very little space. Basically, if you were caught in a black hole, the universe would age very quickly around you while your experience of time would slow down almost to a standstill. (Forgive me all the writers I plagiarized in writing this answer). So what is gravity? It is the effect that a bowling ball has in the middle of the trampoline of space-time. ",
