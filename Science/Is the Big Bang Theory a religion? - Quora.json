            "answer_text": "In some ways, the Big Bang theory looks to me like a religious dogma. I have a lot of respect for the accomplishments of the modern cosmology , but the unproven theory of a big bang out of singularity followed by an inflation is not a part of it. I am far from being alone. For example, not so long ago ,a group of 33 scientists published: \u201cThe Big Bang today relies on a growing number of hypothetical entities-things we have never observed- inflation, dark matter and dark energy are the most prominent examples. The successes claimed by the theory supporters consist of its ability to retrospectively fit observations with a steadily increasing array of adjustable parameters, just as the old Earth centered cosmology of Ptolemy needed a layer upon layer of epicycles. Conforming scientists had been inventing for about a thousand of years more and more absurd theories \u201cproving\u201d that the planets orbit the Earth. I have said almost the same in Quora before but this time I will expand and include a very simple calculation to support a more realistic theory, not invented by me but supported by many critical thinkers -without violating laws of physics as the Big Bang does. Why do some contemporary physicists rely only on mathematical solutions,ignore the observed data and sometimes arrive at absurd conclusions? Examples: The 400 billion of the observed galaxies ,within the observable radius of 42 billion years must be \u201claughing\u201d at the statement that they all originate from zero space. Take some time and imagine what the above enormous and mind challenging numbers really mean. Singularity and inflation are mathematical fantasies never observed in the real world. Hopefully this dogma does not last as long as the epicycles did and that young scientists will not have to worry anymore to disagree with the mainstream Big Bang. Most critical thinkers I know agree that the young universe was probably smaller and hotter, but reject the big bang explanation. There is a lot of credible observation supporting the existence of black holes, but how is the mass distributed inside we can only speculate. No need for a singularity. A large enough compacted mass simply prevents light to escape, perhaps in accordance with the Schwarzschild radius. The conclusion by the mainstream physicists that the energy of a cubic centimeter of vacuum is 10e116eV and not the observable10e-4eV (electron volts) -a 120 exponential magnitude difference-is also very shocking. The same scientists estimate the energy of the known universe as 10e 89 eV.Much more energy in a sugar cube size of a vacuum than in the whole universe?? Max Planck solved the paradox of the unlimited black body radiation more than a century ago.I hope the solution for the vacuum energy paradox is around the corner. As an engineer I have worked with very small and very large science numbers, such as h=6.6x10e-34 or half life of U238 at 4.5 billion years- but I still find the vaccum estimate unreal. Mathematics can solve some relatively simple tasks like landing a probe on Mars, but cannot even closely predict the next decay of a single nucleus (now or in 2 billion years?) and even less so the behaviour of a single living cell. Or the microscopic beginning of the universe! Back to my problems with the Big Bang Theory: The theory could not explain the uniformity of the CMB (cosmic microwave background) and the flatness of the universe. To help out, Alan Guth proposed the very brief inflation of the very early universe which could of course never be observed. To explain the lack of matter in the universe, the dark matter had to be invented. To explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, the dark energy had to be invented. Both are still only speculative entities. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe started rapidly expanding out of singularity, at something like 10e-35seconds after the big bang. At10e-6 seconds all quarks and gluons of the known universe were formed- the matter of my body included? WHERE DID THE ENERGY AND INFORMATION COME FROM- IN A MILLIONTH OF A SECOND? THIS IS RELIGIOUS FANTASY, NOT SCIENCE. Even the \u201calmighty\u201d God needed 6 days to create the infinitely smaller Earth. (Don\u2019t \u201cworry\u2019, I have been an atheist all my life.) Religions and Big Bang have the same answer when challenged: galaxies are here, so are you, it proves that our theory is right\u2026 THE PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE TO BIG BANG: I arrived at these conclusions by myself, and so did many others. I hope that my very simple math can explain an obvious alternative to zero space at the beginning of the universe.) The available information: Mass of the known universe: 10e53kg Mass of the neutron/proton:1.67x10e-27kg Mass density of a neutron/proton:10e18kg/m3 Mass density of a neutron star: 10e18kg/m3 Volume of a neutron: 2.5x10e-45m3 Billions of years ago, the universe gradually shrinked into a giant neutron star with the volume of 1.5x10e26m3 . Would fit into our solar system. Calculation: 10e53x2,5x10e-45/1.67x10e-27 =1.5x10e35m3 or1.5x10e26km3 of compacted neutrons. It collapsed probably into plasma of quarks and gluons as main ingredients. Like a giant black hole. At a certain time it started expanding - because of Pauli exclusion principle or quantum gravity effects or some unknown conversion of energy. From here on, I partly go with the Big Bang theory, but not on their time scale. No inflation. No such rush. The cycle could take a trillion of years. But I do appreciate the work of cosmology scientists who have observed and explained such dramatic discoveries as billions galaxies,nova stars, or fast spinning neutron stars. Even Einstein would be impressed. There is a possibility that the expanding universe became visible when its size became larger than the Schwarzschild radius. Just something to think about. Nobody knows why is the universe expanding and when the expansion might slow down or reverse. We do not understand gravity when galaxies are billions of light years apart. Some scientists are working on modified gravity (MOG). This proposal does not violate the known physics laws. It is easy to accept that the universe has been around all the time, no beginning , no end, only cycling and conversion of energy. We need more well funded research into other options rather than the worn out Big Bang theory with its singularity, inflation and expansion forever. I also think that the GR mathematics is not a suitable tool to explain the microscopic beginning of the universe. I see some logic in the Big Bang interpretation of the CMB(cosmic microwave background) But the CMB might also be just the light which has travelled from the most distant stars through gasses and dust of the universe and has lost the energy the same way. All I am hoping to accomplish with my little contribution is to encourage a more open minded research. So, the search for more knowledge about the universe continues. We may have some time left-our sun has enough of nuclear fuel for some 5 billion years. The humanity is facing so many real problems-so why to argue about what might have happened billions of years ago? We will never know for sure. But the more I know about the the enormous, cold and hot and harsh universe, the more I love our beautiful and friendly planet. ",

            "answer_text": "Is the Big Bang Theory a religion? No, it is a television sitcom. But if you are referring to the standard cosmological model (usually called in the literature the concordance model or the Lambda-CDM model), it is a mathematical model of the expanding universe based on fundamental theories including general relativity, quantum field theory (specifically, the so-called Standard Model of particle physics, which is a quantum field theory of all known particles and interactions except gravity) and thermodynamics. As the concordance model is an expanding universe model, yes, it is sometimes referred to as a Big Bang type cosmology but it is not usually called \u201cBig Bang theory\u201d in the actual scientific literature. That expression is used mostly in popularizations. Like any good scientific model, the concordance model presents testable predictions with respect to the outcome of observations or experiments. The expanding universe scenario was originally based on just one set of observations: the distance-redshift relationship of distant galaxies. The model, however, successfully predicted a number of very specific observables that have since been verified by astronomers. These include the existence of a cosmic microwave background radiation, its blackbody spectrum, its statistical fluctuations, the statistics of the large-scale distribution of matter in the universe, the ratios of primordial isotopes, or the morphology and chemistry of distant, infant galaxies, just to name a few. These observations also help narrow down the ranges of the model\u2019s free parameters (e.g., the Hubble parameter of the expansion, or the presumed ratios of ordinary matter, dark matter and dark energy.) As such, the \u201cBig Bang theory\u201d is a bona fide scientific theory that can be validated or falsified through observing Nature.  I thank my generous supporters on Patreon.
