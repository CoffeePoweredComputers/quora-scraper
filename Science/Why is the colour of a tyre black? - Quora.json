            "answer_text": "The black color of tires comes from carbon black, a readily-available material that provides greatly improved wear characteristics and heat-dissipation capabilities when added to rubber compounds.    Natural rubber is off-white in color, and in fact the first rubber tires were white.   Pure vulcanized rubber is soft and wears out very quickly, however, and tends to heat up and deform under load.  So you want to mix something in with the rubber that adds temperature stability and hardness -- originally this was typically zinc oxide which made the tires bright white in color.   Around the time of World War I zinc oxide began to be replaced with carbon black, which had even better characteristics and was becoming more available as a byproduct of coal and oil production.  As the benefits of adding carbon black to the compound became known, that additive was used just on the tread portion, while the side of the tire remained the natural color -- this is where the (now mostly gone) tradition of \"whitewall tires\" came from.  In a true (antique) whitewall tire the light color is present througout the wall of the tire; later versions overlaid a thinner layer of white rubber on the black tire to give a whitewall look:     It's possible to make other colors by simply using other pigments in combination with natural white rubber, in fact it has been done:   The above are specialty tires from Double Star Tyre, a Chinese manufacturer, and are mostly intended for show use (these likely use standard plastic pigments along with silica filler -- similar compounds are used for sneaker soles -- this provides good traction but much poorer wear characteristics than carbon black).   A somewhat more mainstream variant is the Scorcher tuner-car tire from BF Goodrich, which has embedded colored bands:    So it's possible to make useful tires with pigmentation other than carbon black.  However no other readily-available filler has been found with the combination of beneficial properties seen in carbon black. There are also practical considerations; colored tires would be harder to keep clean and might tend to clash with the color and style of the car itself -- even if mutiple colors were made and stocked (itself a logistical challenge that would increase prices) there would be many color shade combinations that clashed, while \"black goes with everything\".

            "answer_text": "When our vehicles can be indifferent colours, why the tyres always have to be black? Some would say that black colour is obvious because the tyres go through all sorts of dirt-filled roads; so, it is better to keep them black.While that may seem like a practical point, but is that really the reason behind? Year 1895, tyres were invented and used to come in white! Yes, tyres were not born in black . So, why do they only come in black, even when natural rubber comes in milky white colour? Carbon Black- the main reason! Carbon black is a chemical compound that completely revamped the tyre industry a few decades ago. Why did carbon black come into play? This compound is utilised as a stabilizing chemical. When carbon black is added to rubber, it significantly enhances the durability and strength of the tyres.Without any doubt, we all look for tyres that are both strong and durable in nature. This is why manufacturers started using carbon black, thereby, lending a black colour to tyres. How does carbon black help improve the durability of the tyres? When we drive our car, the tyres get heated up. The belt and the tread areas tend to get hot when we drive our vehicle for too long. If the heat is not dissipated into the surroundings, the tyres will wear out quickly. In fact, it can even cause some serious damage, including tyre-burst. Fortunately, carbon black is quite helpful in maintaining the temperature of the tyres. This enhances tread life and lends durability to the tyre. Carbon black protects tyres from UV rays UV rays are notorious for hardening the rubber compound in the tyres and bringing down their performance. Driving for long hours on the highways leads to prolonged exposure of the tyres to the harmful UV rays. Carbon black prevents tyres from hardening and prolong tyre life. Soot- the initial reason behind black colour Soot is a deep black flaky or powdery substance comprising mainly of carbon. How it is produced?Well, it is produced by burning an organic compound in an incomplete way. The reason why soot was included in the production of tyres is related to the aspect of durability. It was thought that soot adds more durability to the tyre. But, in today\u2019s times, soot has been replaced by carbon black. Conclusion Black tyres may appear boring to some people. But, it is also true that they are certainly easier to clean. From a practical point of view, black tyres are much bette rin comparison to the white ones. For daily driving, nothing can come close to the efficiency, durability, and safety aspect of the black tyres. So, next time when someone asks you why tyres come in black,you know how to answer their question. ",
