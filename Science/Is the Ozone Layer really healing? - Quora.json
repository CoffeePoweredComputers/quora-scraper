            "answer_text": "Yes - and it's not really surprising. I saw several estimates many years ago that the \u201chealing phase\u201d would begin in 2015\u20132017, so 2016 is smack bang in the middle of that window. This confused me, since, at least in my lifetime (born 1996), I had thought that we had solved the ozone problem? Certainly it was not given as much emphasis as my parents had been given! To understand why, we first need to understand what caused the damage. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were chemicals used in many products in the 1980s - from aerosols to fridges and aircon units. However, the chlorine and bromine which dissociated from these CFCs caused \u201cPolar Stratospheric Clouds\u201d - the combination of low temperature and lots of sunlought caused some unexpected photochemistry to occur - which degraded the layer of Ozone in the atmosphere, which protects us from UV radiation. CFCs were banned in 1987 under the Montreal Protocol - so why didn't the healing process begin then? Well, there was still a lot of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere (and other secondary effects such as volcanism continued to add small amounts) - so even though we weren't producing new gases, the old gases were still doing damage. Conditions continued to improve over the next 20 years - as the amount of chemicals in the atmosphere dispersed the rate of growth of the \u201chole\u201d slowed, until it was pretty much constant - and contained over Antarctica. This is why we didn't hear about it much over the past decade or so - the problem was contained, and now it was just a waiting game until the chemicals were depleted, and the ozone started to \u201cfall\u201d back to its original position. We have finally reached this position - the levels of chlorine and bromine are sufficiently low that the natural ozone production of the planet outpaces that of the degradation - and the ozone layer has finally started to heal. There is no reason to doubt that this is the case - we have been predicting this moment pretty much since 1987. The rate of growth has slowed and slowed to a tiny rate - so the fact that it's finally reversed is not at all surprising. ",
