            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s get one thing straight right up front. A human would not have a chance to ENCOUNTER a giant squid in the ocean. No way, nada, zip, zero. Giant squids live in the deepest depths of the sea and only come to the surface when they\u2019re dying. They are so elusive that humans never even saw a healthy, living giant squid until a team managed to film one off the coast of Japan in 2004. That team never even got in the water- a video camera and a special electronic lure meant to mimic a deep sea creature in distress was attached to a long cable which was lowered about two miles deep. The team saw the whole thing from a room on the ship. The team did it again just a few months ago (2019) in the Gulf of Mexico, again lowering the device and camera down to the darkest depths of the Gulf. Now, to answer your question. Before those two videos, the answer would have been \u201cnobody knows\u201d. It was previously hypothesized that giant squids were slow moving scavengers, but the video footage clearly shows they are active hunters. We still don\u2019t know anything about how fast, how strong, or how agile they are, but if I were to place a bet, I would say\u2026. Well, there\u2019s another consideration. Another large squid, the Humboldt Squid, is plentiful off the west coast of North America. These squid are \u201conly\u201d about a meter and a half long, but they are fast, strong, and very aggressive, and can easily overpower divers. There are firms that run cage dives with Humboldt squid, just like shark cage dives. Luckily, they typically live way out in the deep sea and rarely come close to shore, so even they rarely ever encounter people. \u2026So in a match between a person and the literal inspiration for the mighty Kraken, I\u2019d say there\u2019s no way in the world a human breaks free. I think a full grown giant squid would completely smother even the most capable human, and very likely do it without much effort. But seriously, there is nothing to fear. You will never, ever, EVER meet a Giant Squid in real life. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all you have to realize that giant squids do not usually prey on humans for several reasons: they have not developed a taste for the bipedal creatures because the two rarely encounter one another as the squid are deep sea denizens and only come near the surface after dark. Giant squids are also like every other successful sea creature in that they know they need their eyes, their limbs and to be in good condition to survive and to reproduce. When they hunt it is NOT to fight but rather to eat and survive so IF a human has the ability to ATTACK the giant squid when it mistakenly assumes that the human is prey it will more than likely disengage and escape RATHER THAN RISK being injured and unable to survive in its own environment. Having explained that I would suggest that you notice that I stated IF the human has the ability. A swimmer pulled underwater will probably NOT have that ability. ",
