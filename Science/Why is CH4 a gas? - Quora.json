            "answer_text": "Methane has very low intermolecular forces because of this. There are two major forces of attractions that contribute to intermolecuar forces. The first is \"dipole-diplole\" interactions (such as those found in hydrogen bonding) and the second is London forces. There are others, such as induced dipole, but these are two that are usually discussed. The dipole-dipole forces occur between the partial \"-\" charge of one molecule and the partial \"+\" charge of a second. This only occurs in molecules with a permanent dipole moment. The electronegativity of carbon is 2.55 and of hydrogen is 2.20. The difference is 0.35. To qualify as a \"polar covalent\" bond, the difference needs to be between 0.5 and 1.5. Meaning the bond between H and C is NON polar covalent. In addition, methane, CH4, has symmetry. It is a tetrahedral molecule. Meaning the molecule would be non polar even if it had polar bonds. So dipole-dipole intermolecular forces of attraction between methane molecules are non existent. As to London forces, these generally occur between very large usually linear molecules. And they are due to slight variations in electron density that create multiple very slight partial charges. The slight partial + of one molecule is attracted to the slight partial - of a second. These forces generated by these partial charges individually are not very large but when added together over the entire molecule, they create large intermolecular attractions. Methane, being a very small and very NON linear molecule has very little London forces. Since methane has low intermolecular forces of attraction and since the boiling point and intermolecular forces of attraction are directly proporational, therefore methane has a low boiling point. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It is called Methane Gas. When a person farts or opens a sewer manhole, the gas coming out is also Methane, it is also highly inflammable. One can liquify the gas under certain conditions. Now UNC and UW scientists have moved closer to devising a way to convert methane to methanol or other liquids that can easily be transported, especially from the remote sites where methane is often found. . Methane is valued for its high-energy carbon-hydrogen bonds, which consist of a carbon atom bound to four hydrogen atoms. The gas does not react easily with other materials and so it is most often simply burned as fuel. Burning breaks all four hydrogen-carbon bonds and produces carbon dioxide and water. Converting methane into useful chemicals, including readily transported liquids, currently requires high temperatures and a lot of energy. Catalysts that turn methane into other chemicals at lower temperatures have been discovered, but they have proven to be too slow, too inefficient or too expensive for industrial applications. The idea is to turn methane into a liquid in which you preserve most of the carbon-hydrogen bonds so that you can still have all that energy. Two key properties of gases are important in developing methods for their liquefaction: critical temperature and critical pressure. The critical temperature of a gas is the temperature at or above which no amount of pressure, however great, will cause the gas to liquefy. The minimum pressure required to liquefy the gas at the critical temperature is called the critical pressure. In case of methane straight liquefaction is not possible without distortion of Carbon & Hydrogen bonds, that is why it is converted into other forms & then transported. ",
