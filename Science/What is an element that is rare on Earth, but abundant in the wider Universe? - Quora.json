            "answer_text": "The two most abundant elements in the universe are hydrogen and helium and while plentiful across the cosmos are in short supply on Earth.  Our star is composed of roughly 74% hydrogen and 24% helium. When one considers the mass of the Sun, 1.9891 x 1030 kilograms, that is a tremendous volume of both elements. The Sun fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second of every day. Jupiter is made of 88-92% hydrogen and 8-12% helium. For two elements that are common throughout the solar system, Earth has comparatively little of both. Their lightweight enables them to escape the Earth\u2019s gravity. Hydrogen is most often found as a compound such as water. Helium is a noble gas and does not form compounds readily. New helium on Earth is created through the radioactive decay of heavy elements such as thorium and uranium. The alpha particles emitted by decay consists of helium-4 nuclei. Precious metals on Earth are valuable by their scarcity but can be found scattered about the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Theoretically, the asteroids could be harvested to replace spent resources on Earth.  ",

            "answer_text": "The collision of two neutron star, called kilonova, produces gold equivalent to 10 times the mass of Earth. This event was observed by the North America ligo, Gravitational wave detector, in the constellation of Hydra. The name of this kilonova is GW170917 , for further reading. Even if this quantity of gold seems enormous, dispersed in a constellation, quantity would be considered rare compared to other elements. Elements are produced in the Universe by nucleosynthesis, besides hydrogen, where they all come from. The abondance we observe on earth is the reflection of what is in the Universe. Some deviation from this can be seen with radioactive decay. Radio active elements are continuously produced in the Universe. On earth the brake down to stable ones. Example content of carbone 14 once absorbed by living organisme, diminished after death, making C14 datation possible. Earth is continuously bombarded by micrometeorites containing C14, keeping the level constant for living organism. ",
