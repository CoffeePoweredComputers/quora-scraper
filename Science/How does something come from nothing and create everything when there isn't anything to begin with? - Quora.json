            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cHow does everything come from nothing, without there being anything to begin with?\u201d \u2026Short answer: \u201cIt can\u2019t!\u201d Science is the most reliable tool we have for discovering the truth about all that we see and experience from a human perspective. Unfortunately, sometimes even science is at a loss on explaining certain events, happenings and conditions that we know take place within our universe. Science cannot explain gravity, the existence of the human consciousness, what\u2019s happening inside black holes, self-awareness, the origins of life, love, perseverance or even where a single individual thought comes from. One of the greatest mysteries that has boggled history\u2019s most renowned intellectuals and scientists is offering a definitive answer as to how our universe came to be. The two most intellectually-supported quantum theories regarding the origin of our universe are the Big Bang theory and the New Model Quantum Equation. The Big Bang theory proposes that our universe began at a point of singularity. All matter was tightly compressed into a single state of \u201csomethingness\u201d to which a series of expanding and contracting pressures produced a cosmic explosion of universal proportions. What happened before this point of singularity is a complete mystery. The New Model Quantum Equation takes the Big Bang theory one step further and proposes that the universe remains in a constant state of flux with the potential of re-occurring Big Bangs happening throughout infinity. This newer, updated quantum theory attempts to compensate for the Big Bang\u2019s apparent breakdown of the laws of physics right at the point of singularity. Yes, you read that correctly. Science has two diametrically-opposed explanations for the origin of our universe.  Although both of these popular quantum theories offer explanations for how our universe came to be, neither offers an explanation as to where everything came from to start with in order for our universe to ultimately \u201cbe.\u201d So how does science explain something coming from nothing? \u2026You might be surprised at the answer: Science becomes a politician! Science likes to deal with logic and reason. Logic and reason are safe, reliable and repeatable methods for processing data. Anything that does not directly follow logic, the laws of physics and various other governing rules of the universe is considered \u201csupernatural.\u201d Science hates anything that appears to be supernatural and seeks to logically explain its true nature. However, since science cannot explain how one single photon, quark, particle or molecule exists in our universe, it resorts to what politicians do when they are faced with a question they cannot answer\u2026 They marginalize the question! Rather than accept the fact that science is totally baffled on how something can come from nothing, it attempts to re-define what \u201cnothingness\u201d actually is. What science has oddly chosen to do is to sacrifice its cornerstone of logic and reason in behalf of celestial conjecture and semantic sorcery. Science now attempts to convince us that \u201cnothing\u201d isn\u2019t really what we think it is.  \u201cEmpty space is a bubbling brew of virtual particles that are popping in and out of existence at a timescale so short you can\u2019t see them.\u201d - Lawrence Krauss So there you have it! Apparently, \u201cnothing\u201d can have a certain amount of weight, volume, exhibit fluctuations of energy and have exciting little things simultaneously happening within it. \u2026\u2026\u2026..Who knew? Whereas at one time, \u201cNothing\u201d was clearly, accurately and logically defined as, \u201ca condition or state which is void of all things\u201d has now been re-defined as an apparent \u201csomething\u201d that has a measurable weight, volume and a litany of \u201cvirtual somethings\u201d that spontaneously appear and disappear within it.  Since science cannot explain how something comes from nothing, it forwards a curious new definition of what certain \u201csomethings\u201d are and summarily declares them as being a byproduct of \u201cnothing.\u201d However, for the rest of us non-quantum-theory-savvy people, \u201cnothing\u201d is still defined as being empty, void of anything and everything that exists. Nothing cannot be something and something cannot be nothing. They are mutually-exclusive. Where one is found, the other cannot be! You cannot take \u201cnothingness\u201d and have something magically appear within it and then claim that it came form nothing because this \u201cnothingness\u201d was actually made up of these \u201csomething(s)\u201d all along. \u2026A Creationists might humorously regard this type of thinking as the, \u201cScience of the Gaps.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Two possible solutions at least exist, in my opinion. Again.. ;-) First, scientifically it's perfectly possible for absolutely nothing becoming something. One solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation says space, time, matter and energy (i.e. primordial quantum stuff) can come into existence from absolutely nothing, where nothing means totally, completely, ultimate nothing, without time, space, spacetime, matter, energy, etc. This form of absolutely nothing is unstable, hence unavoidably will decay into something.  (With energy below Planck scale:)  https://www.georgeshiber.com/spontaneous-quantum-to-classical-cosmological-collapse-dynamics/ A second possibility, though it could be very well combined with the above, I worked out myself almost 10 years ago (apparently not the only one ;-)), as a possible explanation for the missing anti-matter, saying the Big Bang went into opposite directions, creating a universe and an anti-universe simultaneously. A mirror universe where time is running backwards, filled with anti-matter. When seen as one universe, the total energy level will be zero, the same as before the Big Bang, so no energy law is violated, where the same counts for the second law of thermodynamics. The unstable nothing fel apart into two directions, with the same amount of matter and anti-matter, keeping everything perfectly balanced. Since the real endpoint of this mirror universe is our beginning (i.e. the Big Bang) and vice versa, which may sound like an oxymoron, technically both universes retroactively created each other, forming an infinite closed loop, also holding each others future, present and past, with a certain degree of uncertainty.  With the interaction between them (or seen as one universe pulsing in real and imaginary time) behaving like for example D-Branes, like in String Theory (or M-theory or K-theory), causing the weird quantum behavior, vacuum polarizations, etc., but possibly phenomena like dark matter and dark energy as well..
