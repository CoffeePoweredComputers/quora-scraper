            "answer_text": "All the answers so far are very good and answer the question with a solid knowledge of the differences between fission and fusion.  So rather than reinvent the wheel, I want to take a different tack. Let's think about the world a hundred years from now.  The worst of climate change has been averted through a mix of solar, wind and geothermal and with a heavy reliance on nuclear power, especially ultra-modern fail-safe molten salt reactors.  But fusion is here, it is spreading rapidly because fusion plants can be built much larger than anything else and with a lower cost per kilowatt-hour as it gets bigger (the engineering suggests this now, not making it up). A great debate arises about what to do with all of the aging green technologies that got us here.  Should we retire the solar plants, wind farms, geothermal steam plants, and especially the aging nuclear fleet? Fusion has incredible promise as a source of energy, but it has one debilitating flaw in my mind.  It requires enormous amounts of energy just to get a fusion reaction up and running, and then almost as much to keep it sustained.  Now, once the fusion reactor is up and running it will just recycle some of its own energy back to the reactor to maintain the unit online, but what about the startup? In the old days power plants often had what are known as blackstart diesel generators.  These were literally giant diesel engines connected to generators that produced the electricity to run the pumps and compressors that any power plant needs to start up and start making their own power.  Once up and running, they just recycle some of the electrical output of their generators back through an auxiliary transformer, and all of the \"house loads\" are supplied while the unit is online. Nowadays most plants have what's known as a startup transformer which takes power from the grid and supplies it to those same pumps and compressors.  Occasionally during huge blackouts a plant can't get back online because they simply don't have the power available to do it.  So they have to sit and wait for power to come to them so they can start up. Now imagine a grid powered entirely by fusion reactors.  Maybe we're far enough in the future that AI computers anticipate every problem and keep grid level outages from happening.  But do you want to rely on that? A failure of the electrical grid on a huge scale would, for all intents and purposes, transform us back into a late 19th century society.  Actually, even worse than that, since many of the factories that existed back then burned coal to make steam and drove their factory equipment with belts and drive shafts powered by that steam engine.  That option simply doesn't exist today. A hundred years in the future transportation will be built on the back of electricity, either battery powered (grid charged) or hydrogen fuel cells (grid produced fuel), but either way it will be electricity powering those vehicles in reality. So the question is, how do you start up a fusion reactor on a fusion only grid without other fusion reactors running?  Answer is, you don't. This is why I think fission will always have a role to play.  It is possible to build a reactor that goes critical on human power.  You read that right, human power.  Humans took the first reactor critical, or at least could have, simply by cranking on a pulley to draw up the control rods.  There is no reason that this couldn't always be true. A nuclear reactor is in my mind like a fission battery.  It's just sitting and waiting to having it's stored energy released.  How do you release it?  By removing whatever is suppressing the nuclear fission reaction (by absorbing neutrons) from the core.  Most reactor cores aren't that big, and they can be as small as a trash can and still produce a fairly large amount of power. So, imagine that same world a hundred years from now, with that same fusion reactor based energy system, except now there are scattered throughout the country (and the world) several old-fashioned molten salt reactors which can be started up with a small diesel generator.  Those MSR's then supply power to a nearby fusion reactor, which uses that power to start up and start supplying the bulk loads on the grid. In my mind it's this always-on capability of fission cores that make it ideal for being a least a part of any future electricity base.  And it's this capability which makes nuclear reactors more reliable and sustainable in at least one sense than fusion reactors. ",

            "answer_text": "Michael Flagg has it right.  Fusion is not anywhere near as reliable and sustainable a source of energy as fission from an engineering perspective.  But I'd like to add the perspective of fuel source as well.  Some people fret about the availability of fissile material for fission energy production.  For a while in the 1950's and 60's the supply of Uranium was thought to be quite limited.  But since then, we've discovered quite a lot of heavy metal on Earth and we've developed the technology to utilize fertile isotopes of Uranium and Thorium.  The quantity of Uranium dissolved in the world's oceans is vast.  Furthermore, Uranium is slightly water soluble, so the process of tectonics and erosion are constantly increasing the quantity of Uranium dissolved in the oceans.  Recently seawater uranium extraction technology has been demonstrated showing the ability to achieve costs around $250/kgU.  At these costs, the impact on electricity prices would be under 1\u00a2/kW-hr.  And, if we did this at huge scale, the costs would likely decline into further insignificance. Even if humanity were to extract Uranium from seawater for energy production quickly enough to provide all of humanity's energy needs, the concentration of Uranium in the seas would continue to increase for many many millions of years.  The world's rivers are washing Uranium into the oceans faster than we can use it.  In fact, the Earth's supply of fertile material would outlast the sun's supply of hydrogen if used at current global human energy consumption.  We have billions of years of Uranium available to us and roughly 4 times as much Thorium that we can burn through while we wait for controlled fusion technology to catch up.  Nuclear fission is truly sustainable compared to so-called renewable technologies that rely on the sun to keep shining. ",
