            "answer_text": "Yes it does, but only in a way that does not actually transmit any tangible information or energy faster than the speed of light. You can think of it this way: a particle can exist in multiple places at one time, but only so long as it does not interact with anything else in the Universe. As soon as it interacts with something else, it does so in exactly one of its possible locations. Upon that event, it suddenly does not exist in any of the other places it might have existed. In the language of physics, its wave function has \u201ccollapsed\u201d to a single physical state. This cessation of its other potential existences is indeed a non-local phenomenon, but that non-locality transmits neither substance nor energy nor information. Because every interaction of a particle with anything else collapses its wave function, it can either be detected here or there but never both. It is possible that here and there are separated by a vast distance, but the first detection of the particle forestalls its detection in any other place. And that in turn forestalls any faster-than-light communication. For example, let us imagine a photon being emitted at point A, with nothing to block its travel in any direction. This photon is essentially traveling in all possible directions, as a spherically expanding wave front. . . . . . . . . .( A ) . . . . . . . ((( A ))) . . . . ((( . . . A . . . ))) [ Ignore the periods, I just put them in to preserve typographical spacing. ] Now let us assume that points B and C are each one light-year away from A, in opposite directions. B ((( . . . . . A . . . . . ))) C After one year, the photon passes points B and C at the same time. The important thing to note is that one single photon, one single particle, is passing both B and C at the same time even though they lie in opposite directions from the point where it was emitted. If there are detectors at each point, the photon has some probability of being detected at either point. Suppose it is detected at point B. When that happens, the chance of it being detected at C immediately drops to zero. According to our best understanding of the Universe, that same photon had an equal probability of being detected at C instead. And if that had happened, its probability of being detected at B would immediately drop to zero. This is a non-local effect. Detection in one place immediately forecloses detection in the other place, even though they are two light-years distant. There is no propagation delay. But that non-locality cannot be used to communicate between B and C. If the photon is detected at one of those two points, it will never be detected at the other one. No tangible information is communicated between B to C, and no substance or energy is transmitted between B and C. The thing that is transmitted non-locally at a speed greater than light is a transition from \u201cthe photon hasn\u2019t been detected here but might be\u201d to \u201cthe photon will never be detected here\u201d. And that particular kind of transition cannot possibly communicate any information. The only possible conveyance of information and energy is between A, where the photon was emitted, and either B or C, where it was possibly detected. Since B and C are each one light-year away from A, and photons always travel at the speed of light when traveling through the vacuum of space, that transmission will always take exactly one year as expected.

            "answer_text": "Common misconception. So common that I made a 2-minute video about it, while in lockdown.  QM talks about superposition. But it\u2019s not a superposition of where an electron actually is located (or what spin it actually has). Superposition is always with respect to some type of measurement. For example spin: A spin-up electron is in a superposition with respect to a detector that detects spin-right or spin-left. But the same electron is not in a superposition with respect to a detector that detects spin-up or spin-down. So we do have superposition, but of possible measurement outcomes, not of current values. When an electron interacts with a detector, the detector makes it change it state and reports on the new state. It does not report on the pre-detection state. I think one reason for the confusion is that people think the wave function, [math]\\Psi[/math], is the electron, and that it lives in ordinary space. However, [math]\\Psi[/math] only describes the state of the electron. And [math]\\Psi[/math] lives in Hilbert space. ",
