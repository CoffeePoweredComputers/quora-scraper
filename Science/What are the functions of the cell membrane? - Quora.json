            "answer_text": "This is a very short question which has an indefinitely long answer! I don\u2019t know what level of your biology you\u2019re studying but I\u2019m going to assume you are in the process of, or have previously studied high school biology. The answer is obviously going to be very technical so it\u2019s to your advantage to do your own reading and Google to clarify whatever you don\u2019t understand. Feel free to leave any questions in the comments below too. Also, please don\u2019t copy my answer wholesale for your Biology essay; it\u2019s very uncool and it isn\u2019t going to make you any smarter. Here are some bullet points that give a broad overview of the functions of a cell membrane in a generalized eukaryotic cell: First, you have to understand the structure of the cell membrane. Study the diagram below:  \u200b The cell membrane is phospholipid bilayer. Each phospholipid molecule is amphipathic in nature, i.e. it has a hydrophilic (\u201cwater-loving\u201d) phosphate head and a hydrophobic (\u201cwater-hating\u201d) hydrocarbon tail. The hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails form the core of the membrane which excludes water and prevents it from entering or leaving the cell. The hydrophilic phosphate heads interact with the aqueous medium both inside and outside the cell and stabilize the membrane. Interspersed between the phospholipids are molecules of cholesterol and a variety of proteins whose functions we will get to later. For the cell surface membrane in particular, there are other molecules too, like glycoproteins (protein+carbohydrate) and glycolipids (phospholipid+carbohydrate). Due to this structure of the cell membrane, it serves to: 1.\tSeparate the cell contents from the external environment. This membrane is specifically referred to as the cell surface membrane. 2.\tAllow the formation of organelles within the cell. For example, vesicles and lysosomes are single membrane organelles while mitochondria and chloroplast are double membrane organelles. The advantage of the membrane is that it allows the development of specialized biochemical pathways within the organelle. The higher concentration of enzymes and substrates within the organelle speeds up chemical reactions. Also, the conditions within the organelle, such as pH, can be adjusted to be favourable to certain chemical reactions. For instance, lysosomes have an acidic pH which is required for the optimum function of certain digestive enzymes. 3.\tRegulate the movement of substances into and out of the cell. For instance, aquaporins on the cell surface membrane allow water to enter the cell by osmosis. Glucose carrier proteins specifically transport glucose into and out of cells. Ion channels control the movement of ions into and out of the cell. Bulk transport such as exocytosis and endocytosis can obviously only occur in the presence of membranes. Lipid soluble substances, such as steroid hormones and small molecules like oxygen can, however, diffuse freely across the cell membrane. Within the cell, the movement of substances across membranes must also be controlled so that certain processes can occur. For example, the inner mitochondrial membrane contains proton pumps that serve to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space. These protons flow back to the matrix via the membrane protein and enzyme ATP synthase via a process known as chemiosmosis. Chemiosmosis releases energy which is used to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. One specific example of a process in which regulation of substances across the membrane is important is in the generation of action potentials in a nerve cell. The process involves voltage gated Na+ and K+ channels. The phospholipid layers of the myelin sheath that wraps around the axons of neurons serve to prevent leakage of ions and loss of electrical transmission. This works because ions are hydrophilic and cannot pass through the myelin. 4.\tAllow cells to communicate with each other. The glycolipids and glycoproteins have carbohydrate chains which allow certain types of cells to recognize each other. 5.\tAllow the cell to respond to signals from the external environment. For instance, receptor tyrosine kinases recognize and bind to insulin. G protein coupled receptors recognize adrenaline (epinephrine). 6.\tCholesterol helps to regulate the fluidity of the cell membrane. At low temperatures, it increases the fluidity of the cell surface membrane by disrupting the close packing of phospholipids. At high temperatures, it draws phospholipid molecules closer together and decreases fluidity. The differing cholesterol content of cell membranes can be used to explain why certain types of vegetables grow well in certain temperatures and not in others. 7.\tCertain enzymes e.g. adenylyl cyclase which converts ATP to cAMP are found on the cell surface membrane. The electron transport chain proteins used in respiration are embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane which is important because it allows the electron transport proteins to be arranged spatially in order of increasing oxidizing power. 8.\tWithin the cell, you have the endomembrane system. Lysosomes are involved in processes like intracellular digestion and even autophagy where the cell digests itself. The Golgi Apparatus allows post-translational modifications of proteins to occur. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum allows for detoxification and lipid synthesis. Vesicles allow for the release and acceptance of substances by exocytosis and endocytosis respectively. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is a site of protein synthesis. It shields new polypeptide chains from the environment to allow them to fold into the correct 3D shape. 9.\tSome integral proteins are attached to the cytoskeleton of the cell. This provides structural support and maintains the shape of the cell. ",

The main functions of cell membrane are- Cell membrane gives definite shape to the cell and provides mechanical support.Cell membrane is selectively permeable in nature and maintains unequal distribution of Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl- ions across the cell membrane, which plays crucial role in generation of potential difference across the plasma membrane. The inside of cell is negative as compared to out side the cell and , potential difference across the plasma membrane is known as resting membrane potential (RMP), when the cell is in resting state. RMP varies from -70 mV to -90 mV.Membrane bound voltage-gated and receptor-operated ionic channels (Na+, K+ & Ca2+- channels), ionic pumps (Na+, K+-ATPase & Ca2+-ATPase) and ion-exchange systems (e.g. Na+-Ca++ antiport) take part in ion-transport across cell membrane, which plays pivotal role in generation of AP & pacemaker potential, muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, excitation-secretion coupling, neurotransmitter release, etc.Cell membrane possesses various plasma membrane bound receptors for the physiological actions of various hormones, neurotransmitters and drugs.Plasma membrane bound G-protein takes part in signal transduction. The cell membrane bound enzymes adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase catalyze the production of cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP which serve as \u2018second messenger\u2019 and take part in signal transduction.Microvilli of intestinal epithelial cells increase the cellular surface area many folds and take part in absorption of digested food like glucose, amino acids, etc.Different muco/glyco-proteins of membranes of RBCs constitute the blood groups.Active transport of proton (H+) by the cell membrane bound H+-pump (K+-H+-ATPase) of gastric patrietal cells is responsible for production of acid (HCl) in stomach.Membrane bound phospholipase C takes part in calcium-phosphatidyl-inositol system.ENDOCYTOSIS (Phagocytosis & Pinocytosis) is an important function of plasma membrane. Phagocytosis (Greek: cell eating) is a mechanism that enables the cells to engulf the solid particles like bacteria. It is shown by cells of immune system- neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages.\r Pinocytosis (Greek: cell drinking) is, however, intake of droplets of liquid.EXOCYTOSIS: Cell membrane takes part in secretion of secretory materials like digestive enzymes, hormones, plasma proteins, immunoglobulins, etc. and excretion of waste products out side the cell.Ref: Textbook of Biochemistry with Biomedical Significance by Prem Prakash Gupta, CBS Publishers New Delhi, second edition  ",

            "answer_text": "The cell membrane could be considered the single most important feature of a living cell (with perhaps the exception of DNA/RNA). It's composed of several types of triacyglyerides and other molecules that form a bilayer separating the cell from the extra cellular space around it. The reason a cell can survive is because it can create the perfect environment (pH and ion concentrations) for the cell machinery to operate to reproduce DNA and the cell itself. The membrane allows the cell to manipulate the ions it brings in and releases, both actively and passively. Without the proper intake of ions and other cofactors, the proteins inside the cell couldn't function. Cells often have machinery that allows them to interact with other cells ( some of which are located on the membrane to come into contact with other cells. These come into as cells can inject small DNA molecules (plasmids) into other cells, potentially giving them some form of resistance or a helpful gene. Simply put, everything in life is compartmentalized in some way. The cell membrane is natures way of doing that. ",

Cellular membranes are complex mixtures of lipids and proteins designed to keep biochemistry inside and other chemistry outside. They also have a key function in providing energy to a cell via the mitochondria were membranes maintain a separate unit within the cell, and in addition provide a structural matrix for the production of energy. Another key membrane is the membrane surrounding our reproductive DNA, defining an area we call the nucleus. Although the majority of our DNA is confined in this space, mitochondria also have small amount of DNA. Apart from structural functions membrane also play an important part in respiration and in the movement of different nutrients into the cell and waste products out of the cell. The kidneys are an example of the importance of membranes in maintaining the homeostasis of the body as a whole being made up of millions of microfiltration units called nephrons, basically convoluted membranes that filter bad stuff out of the body. Infact we are basically little sacs of chemicals held together in a variety of matrix materials that collectively forms a living organism. ",
