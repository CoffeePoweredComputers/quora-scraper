            "answer_text": "Counting them is a little tricky, due to a few subtleties: Do antiparticles count as the same kind of particle? They emerge from the same field.Do left- and right-handed particles count as the same kind of particle? They have different electroweak interactions, come from different SU(2) representations, and give different degrees of freedom.Do up and down quarks count as the same kind of particle? They come from the same SU(2) doublet.Do different quark colors count as different particles? [Do gluons?]And so on. There isn\u2019t really a well-defined \u201cnumber of particles\u201d that meshes well with common language in every case. A reasonable interpretation of these questions in terms of everyday language is no, yes, no, no[/yes] (at least, as our normal language goes). In this case, you have 24 fermions (6 quarks, 6 leptons, and their antiparticles), 12 gauge bosons (photon, W+/W-/Z, 8 gluons), and the Higgs boson, for a total of 33 particles. If you add in the theorized but unobserved graviton, this would make 34. This could be reduced to 30(/31) depending on how you count neutrinos (and what kind of particle they are); neutrinos may be their own antiparticle. [This is what searches for \u201cneutrinoless double beta decay\u201d seek to determine.] ",

            "answer_text": "The Standard Model currently accounts for 6 quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top), 6 antiquarks, 6 leptons (electron, muon and tau, and their respective neutrinos), 6 antileptons, 13 gauge bosons (8 gluons, photon, W+, W-, Z and graviton) and 1 Higgs boson. That adds up to 38 distinct elementary particles. There may be many more in other proposed theories, such as supersymmetric models. ",
