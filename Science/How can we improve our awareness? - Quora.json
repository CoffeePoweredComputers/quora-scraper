            "answer_text": "Use the process I outline here in this response! The headline steps were created by Tony Robbins and I\u2019ve added my own narrative to interpret them for you. But first, some background\u2026 I can be incredibly impatient, I\u2019m too fast paced through life, and sometimes I stress at things that don\u2019t matter. These \u2018bad traits\u2019 take energy away from important tasks and make life less enjoyable. Sometimes I\u2019m ruining things rather than building things. I\u2019m way better than I used to be and that\u2019s awesome, but these flaws are still there. They are my ongoing self awareness improvement projects. I don\u2019t want to be \u2018cured\u2019 completely though, there\u2019s a lot of power in being an emotional being like me. If you take away the impatience completely what will happen to my drive\u2026? Will I think it\u2019s good to be a lazy loser? Will I quit working and live out my days festering on the sofa watching Netflix? The negative can drive the positive. If I lose money I get pissed off and I use my frustration to make even more back. If I have a bad start at golf I have the mental strength to fight back and not cave. You can\u2019t be a winner without having some traits that sometimes show themselves off in a negative way. For me self awareness is recognising my emotions, understanding why I\u2019m feeling / reacting the way I am and then doing something about it. Channelling my emotions into positive action and aligning my actions with my ambitions. I don\u2019t want to wallow in self pity and shame. I don\u2019t want to waste anymore of my life feeling stressed, anxious or angry. I don\u2019t want to waste my opportunity to live a great life. In my last 2 articles I\u2019ve covered why self awareness is so important and how you can use the power of self awareness to create something great: A life that you love, filled with abundance. These articles covered why I pay so much attention to self awareness and why you should too. If you missed them, here they are: The Undeniable Power of Self Awareness How to Use Self Awareness to Start a New Venture Here I\u2019m going to complete my self awareness series by sharing a 6 step process from master coach, Tony Robbins. We\u2019ve covered why you should develop your self awareness and the power it has to change your life. This is how to actually go about it. Here is Tony\u2019s process along with my narrative\u2026 1.Identify what you are really feeling Can you tell the difference between feeling angry and scared? Anger is usually fear clothed. Don\u2019t take every emotion at face value. Look deeper and ask yourself what you are really feeling. 2. Acknowledge and appreciate your emotions, knowing they support you Be thankful that your body is sending you a signal. Usually the signal means that something in your life needs to change. You just need to figure out what. Don\u2019t presume all negative emotions are bad for you \u2013 they provide vital insight which allows you to take responsive action. Use your negative emotions, don\u2019t shield yourself from the perceived danger of them. Work with them to fuel positive change. 3. Get curious about the message this emotion is offering you Ask yourself why you are feeling the way you are. Then ask \u2018how would I like to be feeling about this?\u2019 I get mad at the kids making noise sometimes, but I don\u2019t want to get so easily pissed about it. Why am I so averse to kids playing loudly? Why do I hate a messy house? These are difficult questions I still can\u2019t answer fully\u2026 it\u2019s a work in progress. 4. Get confident Confidence comes from doing something successfully again and again. Once you\u2019ve mastered an emotion or a situation once, remember how you did it the next time it comes around. Know that you can deal with that circumstance positively and make it a regular response. This was an extract from my article \u2014 Self Awareness Superpowers of the Elite for the final 2 steps and a lot more just follow the link! Thank you. Matt ",

            "answer_text": " Since your question does not specify it, I\u2019ll go a different route than everyone else and consider that \u201cawareness\u201d can mean one of two things: (1.) Awareness of objects other than oneself, that is, a directedness towards an object that allows the object to come to the fore in a vivid presence (2.) Awareness of oneself as an object - or self-awareness - that is, a directedness towards our (previous/future) directedness Now, following Locke, these two types of awareness have been understood as stemming from two basic human faculties: perception, and inner perception, or reflection. As all faculties, perception and reflection are abilities, that is to say, capacities to perform actions of a certain type. As such, they can be more or less developed in different people, but the degree to which they are developed in one person can also vary over time. A person might be more perceptive as a child than they are as an adult, but will be more prone to reflection as an adult than they are as a child. So how can we enhance our faculties of perception and reflection? Like with other abilities - say running - by putting them to use more often, and in a way that makes their exercise more and more difficult. In the case of both perception and reflection, this means confronting them with certain pertinent contents which all but\u2026 escape them. In the Lockeian tradition, \u201cperception\u201d is taken in the strict sense and its only such contents are (images of) physical things, such as tables, chairs and the like; but other traditions, like the phenomenological one, often take \u201cperception\u201d in a broader sense that extends its contents to ideal ones, such as \u201ctruth\u201d, \u201cthe number 4\u201d etc. Now - and this is also in line with the phenomenological tradition - perception is most successful in grasping a given object, whatever that may be, when said object is in a striking contrast to all other surrounding objects, i.e., when it stands out as compared to everything else. The best perceived table in a row of black tables is the only white one. Conversely, perception fails to detach an object from the ones in its background, when all of them are too alike. Instead of perceiving various separate black tables aligned in a row, what we perceive is a sort of a uniform, albeit complex \u201crow of black tables\u201d. In this respect, enhancing perception amounts to challenging one\u2019s eye to see differences first in contents that seem similar, then in those that seem indistinguishable or even identical. Reflection, on the other hand, relates to contents that are operations of the mind, such as perception itself, but also willing, feeling and the like. However, this is the reason why unlike perception, reflection cannot grasp its object by simply recognizing its contrasting features, it has to moreover extract it from a an experience that is always given as a whole, say the perception of a table. Contrast only obtains when objects share certain kinds of qualities, like color, shape etc., not when they belong to categories - as with the act of perceiving and the table - which by definition have nothing in common. Enhancing reflection thus requires to force oneself to disassociate, or to abstract one content form a content that is never given separately from the first one. I have found that philosophy has helped me with both. ",
