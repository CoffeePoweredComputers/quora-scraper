            "answer_text": "Technology is very powerful and nothing is as good as technology at improving life. Even though this is both good on paper and on the surface there are drawbacks to this. Technology can affect life both positively and negatively. New technology always changes our life very much and takes it to a new level. It is like the new way of thinking or doing the normal things differently, better and much more faster with less hassle and at a much affordable rate. Imagine life before Electricity, Life before the Automobile, life before the Telephone, life before the Computer, life before the iPhone. Before those technologies life was much less complex but it was at the same time very difficult to get many things done with just the twelve hours of visible light that we are given with each day.  As illustrated in the figure, Technology evolves, as as it evolves there more we find more convenient ways to get many things done in a day without too much hassle and this is one of the great benefits of having new technology. To fully answer your question i shall state an answer with both pros and cons that are backed by evidence of existing facts of how new technology affects our life both positively and negatively. New Technology Improves quality of life for human beings and as a side effect it makes it complex and have a negative effects on the environment.PROS: Without technology life would be very difficult and behind. Technology has brought many great things such as the ability to have light during night by using what we call Electricity. Let us use electricity as an example, Electricity alone has taken life on earth for human beings to another dimension. Imagine how bad your day can be and how your life gets stuck if there is no electricity just for four hours. Electricity is the most versatile energy source on the planet, even though we\u2019ve only depended on it for about 100 years now. Its been only hundred years and look how improved life is as compared to 5 centuries ago. So imagine if we had been depended on it from the very start, Life would have been very very much better... People like Newton, Galelio, Maxwell, Gauss, Kepler and others would have developed far more better tools that make life better for all human beings. Imagine a 1000 years with electricity? Life would really be in a different dimension\u2026 I wish i could live to witness that. Technologies such as computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones make it easy for human beings of today to exchange information, make faster decisions, interact socially, get entertainment, process financial transactions efficiently, buy online, manage homes and other existing technologies. This has made it much more efficient to travel because cheap air tickets can be purchased at a press of a button, an Uber cab can come collect you at your own time no more waiting. There is a cheap way of connecting with friends and family through social media and now you don\u2019t have to remember people\u2019s birthday because social media can always remind you. Technology unlocks life that was unimaginable. Life that only existed in people\u2019s dreams. As Einstein once put it imagination alone is too powerful. Technology is the reflection of people\u2019s imagination on solving existing problems. These problems pushes human beings to transform their imagined ideas to solving these problems into technological innovations which as a result improve life. For more on this see my answer to this question - Have we reached the limit of technology? CONS: However, as much as electricity has brought too much convenience to the lives of human beings on earth it has also complicated it in a way. There is too much dependency on electricity and as a result there is overuse of electricity and since most of electricity is generated through natural gas. Too much use of natural gas has a net effect on the earth\u2019s climate system. This is really bad because it means the next generation of human beings may not find the earth as green as it is today.  Also electricity has led to complexity of many tasks. Today the average human being does not want to do laundry with hands but wants a machine to do that, same goes for warming food with a microwave oven, exercising on a treadmill, using a dishwasher to wash dishes. Walking around the city on foot is no longer easy one has to obey robot signs and etc. These things were made to make life easy for human beings however, if you do not have them or afford them life can be difficult and very complex for you as a human being because things are longer done the manual way. Lastly, new technologies such as the Smartphones, Laptops, Tablets have negative effects on the environment and on the balance of life though they are meant to make life great. If you can\u2019t afford these technologies your life becomes very backward. Technology also give too many options to choose from which can sometimes make life of a person very difficult.  Also most of computer technologies of today have a bad footprint on the environment because they expire after some time creating hazardous electronic waste or e-waste. Also the net energy required to create these technologies and also to transport them across the world also increases and contributes to the total pollution of the earth. In summary: New technology brings new qualities to the lives of human beings but also has a side effect. What i have noticed is that usually human beings tolerate this side effect for as long as it takes until that current new technology becomes irrelevant and again new technology has to be invented. I once read something that once said, Make something that will make people believe they are thinking and they will love you forever, but if you make something that will make people think then they will hate you. So in simple words, New technology can improve life both positively and negatively.

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, some of the ways that technology is changing the way we live is by reducing the TIME we spend to create articles or even letters that we have to hand write or use a typewriter to type up and send via envelope (mail). These options take days for one party to send and for another party to receive. It is much easier and more time effective to send an email or a text message in order to notify a party of your choice For any reason. Instead of going to a library to read through as many books as they have available to find information on a certain matter may take a couple days. It is much easier to grab your smart phone pull up the Internet browser and search your question and find the answer. Simply just like this opinion based article. Once it again, this technology is a TIME saver. The information that we can pour is incredible we could be anything from private information all the way to public information. We can share with the world what we see at a particular moment instantly & we can keep the world around us updated no matter what we do, see or hear. We can receive feedback from our peers within a blink of an eye. We can also shop for everything and anything we want with click of a button. Better vehicles are created each and every year that are safer and generate more miles per gallon which is better for the environment. Also it helps reduce gasoline consumption and oil consumption so that I can last longer. We are also creating electric vehicles that can run on one charge just as a vehicle can that is gas powered. The GPS that the vehicles & smart phones have today are amazing. Farming equipment has also become a lot more up to date in order to help at farmers know when to plant their crops and also help them harvest their crops.The machine are used today is incredible it has GPS is only out of their field and your property lines which they can work late hours gathering everything up without having to exert too much energy. This means more crops faster delivery and more products to reach more people around the world. Technology has given us more time and has provided us with more options on educating oneself much faster and more efficiently than without the piece of technology. Convenience is also a very big product that we are all trying to utilize today, which convenience also turns into time management and time management turns into higher profits if one person is a businessman or an entrepreneur.

            "answer_text": "Well, from my experience on how technology changed my life. Let\u2019s just say it made everything easier. These are some examples I can get food by just clicking some few buttons and never move an inch of my ass (Lazy fuk right here) instead of hunting for food like the ancient old days.You want a girlfriend without needing to be romantic, setting a perfectly planned date and getting her to like you ? Pfftt,who wants to do all that? Now you can just swipe then bam! instant smas\u2026. girlfriend .Because of the internet, I am a changed person. From \u201cAn innocent boy who thinks everything is good and interesting\u201d to \u201cf a k m y l i f e\u201d while wasting my time on memes and fuelling my existential suffering about the meaningless of life. (Thanks technology)In all seriousness, technology helped us exponentially innovate different aspects of society, from the first technological breakthrough which is the industrial revolution to the now modern age of mankind where information is rapidly spreading, food is enormously produced and abundant, and we can travel anywhere in any part of the world in just hours instead of the old times which took them months before they can reach another country, HOW COOL IS TECHNOLOGY?. But it also led to some chaotic discoveries. We harnessed the power of destruction with the atomic bomb which was used in the Second World War, killing thousands of innocent civilians. We are wasting our time on unneeded consumption of unnecessary information on social media sites and other time wasting sites, creating a concerning disconnect between our supposed to achieve goals and our tangible reality. To summarize, technology changed peoples lives for the better and worse. It\u2019s up to us to know the consequences of what we\u2019re creating, and be able to make prudent decisions for the betterment of humanity. ",

            "answer_text": "It is my view that technology has not changed our life per see in terms of quality of life, but it has certainly exposed, reviewed, and enhanced what already existed. What I meaning is that technology has NOT in any way made people who were unhappy to suddenly be happy, or those who had no purpose, no meaning, no fulfillment, no love to suddenly have a purpose, meaning, fulfillment, or love. Of course, I do acknowledge that activities in life have certainly changed, but the most important yardsticks of life, in general, have primarily remained the same. Instead, it has exposed underlying problems that existed before, brought more awareness to things that were in the dark. Casing point, technology has exposed the high level of knowledge and skills inequality in the World. As I write to you now, more than 3.6 billion people in the world today do not have access to the Internet. According to the UN, as of December 2019, close to 87% percent of individuals in developed countries used the Internet, compared with only 19% percent in the least developed countries. This is not to say technology is bad, my point is that technology can be used for good or for bad depending on the people involved and how they use technology. We have witnessed firsthand how digital technologies have helped us to confront the threat of COVID 19 and how technology has kept people connected during lockdowns. In essence, technology is a tool, which in the hands of someone who knows how to use it well, someone with a heart, indeed can use it to enhance work and effort, can be used to touch the lives of people for the better. An individual can truly do more work, impact more people, and do more good. The opposite is true for someone who uses it for bad, we have seen and read of terrible acts of evil enhanced through technology. All in all, technology is not to blame, people are to blame for the abuse, misuse, or any negatives that are associated with technology. Just like a knife is a tool to do some good works that depend on using one, the same is true with technology. ",

            "answer_text": "How has technology effected human life? Well, I\u2019m here to answer this question, for one. :) Not that this is world-shaking to anybody but me, but hey\u2026 Without the medication to treat my chronic bronchitis as a child, I\u2019d either not be here, or be enjoying the experience a lot less. OK, this is all very general, off the top of my head, stuff concerning technology and War, Famine, and Death, and Pestilence, those traditional horsemen of the Apocalypse: PESTILENCE We\u2019ve covered this; me and the rest of the planet either have, or should have, benefited from modern medical technology. It\u2019s spreading; one hopes it will continue to spread. Humans are vulnerable to everything from dirty drinking water, to bacteria in the soil, to parasites in the animals we eat, to knock-on diseases from neglect in childhood, to general wearing out from hard work and old age\u2014which, again, makes them vulnerable to diseases. Fewer people die now than would have a century ago. If people weren\u2019t being people (that is, gullible idiots) we would have eliminated measles, mumps, and polio along with smallpox.DEATH Check out the infant mortality statistics, specifically deaths in the first 12 months, and deaths in the first 5 years. Generally, as soon as you hit a certain tech level, infant mortality drops like a stone, and people stop having huge families in order that a few survive to adulthood. In the UK, in my lower middle class family, both my grandparents came of large families, as was common - 14 and 18 children respectively. A lot died. My grandparents had three children; those children had three, three, and one, respectively. Of my generation\u2026 I\u2019m pretty sure one of us has reproduced, and that\u2019s it.Because - another huge change brought about by technology - women can now choose not to have children. Previous to that, abstaining from heterosex was your only option, and even then you might have the choice taken away from you. Most women currently alive can use contraception, if they can get it. And where they do, birth rates drop, and wealth levels rise. Oh yes \u2014 and far, far fewer women die in child-birth.FAMINE The internet. I put it under this heading for two reasons. First, that you can use technology both to gather knowledge about the conditions for famine, and to predict it in specific instances. Then you can use tech again to alleviate it.We need to be careful about this, because technology has also left us uniquely vulnerable to disease now. With plane travel as it is, yersina pestis (or whatever the Black Death actually was) could be around the globe in 24 hours. One disease jumping the from birds to humans in China, and oops. One third of the human race dying, instead of one third the population of Europe in 1348, might put us in such chaos that technology can\u2019t rescue us. Technological societies are fragile.WAR The internet is becoming a huge technological advance, though I think it\u2019s not quite there yet. Wait until the sum total of human knowledge prior to the 21st century is available at your fingertips, as well as what\u2019s going on now; wait until the whole planet has whatever device follows the smartphone.It\u2019s possible that the most important piece of technology to be invented after the personal computer is the drone? Why? Because it\u2019s cheap (comparatively so), reasonably available, and civilians can use it as well as the military.As was pointed out in another post, it can be used to involve lay people in science projects \u2014 that one was directing paleontologists in a live dig in Kenya \u2014 and the more you can bring people in to contribute like that, the more technological a society you\u2019ll get.A drone can show the truth about wars that governments would prefer you not see \u2014 rather like the smartphone calls home from Syria, but more so. With a sufficiently sophisticated and powered drone, you could play GoogleEarth with the real Earth.And\u2026then we have warfare that\u2019s as simple, and as visible, as tabletop lead figures in a wargame. Complete transparency is not something that has ever occurred in warfare to date. Drones can potentially act as spotters for snipers, carry and precision-drop micro-bombs, perform surgical assassinations, insert tailored viruses into water supplies, and just plain obliterate the \u201cfog of war\u201d. And, yes, \u201cthe enemy\u201d (perhaps us, if we are the enemy) will find ways to block vision, but the slaughters before that\u2026<shudder> ",

            "answer_text": "Well the simplest way to answer is that has both positive and negative influences on our life. The positive ones are for example the Internet. Never before in the history of mankind has it been able to establish a connection so fast and clear between two houses, let alone the whole world. Without such technology you wouldn\u2019t have been able to even ask this question now and I wouldn\u2019t be able to write down this answer. Other big influence on us is the rise of smartphones, because again we can keep communicating through these small handheld devices with no problems a thousand miles away. And I won\u2019t even start to talk about the rise in so called smart cars which are still in prototype stage, but are shaping up to be a big game changer too. On the other side though we have the negative influences of the Internet, which are caused by it\u2019s biggest advantage - ease of information. I don\u2019t think you have ever tried this but only if you google \u201chow to make a bomb\u201d on the normal google search engine, not in the darknet, you will get around 5 pages telling you how to do it. This information can be accessed by any person and creates a big danger for the society, because that any person could be a potential terrorist. The question here to be asked is not how to make that bomb but why is there such a thing. But I think that the biggest problem we have nowadays is with the addiction to this technology. It has slowly become this big part of our lives, which we can\u2019t imagine living without. There is an old saying that goes \u201c The more crutches you have, the more it hurts when they\u2019re kicked out from under you\u201d. We have become over dependent on technology and if one day all this technology suddenly stops working whether that be to a World War III or something else, the world would probably go crazy. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s affecting humanity in ways I couldn\u2019t fathom myself. Humanity have came a long way from living in caves, afraid of the dark and not knowing what the hell is happening around them. It might not be an easy thing to realize, but when you look around our lives now, I personally can\u2019t even know where to begin explaining it. Technology is a very, very, broad term. As I understand it, technology is not all about \u201ctech-related\u201d or science or engineering alone. They are the whole workings of Homo sapiens style of doing things and solving problems, started by tool-making ancestors[1] back when we were still running naked and hunting for food.  Image 1: A diorama at the Nairobi National Museum portrays early hominids processing game with tools. It is often argued that human technology started when early humans saw the value in using various objects they could find around them to help them survive the harsh living condition. Source. It has grown so much from where we departed, that the technology we have today is magic even by standard of people in, say, 19th century. Could you imagine what would it be like if we show today\u2019s technology to people from earlier history? Some would probably lose their mind! From the most mundane stuff like the clothes we wear, the shoes we love, vehicles, cars, houses, fences, locks, doors, to pinnacle of technology like aeroplanes, rockets, TVs, dishwashers, plumbing systems and silliest things like toilet bowls are all results of our ability to solve problems through technology.  Image 2: Russian Sukhoi SU-27 Flanker, one of the fastest fighter jet in the world capable of reaching speed of 2.35 mach (roughly 2,901.78 km/h). This is arguably one of the best example of marvelous technology. Source. Of course, as great as it might sound, human technology is far from perfect. That is why when we try to solve 1 problem another 3 or 4 might come out, and it\u2019s perfectly reasonable, because we humans learn from trial and error, for most - if not all - of our entire journey on this planet. Ethical problems are hot topics in technology, because the way we are able to exploit the workings of the universe so much today, inevitably posed a lot of fundamental questions about ethics, value of human lives, and sometimes, our own existence. In summary, human technology was the only reason we could survive on this planet in the first place. Homo sapiens is a physically weak mammalian species; we don\u2019t have claws, furs, speed, big size, tusks or anything to protect ourselves from even slightly smaller but stronger predators with more developed murdering \u201ctools\u201d at their disposals. But it was long time ago\u2014now we practically are the rulers of this planet, to the point that we are able to destroy* it shall we are eager to do so. (*) Note: After putting some thoughts to it, I guess I should say by using the word \u201cdestroy\u201d, I don\u2019t exactly mean completely obliterating the entire planet to the point of utter destruction. It is more like destroying the habitats and environment we\u2019re living in. But who knows, really, as science keeps on marching on[2][3][4].

            "answer_text": "Technology has proved to be a whirlwind because of the massive revolution it has been able to bring into our lives. It has become an integral part of our lives to such an extent that it becomes difficult to picturise our lives minus technology. We are living a less tedious and more hassle-free life now, all thanks to technology.  You name it and technology has the solution ready for you. Something as complex as networking too has been made much seamless by technology. Here goes the story of a woman who was able to leverage her skills with the aid of technology. In a village named S.H.I.E.L.D. lived a woman by the name of Ms. Pepper Potts. She used to live alone in her house named 'Stark Mansion'. Everyone in the village loved her for her amiable nature. But what people loved about her the most were the different varieties of pickles she used to prepare. She had a thing for pickles ever since she was a kid. Little did she know that she would go on to be known as the 'Pickle lady' of the village. Once her daughter, Morgan Stark, who worked in a city came to visit her. The mother-daughter duo was extremely delighted to have each other's company. They spent the whole night talking. Morgan was telling Ms. Potts how her pickles are loved by her friends back in the city. Just when Morgan was telling about this, an idea crossed her mind. She asked her mom why does she not contact any business dealer and expands her business of pickles. To this Ms. Potts just smiled and said nothing. After being asked by Morgan repeatedly, Ms. Potts said that she is satisfied with the job of selling pickles to the villagers and she doesn't wish for more. She added that contacting dealers won't be a cakewalk. She also asked how will it be possible to find a dealer without having any networking with them. Ms. Potts was a bit old-school and didn't know much about technology. Morgan then asked her mom to relax and said that with technology, almost everything is possible in today's world. She searched for some dealers online and contacted them. One of them used to deal in spices, vegetables, and pickles. Morgan fixed a meeting with him. He asked her to bring some samples of Ms. Potts' pickles to which she readily agreed. On her way back to the city, Morgan took her mom along to meet the dealer. The dealer just went crazy on tasting the pickles and instantly signed the deal with Ms. Potts.  Ms. Potts was flabbergasted with the fact that everything happened quite rapidly and effortlessly too. It was then that she realized the importance of technology and its impact on our lives. This was just a little and sweet example of technology and its advantages. Metvy aspires to help people in a similar manner by giving them the opportunity to expand their network. It is an intuitive app where you can meet and connect with people of the same interests and skillset in the same vicinity. It promotes face-to-face communication among people so as to give their confidence a boost.  #MetAtMetvy ",

            "answer_text": "I reckon technology has significantly changed our lives in many different ways. First of all, thanks to technology, it\u2019s like distances between different places of the world have considerably shortened: technology allows us to keep in touch with people and buy products from literally the other side of the world from us. In addition, it has brought great change upon education (though I think it still has to bring even greater changes to it): thanks to technology it\u2019s easier to find new, additional - and possibly more fun and interactive - materials for students, which is something that enhances the whole learning process, in my opinion. Last but not least, it\u2019s needless to say it has also changed the way we spend our free time, which is not always considered a positive aspect, though. Before technology as we know it today broke out, children were more likely to play outside with other kids. Now, they\u2019re more likely to play with their parents\u2019 (if not their own) tablets/smartphones or other gaming devices. However, I have to say the way adults spend their free time has been affected by technology just as much, so it\u2019s not just one generation\u2019s issue. Not to mention the improvement of technology has also enhanced how information is shared and how fast it spreads nowadays (which is both good and bad, as many fake news can now spread more easily and more quickly than they could when technology wasn\u2019t even a thing). At the end of the day, I believe technology has changed our lives for the better, as its \u2018cons\u2019 seem fewer than its \u2018pros\u2019 to me. However, one should never underestimate its potential and remember to use technology carefully and responsibly. ",

            "answer_text": "With none of us being aware of the unseen forces deftly striking us, our craze over smart gadgets seems to be never-ending. Soon after their arrival in the market, we are blindfolded by the aptness of these devices, ignoring their power-packed negative impact on human health, mostly in the form of non-ionizing radiation.  Appreciation for this much necessary scientific evolution increases as it vows to make our life easier. A simple touch or a stylish swipe is all one needs to connect anyone at any time or to watch what they want to or cook savoury dish within minutes. \u2018One-of-a-kind\u2019 by nature - the radiation, disguised as smart-techs, secretly harms the vital organs in our body with a passage of time. The common perception says Cancer is the only ailment that devours us as a result of long-term exposure to ionizing or non-ionizing radiation emitting from our daily gadgets. But there are other threats like fatigue, headaches, sleep disruptions, altered memory function, poor concentration and spatial awareness which we generally ignore as an issue of any other day.  Some of our favourite Gadgets include: 1) Cell phone 2) Laptop 3) Television Set 4) Wi-Fi Router 5) Microwave Oven These Symptoms Call for our Attention !! \u00b7 Insomnia: Sleepless nights and drowsy mornings? Blame your gadgets and your lifestyle. Phone, Laptop and Bluetooth devices can potentially disturb sleep cycle, especially when we keep scrolling and working in laptops and cell phones. The blue light emitting from these interferes with the red light, leading to disturbed REM sleep.  \u00b7 Disruptive brain function: Your gadgets can hamper day-to-day cognitive abilities due to over-reliance on gadgets like cell phones. Both children and adults alike face problems with social and problem-solving skills which they normally ignore.  \u00b7 Anxiety & Depression: Overusing hand-held devices like cell phones, laptops and other gadgets can make people vulnerable to \u2018stressors\u2019, as they tend to develop escapist behaviour instead of \u2018let\u2019s face it\u2019 approach. These can consequently lead to anxious or depressive moods.  \u00b7 Decreasing sperm count & loss of libido: Cell phones emit electromagnetic radiation which leads to 85% increase in free radicals in our body leading to degradation of sperm count and lowering of testosterone level, responsible for libido in both men and women.  \u00b7 Painful eyes: The blue light from cell phone, laptop and television set can cause macular degeneration in humans. The emitting blue light has short wave length and high energy.  \u00b7 Tender thumbs or numbness in ring & little fingers: This can be an indication of Cubital Tunnel Syndrome where the ulnar nerves get stretched due to elbow flexion resulting in various difficulties in forearm.  \u00b7 Circulatory changes: The non-ionizing radiation from microwave can affect the blood level and heart rate. A research conducted by Swiss clinical study indicated that the subjects who ingested foods prepared in microwave showed increase in WBC along with cholesterol level and decrease in RBC. Staying healthy is just a choice ahead Few lifestyle changes can help you to avoid diseases and let you stay fit and healthy. \u00b7 Keep aside all electronic devices including your cell phone a few hours before bedtime \u00b7 Use anti-glare screen on your monitor or wear glasses having anti-reflective coating while working with your laptops \u00b7 Avoid keeping your laptops on your laps. Instead use a bed table to work, if you are working from home \u00b7 Try to use microwave oven less frequently for the purpose of cooking & heating your food \u00b7 Keep Wi-Fi devices a safe distance away from your place of working or at home \u00b7 Maintain a healthy diet full of anti-oxidants, which can fight off free radicals in your body While staying aloof from modern advancement is foolery, welcoming discipline is the only way to uncloak the disguise and enjoy the purpose of technology. So, let\u2019s be wise and use these smart gadgets in a smart way. ",

            "answer_text": " Oh, in so many magnificent ways. I am probably one of the biggest proponents for technology. I simply am so amazed and fascinated about it, that I just can't help but imagine how wonderful it would be if I am able to one day change the world for the better. Truth be told, I am very aware of how huge the technology industry is yet to be. And I should be crazy not to say that there really is one scary side of future technology. However, today I would like not to put an accent on that. Technology has indeed impacted our lives. In some aspects, it changed our lives for the better and in some aspects it completely ruined humanity. Advantages of technology: I will start off with the good sides because simply I am owed by that. 1. Medicine - Medicine has truly improved since technology has improved tremendously. Various and numerous diseases can be cured due to technology advances. Today, we have many more health care technologies than what we had in the past. Technology positively impacted our health and the overall healthcare system. 2. Learning - I guess this one depends on how you perceive things. I like to think how many new things technology allowed us to gain knowledge in. Thanks to numerous sources we can find online, we are able to educate ourselves on any subject we would like. Also, there are different programs, online schools, and courses that we can take and pay for, in order to learn new skills and information. Disadvantages of technology: Following the two advantages, here are the two biggest disadvantages of the technology. 1. Communication - Unfortunately, due to technology it seems like people forgot how to appropriately communicate with each other. Even though this one also has a good side - such as allowing us to keep in touch with friends and family that do not leave near us, the technology still impacted the way we talk to each other drastically for the worse. More and more young people do not know the basics of healthy communication because they spend more hours typing than actually talking to each other. 2. Productivity - Technology, especially social media impacts our productivity beyond recognition. Today, one of our biggest struggles is to give up our addiction to social media. And it really seems like an impossible thing to do. Nowadays it is very easy to get distracted therefore not be productive or motivated since we have all these kinds of distractions around us. ",
