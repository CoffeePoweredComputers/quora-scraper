            "answer_text": "Better than nothing, I would say. My issue with it is the lack of specificity. The principle of specificity dictates that adaptations to training will be specific to the demands the training puts on the body. Since the purpose of programming is to create the appropriate training stimulus to elicit specific adaptations, you should determine the desired training goals. The training goals ultimately determine the types of exercises and methodologies that need to be part of the workout program. I mean what this workout is for? You\u2019ve got weight lifting as well as calisthenics. Then you have some MMA training thrown in there too. What the shit? Oh, don\u2019t forget mixed martial arts training and parkour. Then you have back squats and leg press one after the other. That\u2019s the same movement pattern - lower body pressing. Unnecessary.  So yea, if you have no idea what you want to get out of your training, go for it. But if you have a specific goal in mind (the principle of specificity), you might want to look for something different.

            "answer_text": "Its really, really stupid imo. So much generic stuff thrown together, inneficient order, too much volume for most people, random rep ranges. Also, I can perform 4 or 5 sets of 20 bodyweight dips but how many average people can do that at the (end) of their workout? ",
