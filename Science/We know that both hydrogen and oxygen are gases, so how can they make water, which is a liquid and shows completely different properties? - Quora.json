            "answer_text": "It is no different than carbon reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. In natural state, carbon exists as a black powder while oxygen is an odorless gas. However, when they react, they form a colorless, odorless gas, which somehow puts out flames. When two chemicals combine, the product takes to the form and properties in which it is most stable. When two chemicals combine, all molecules taking part in the reaction will attempt to reach the octate state i.e. the outer most electron shell of the atom will be full. We must understand that the product of a reaction does not always exhibit the same character as those of the constituents of the product. At room temperature, hydrogen and oxygen exist as colorless gases but water, at the same conditions, exists in liquid state. When a new compound is formed, the intermolecular structure and arrangement of atoms in the compound changes, which is why the new compound exhibits different properties than the reacted components. Another example is of common household soap that we use. Soap is made from fatty acids and strong alkali reaction. The soap does not exhibit any characteristics of it\u2019s constituent compounds, otherwise you would not be able to handle that soap. Strong alkalis like sodium or potassium hydroxide are highly corrosive and toxic in nature. Without ample protection, it is never advised to deal with these solutions and yet soap, made from such a strong alkali, can be easily handled. Weird, isn\u2019t it. Hope this answers your questions.
