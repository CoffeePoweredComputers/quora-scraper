            "answer_text": "Let me check\u2026 Well, the flame on a lit candle smells sort of like burnt nose hair. Ok, I\u2019ll quit joking around. Fire has a huge range of smells depending on the size of it, how long it has been burning, and its fuel source. I remember when I was a child, my parents burned our trash in a \u201cburn barrel.\u201d I kind of enjoyed the smell of paper burning. It had a sweet undertone and reminded me a little of marshmallows. When Dad burned the leaves, it had a completely different smell. I don\u2019t remember what kind of trees they came from, but they smelled a little like syrup or brown sugar as they burned. At a campfire, the logs burning had a deeper, rich, mellow smell. Very inviting. On the grill, the wood chips smelled kind of like bar-b-cue or smoked meats. All of the fire fuels I\u2019ve mentioned above come from trees, yet, they all smell different from one another. A structure fire (like a building) can have a very acrid smell. Not very pleasant to me. Something that smells worse to me, is burning hair. That smell is very pungent, and we all knew when our neighbor (who cut hair for a living) ran her incinerator. It stunk up the neighborhood so intensely, you could almost taste it. Fire itself might not have a smell. I can\u2019t really smell anything when a gas stove is lit. Unless, of course, something besides the fuel gas ends up in the flames. I hope that helps you some. ",

            "answer_text": "Fire itself doesn't smell. It's what's burning that smells. As an object burns it off gases. Once you've been a firefighter for a bit you will start to recognize what's burning by the smell. Sometimes you'll smell something odd in your home or business & call the FD. When we arrive a lot of the times we\u2019ll say oh that's wiring, or a light ballast or insulation or wood or clothes or a belt from an appliance. As you can see most things have a distinct smell that you learn over time. Sorry I can't really describe the smell. ",
