            "answer_text": "Q: What's the point of virtual reality? It\u2019s an interesting question. Not \u201cWhat is Virtual Reality\u201d or \u201cWhat is the purpose of Virtual Reality\u201d but \u201cwhat is the point?? I mean, you could say \u201cwhat\u2019s the point of a steam engine (train)?\u201d You can discuss in detail what they are and what their purpose is, but compared to modern locomotives, there isn\u2019t much of a point. So this is provocative, but a good thought experiment. Let\u2019s turn it around and think about another way to experience different realities - books. What\u2019s the point of a book? I mean, it\u2019s not real. People that read books pay more attention to people that don\u2019t exist, and aren\u2019t aware of what is going on around them. I think we should all just put our books down and look at one another. That\u2019s what my mom says, except she\u2019s talking about the Internet and cell phones. So - here\u2019s my take on the point of VR. You can do things you can\u2019t in real life. VR doesn\u2019t have to \u201clook\u201d real - but when you are in it, it seems real. That\u2019s the point. That simple sense of reality can do marvelous things. It can put you in places that are dangerous or impossible.  People die on Everest. Sure, a VR expedition is nothing like the real thing - but it seems real. Just watching a movie won\u2019t give you that visceral thrill. It won\u2019t make you say \u201cWow! That\u2019s steep!\u201d EVEREST VR \u2014 S\u00f3lfar Studios Can a book help you with a fear of heights?  Richie's Plank Experience on Steam \u201cWalk a mile in my shoes\u201d. It can help with racism. Numerous experiments can put you in the body of someone of another ethnic or racial group. This has been shown to help with empathy.  Empathy/Diversity Learning Empathy Through Virtual Reality: Multiple Strategies for Training Empathy-Related Abilities Using Body Ownership Illusions in Embodied Virtual Reality It can allow you to practice things that you normally couldn\u2019t practice:  Chop and Drop VR on Steam I think that\u2019s the point of VR. And of course, games are a lot of fun. There\u2019s a point to fun!  ",

            "answer_text": "One huge point is that for architecture visualization the VR display gives the right sense of scale. When viewing a 3D model of a planned building for example. When looking at a picture on a conventional display (e.g. laptop display) we don't see it with realistic perspective, are just looking at a picture that is a part of the overall view. Especially for interior spaces it is really difficult to understand the size of the space, typically it seems smaller than it actually is. With VR goggles it feels as if you were in the space and we seem to easily see the scale correctly. The stereoscopic depth view of course helps there too. This way these cheap goggles are a big deal for evaluating building plans I think. ",
