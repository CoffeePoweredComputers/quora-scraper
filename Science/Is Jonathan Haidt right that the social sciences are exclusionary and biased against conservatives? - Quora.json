            "answer_text": "Jonathan Haidt is largely stating what is obvious and common sense. However, Thomas Sowell makes an important additional point that I present below. tl;dr version: Those who believe in economic freedom or hold Nassim Taleb's view of generally placing practice over theory, valuing being a doer more than being a talker etc. are more likely to actually create wealth in the marketplace. Obviously people holding the opposite view are more likely to be drawn to academia, politics etc. So in many ways, you have many A players of the left in academia and politics, but relatively few A players of the right in these fields (since they overwhelmingly choose to hit the industry and contribute there).  Sowell's essay from 1986: Left versus Right  One of the basic problems of conservatives was illustrated by an industrialist in his 70s who was bitterly complaining about a liberal Senator from his state-a Senator who seemed almost certain to be re-elected. \u201cIf I were twenty years younger,\u201d the conservative industrialist said, \u201cI\u2019d run against him myself!\u201d Maybe. But there was a time when he was 20 years younger-and he didn\u2019t run against any liberals then.  When bright, educated young people are choosing careers, those who believe who believe in a free market economy often choose careers in that economy. Those opposed to such an economy are more likely to become intellectuals, politicians, lawyers, or parts of various liberal or radical movements. For the intellectual and political battles, the deck stacked, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The political left sends it\u2019s A team into battle against the B team of its critics, who have their A team in the marketplace. The historic drift to the left in the Western world over the generations reflects in good part this imbalance in the world of ideas, rather than any success of left-wing politics when actually put into practice. Such policies have a record of economic disaster around the world, especially in Communist countries, but they are roaring success politically in maintaining support of academic and media intellectuals. All that has prevented the total and conclusive victory of political left are the defections from its own ranks- people who have been following the facts and have become fed up with what they have seen. Most of the leading figures who oppose the liberals and leftists in the United States are former liberals and leftists. Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman were both liberals at one time. As a member of the liberal-left Americans for Democratic Action, Ronald Reagan called Barry Goldwater a \u201cfascist.\u201d Friedman had a hand in drafting some of the New Deal legislation he now bitterly attacks. Irving Kristol, the godfather of neo-conservatism, was once a Marxist. Such other leading neo-conservatives as Nathan Glazer and Norman Podhoretz were once prominent supporters of liberal causes. Among blacks today regarded as \u201cconservative,\u201d virtually all were once either liberal or leftists. Harvard professor Glenn Loury, who has criticized preferential treatment programs in recent years, was defending such programs earlier this decade. Walter Williams was such a vocal radical, while serving as a young draftee in the U.S. Army, that he was court-martialed.  This pattern of young liberals and radicals turning against these doctrines as they mature is not confined to the United States or to our own era. It may simply reflect the fact that the case for the political left looks more plausible on the surface but is harder to keep believing in as you become more experienced. So many middle-aged conservatives are former young liberals and radicals that many of them find it hard to understand young conservatives, libertarians, and other youthful opponents of the left. Their suspicion may be based on the old clich\u00e9: \u201cIf you\u2019re not a radical in your twenties, you have no heart - and if you are still a radical in your forties, you have no head.\u201d  But some of the young libertarians and conservatives I have seen don\u2019t strike me as heartless at all. Many are deeply concerned about the tragic social consequences of high-sounding liberal-left programs. Some of the highest quality of thinking and writing among college students today is found in campus newspapers like the Harvard Salient, the California Review, and other student newspapers that stand up to the dominate leftism among the \u201cofficial\u201d student newspapers and among faculty. These youngsters have no choice but to think, because they cannot get by with simply chanting slogans about \u201csocial justice,\u201d \u201cdivestment,\u201d and \u201cworld peace,\u201d as the political left does. The left does not have to think on campus, just chant and demonstrate and feel morally superior. They can win by intimidation on campus, given the favoritism of the faculty and the pliability of the administration. As a result, they are now becoming intellectually the B team.  -Thomas Sowell, 1986 Source:Does maturity lead to the Right path? [Archive] ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of the social sciences (gender studies, LGBT studies) are essentially set up for the purpose of advocating social liberalism, so those areas are basically a lost cause in terms of getting a conservative viewpoint.  But even outside of those faculties, I worked on a university campus for over a decade, and the sheer hatred that was expressed towards conservatives was occasionally frightening. As always, most people just want to do their jobs and go home, but those who did feel like life was a crusade against the right are the loudest. There were groups of friends that I just stopped hanging out with if I could avoid it, because being with them was like Thanksgiving with your opinionated idiot drunk uncle, except you had to live through it EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR.  That's the climate created for conservatives on campuses, and it's going to stay that way for a while, because the people who help create that hostility are usually proud for doing so. Most of the people I worked with were open-minded only to those to the left of them, with libertarians being cautiously tolerated. It's going to get worse on campus before it gets better. ",
