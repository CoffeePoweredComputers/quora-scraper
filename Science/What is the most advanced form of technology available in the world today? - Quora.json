            "answer_text": "The question whats the most advanced technolgy we have is really broad and technolgy comes in many forms. Im gonna put forward my belief that the most advanced \u201cUSE\u201d of technolgy is the modern military. For example. Tanks have gone through more technological growth and devlopment in the past 100 years than any non military automobile and no kind of aircraft can compare to the speed of which fighter aircraft have been developing over the past 50 years. No ship in the world can compare to the multibillion aircraft carriers wirlding the latest detection, targeting and identification systems. The military funding is astonishing and every new kind of technolgy is alwasy there to be implemtned into military hardware. Wether it be peripherals, AI, materials, gadgets or even physics. It can be easy to say something like artifical intelligence, or quantum computing but in reality they are in their infancy. Quantum computing can be incredibly useful for the futurte but it has no practical use today. Right now quantum computer research is at its roots, were just getting started ready for when it becomes viable, cheap and better than the alternatives we have today so i wouodnt class that as the most advanced today. Artifical intelligence is definately up there but yet again its already being used within the military. AI is really new, really cool but yet still, in its infancy and i wouodnt count it as the most advanced. Right now almost nothing commercially can compare to military grade. ",

            "answer_text": "Can\u2019t say \u201cthe most advance\u201d but, i believe the growth in VFX (Visual Effects) and SFX (Special Effects) technology in movie making has been astounding in past few years. For those who don\u2019t know SFX are the effects which are physically created during filming of a shot, like bruises on face or bullet marks (makeup involved), blasting a car (if actually done). And, VFX are computer generated imagery applied to a live action footage during the post production of a movie. We love seeing them, because they take us to the world we otherwise couldn\u2019t ever visit. The first ever movie to handle SFX is basically a footage from \u2018Two ways of life\u2019 by Oscar G. Rejlander called \u2018The Execution Of Mary\u2019 in 1857!! Yes 1857! That\u2019s a long ago. Coming along towards 21st century, we came across Jurassic Park (1993) by Dir. Steven Spielberg, showcased digitally generated dinosaurs on big screen, which opened the mind to power the application of CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) in shots and exploited the possibilities of it. T-REX in JURASSIC PARK (1993)  Nowadays every single movie rely on the power of VFX, new techniques are being instituted by the studios such as Motion-Capture which enables to extract the performance of an actor (like expressions and movements) which is later applied to the animated characters. The highest grossing movie of all time (as per 2017), AVATAR (2009) by James Cameron, majorly scaled the use Motion-Capture, resulting in dynamic performance of the animated characters which feels identical to their real world counterparts.  Camera to the front enabled to capture performance (facial expressions) in real time. Progressing from simple 3-D animation to Motion-Performance-Capture in such short span is staggering. This advancement brought us many of our favorite characters to life on screen, like King Kong, Hulk, Iron Man, Caeser (planet of the apes) and many many others. Caeser from The Rise Of The Planet Apes.  Massive use of Green Screens during filming helps adding up to necessary details (especially landscapes) in the shot which makes totally impossible to exceptionally realistic. Here are some shots before and after affects. 300-Rise of and Empire    The Avengers  The Rise Of The Planet Apes  The Chronicles of Narnia   The Wolverine   Life of Pi  Doesn\u2019t end here, It\u2019s interesting and sad to know that now you don\u2019t need an actor to play. A fully Digital human can be easily created of same attributes. Young Carrie fisher in Rogue One  Young Steve Rogers in Captain America  ..are digitally created. Its notable to see that Carrie Fisher in Rogue one didn\u2019t really acted, but, to make performance feel rational, many other actor\u2019s performance was patched over her digitally created face and many of her reference videos were used. It doesn\u2019t end here too, Now comes the future i.e. VIRTUAL REALITY 360\u00b0 As VFX is the most expensive part of movie making, so live action movie in VR will cost hefty amounts of money as the VFX needs to be applied to 360\u00b0 but not just a bounded rectangle frame. Earlier in the days of movie making it nearly took 12 hr to render the T-Rex scene in Jurassic world, which now takes few minutes and comes up with astounding real touch. Tools such as Lytro Cinema, captures all the rays of light within a scene, providing a rich amount of Light Field data. Every pixel has color properties, directional properties, and its exact placement in space. Lytro Cinema is defying the traditional physics of on set capture by virtualizing creative camera decisions. Infinite creative choices can be generated in post-production including unprecedented control over focus, perspective, aperture and shutter angle \u2013 recreating impossible shots. That\u2019s where this technology is headed in such a short span, creating impossible! Source: Google Images & Lytro ",

            "answer_text": " I would go for this. It is a microcontroller with WiFi integrated and really small, being only 18x18x2.5mm.It operates with less than 0.3 watt and it is enough capable to stream images, do state of art cryptography, host a web server and communicate with other machines.It is also very cheap at 3$ in single quantities, but probably it will be even cheaper soon as it will flood in the market.   Xeon Phi series.That is Intel being taunted to make the most powerful processor they can make, and if you know the specifications of any Intel i7, any Xeon Phi make them to go in a corner in shame.  72 cores, TDP of an oven, 36Mb of cache, 384Gb of radiation proof memory addressable. Memory bandwidth bordering the insanity.This is made to eat whole hard disk of data, and spitting out trained neural networks. All day. On benchmarks it is not compared to other processors, it is compared to GPUs. Oh and all Xeons aren't made to work alone, but are heavily optimized to work in group with other Xeons.  GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Graphics Card 3584 cores.Clocked at 1.5GHz.33 millions of pixels of supported resolution.  And this beast is used for games.Not for solving hard science, or cracking the secrets of universe. Games! Of course it can be used also for science, there is indeed a well documented API, though it is marketed for gaming.  Ever wondered if you can design and try a brand new kind of computer processor? Or a kind of peripheral that sorts a limited array of n in constant time? FPGA  Stratix 10 - Overview Intel Altera FPGAs, are as close you can get to nanometer programmable matter. Field Programmable Gate Array is a fancy way to say that everything inside that big fat black chip is completely under your control. Want to stuff in 8 big CPUs or 256 adder cores? Within minutes you can try both. They can emulate any circuit at high speeds, manage hundreds of lines and emulate high speed peripherals like HDMI or USB3. One core application is to elaborate video filters in real time with no delay at all. There are even cheap ones starting at about 20 bucks.  Direct brain to computer interfaces  In the comments I heard complains like, \u201chey commercial things can't be the most advanced thing, right?\u201d. And they are right. Because research is ongoing to command computers with just your brain! The headgear in the image, I still haven't got a chance to use, but trying lesser capable versions, they do work and with minimal training anybody can drive a small robot with thoughts. Homepage - Emotiv With anybody I mean I've tested it on more than 150 people, with less than 5 minutes of training. It was possible with just 1 channel, where the headgear above promises 14 so theorically more complex commands could be given.  In general, it depends on what you consider important, but as an hardware developer I\u2019m quite filled with wonder every time I dig in data sheets and find that even cheap sensors indeed have inside tiny ad hoc microcontrollers.

            "answer_text": "To answer your question, we need to understand first what \u201cfuturistic technologies\u201d actually are. After all, any new technology could be described as \u201cfuturistic\u201d! My definition for \u201cfuturistic\u201d is that the technology changes the fabric of society in such a way that when future generations look back into the past, they can\u2019t understand how people lived and existed without that technology. The entire world has changed and fit itself around the new technology. Technologies that fit this criteria from the past would probably surprise you, since they seem so ordinary to us now. And yet, for the people living in the times they were invented and used, they seemed like magic - just like flying and autonomous cars, or general artificial intelligence, seem to us. A surprising example for a technology from the past that fit this criteria is aluminum production. Aluminum used to be one of the rarest and most expensive metals on Earth. Napoleon III used to serve his most prestigous guests food on plates made of aluminum. Then, towards the end of the 19th century, a new production method for aluminum was discovered, and the metal became ubiquitous and cheap within two decades. Today, aluminum exists everywhere: in your car, bag, oven, refrigerator, and many other devices. For people living in the 19th century, this would\u2019ve looked like science fiction - you\u2019re enjoying riches that not even the wealthiest of kings had in those times. Now, if I had to guess about the future (which I am lucky enough to be doing for a living pretty much every day), I would put my money on artificial intelligence (AI). It\u2019s already creeping into our lives everywhere: deciphering what you say to your digital assistants like Siri, Amazon Echo, Google Assistant and others; driving your Tesla car; making breakthroughs in science, and so on. My son is already talking with our Amazon Echo as if \u2018she\u2019 were a human being. He is going to grow up in a world in which everyone talks to machines all the time - and nobody would understand how people could live their lives before the machines could understand their words and even talk back.

On one end it boasts a chewable eraser-capped crimped metalloid barrel that is simply a genuine delight to sink your teeth into. Think you can do that with your iPhone?? No f**king way!  Next on the list of goodies is the woody frame that holds the lead. Besides rubbin\u2019 it between your fingers while jotting down sweet nothings, this high-fiber hexagonal casing is awesome for smoothing down the teeth previously sharpened while chomping down the metal encasing \u201cprotecting\u201d the frightened eraser:  But the best part has gotta be the lead! Man those mad pencil scientists really kept this a secret but now I am exposing it for you all to no!  The reason why wooden pencils were created in the first place (I guess) was for rich book-keepers (those mad pencil scientists) that needed a floating device for wiring up their encrypted net worth. You see, in those days, before the advent of BitCoin, you had to keep ledgers private in order to hide precious numbers away from prying eyes. So they invented the very first foldable snail-mail calculator made of paper and graphite (the lead of the pencil). This was so revolutionary as all you had to do was to draw your favorite calculation circuit with an HB pencil (HB pencil works best), connect current to endings, and voila: A light-emitting calculator ;-) Here is a much simpler circuit demo:  When they needed to modify/delete the paper-bound account info, all they had to do was erase or burn the diagram! Alas, the lead calculator story mentioned above, you guessed it, is hype ;-) but isn\u2019t the wooden pencil one of the world\u2019s most advanced tech as far as multi-tasking (chew, draw, electrify) goes? Surely beats Alphabet soup an\u2019 the expensive Apple! Take a look at this video for more about this pencil-driven paper lead circuit:  ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "Ten most advanced form of technology available in the world today- 1. The Internet- The world\u2019s largest and most unruly library, it\u2019s also a global news channel, social club, research archive, shopping service, town hall, and multimedia kiosk. Add to that the most affordable mass medium ever, and a curse to anyone with a secret to keep. 2. Genetic engineering- It might prevent birth defects, and diseases later in life. But the side effects could be disastrous and unknown. 3. Digital media- Digitized audio, pictures, movies, and text let even an amateur edit reality or conjure it from scratch with a keyboard and a mouse. A singer\u2019s bad notes, a model\u2019s blemishes, or an overcast sky in a movie scene can be fixed as easily as a spelling error. Just as important, digital media can be copied over and over nearly for free, stored permanently without fading, and sent around the world in seconds. 4. Personal computers- Technicians could use them to play games, keep diaries, and trade messages with friends across the country, while still looking busy. Today, thanks to the PC, we all look busy. 5. Space flight- The space race pushed the development of hundreds of enabling technologies, including synthetic fibers and integrated computer circuits, necessary to fly men to the Moon and back. 6. Mobile phones- One and cellular networks are beginning to serve Internet access at broadband speeds through thin air. 7. Nuclear power- Nuclear reactors were seen as a source of cheap, pollution-free energy. the United States today has about 100 active plants that generate 20 percent of the country\u2019s electricity \u2014 second only to coal as a source of power and have been steadily increasing their capacity. 8. Electronic funds transfer- Instantaneous transfers of millions of dollars in value between banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions had become common. The real appeal of EFT today is its trickle down to the individual: we get grab cash from your bank account anywhere in the world, and use PayPal to buy and sell stuff on eBay without sending money or checks through the mail. 9. Robots and artificial intelligence- The Massachusetts Institute of Technology founded its Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in a quest to mechanically mimic human minds as well as hands. Today, robots assemble products better, faster and often cheaper than manual laborers. 10. Organ transplants- The kidney from one human patient and implanted it in another. researchers developed drugs that could squelch a transplant recipient\u2019s immune system long enough for the new organ to become incorporated into its new body.

            "answer_text": "15. Solar Power Socket This socket attaches to your window and generates solar power to allow you to charge your laptop or smartphone before the battery runs out. You won\u2019t have to run around the house looking for a socket to charge your gadgets thanks to this little device. The solar powered window socket requires 5-8 hours to charge completely and lasts for 10 hours. That should give you plenty of time to get your work done and enjoy the view outside of your window. 14. Google Glass This is the gadget that has boosted Google\u2019s reputation since last year. The internet giant is making a move into the world of tech toys and it\u2019s quite a splash. Glass comes equipped with WiFi, Bluetooth and a camera that is capable of recording 720p videos. The Explorer Edition, worth $1500, was shipped to 8,000 lucky winners of the Google Glass competition and the general-release edition will hopefully be available this year with a price tag of $200-600. 13. Color 3D Printer The ProDesk3D is the world\u2019s first full-color 3D printer. The appliance alone looks beautiful and futuristic but it\u2019s capabilities are more than skin-deep. The printer has a unique five-color cartridge system which mixes shades to produce the exact color you want. The printer produces high quality 3D prints using its 25-micron dual extruder head and uses a tri-fan system to maintain constant airflow in the casing. 12. Portable Drum Kit Designed by Kevin Depape, the Y-Drum is the future of drum sets and the greatest learning tool for beginners. Air drums are ancient history compared to this amazing technology, as Y-Drum comes with a relatively portable carrying case that has built in speakers which make drumming a lot easier at any party you go to. The system can be connected to a computer for song recording and editing purposes. 11. Rotating Flash Drive Despite cloud storage, flash drives are still in high demand. The SanDisk Cruzer Orbit is a spinning flash disk available in 4GB to 32GB capacities, with the 32GB version costing only $40. The affordable price makes it accessible to the masses and its donut-shape means that it can be stored in any key ring, ring-binder or a lanyard without the fear of losing your precious data. Just as a flash drive should be. 10. Tunnel Toaster The Arzum Firrin tunnel toaster saves your fingers from getting burnt every time you pull the toast out of it. The toaster allows you to toast bagels, croissants and of course, bread and prevents any crumbs from accumulating at the bottom. Users can monitor their food from the open sides and pull the tray out once the desired level of toasting has been achieved. The Arzum Firrin toaster costs $72 and available in green, orange, magenta and silver colors. 9. Futuristic Candelabra Designed by Note Design Studio, the Teluria Candelabra presents an old form of lighting in a futuristic way. The device looks as if it\u2019s from another planet and was inspired by the Tellurion device which is used to show the movement of planets. At 18-inches tall, the device is available in a variety of colors from a wood-finish to a glossy baby blue and antique brass. A great mod-decoration piece. 8. Transparent Faucet The 1limit faucet, besides having an amazing design, is an amazing way to conserve one\u2019s water consumption. The see-through part of the faucet casing holds exactly 1-liter of water, which is considered substantial to wash one\u2019s hand. The lever on the faucet is used to turn it on or off. After the 1 liter of water has been used, the faucet must be turned off so that it can fill up before it is used again. 7. Futuristic Grand Piano The Poul Henningsen Grand Piano was actually designed in 1931 by Poul Henningsen when a Danish Jazz pianist told him how he could not see the bass player during performances due to the solid lid of his piano. This futuristic grand piano has a transparent lid which allows you to see through it and also gives you a glance at the amazing working going on inside the instrument. 6. Single-Stack Kitchen The modular island kitchen is designed by Massimo Facchinetti and is the future of kitchens. The kitchen not only conserves space but also energy. The green kitchen module is powered by solar panels and the water from the sink is filtered and reused in the dishwasher. The module includes a cooking range, microwave, a space to store the coffee machine and a vertical herbal garden where you can grow your own herbs. 5. Manual Coffee Grinder The body of this bean grinder certainly looks futuristic, and the cost of $900 would make people think that this is more than just an average coffee grinder. But the HG-One coffee grinder is a hand-powered, conical burr grinder. The fact that it uses no electricity makes it a \u2018green\u2019 product. The machine is also 95% recyclable by weight. The finishing and beautiful design are amazing and partly justify the insane price tag. 4. UHD-TV The days of HD televisions are limited now that Ultra HD TV\u2019s are here. The Samsung S9 is the world\u2019s largest production television and uses technology which give it a four times better picture than regular HD televisions. The 85-inch giant costs $40,000. The price may be reasonable to those who have compared watching the television to looking through a window. 3. Transparent LCD Television While Samsung is going for large and grand, the people at Haier are going for something a little more innovative. Haier\u2019s Designer Series Transparent TV is a completely transparent LCD TV. You have to make sure that there is nothing behind the screen when watching TV so it doesn\u2019t show up on the screen, but if you want to be a little more interactive with the program on TV, this device will let you do just that. 2. Hybrid Computer The B-Membrane hybrid computer was designed by Won-Seok Lee and the inspiration came from spaceship designs. The device lets users type, surf the internet and do other tasks they would on their conventional computer, all while projecting the screen onto a flat surface. Unfortunately for this design, the concept died after it was unveiled in 2008. 1. Flexible Smartphone Samsung\u2019s Youm is the world\u2019s first flexible and bendable smartphone. This groundbreaking technology uses OLED\u2019s that are flexible and almost indestructible. The phone features a Windows operating system and is the first of its kind. This doesn\u2019t come as a surprise since Samsung controls 90% of the market\u2019s OLED supply. The Youm is the first in a new generation of smartphones that will be more discreet and available in more forms than the traditional candy-bar layout. As well as the driverless cars \u2026and stuff etc ",

An example could be a personal VR (virtual reality) room in our home that allows us to visit friends without leaving our home. Another example is personal space travel, which is already available to some. Bitcoin replacing cash. A driverless car in every garage.

            "answer_text": "If you are fresh new to VR development, I recommend you to first try out one of the platforms that require no coding and have very small learning curves, just to get an idea of what \u2018developing VR content\u2019 looks like at a high level. ENTiTi Creator \u2014 Augmented & Virtual Reality Content Creation Platform Insta VR \u2014 Make your VR apps in Minutes Viar 360 \u2014 Create and Publish interactive cinematic VR experiences These platform provide tool sets for businesses in various industries to produce simple but high-quality advertisement/product demo/design visualization/training materials in VR/AR forms. You are probably not able to build fancy interactive functionalities with these platforms(but definitely the most basic ones such as drag-and-drop) that a good VR game might require, but you can surely learn a lot on how to import/create 3D assets, how to mess with a 3D object within a virtual scene, and how to customize your project with desired functions. Professional VR development, such as building an VR app/software/web, can be breaking down into several parts that would likely be done by different groups of people with different specialities - user experience design (storytelling, environment &interaction design, etc.), artistic design (3D modeling, animation, etc.), interaction prototyping, database management, and many other indispensable supporting parts. As you may unlikely master all of them, I recommend you to do some more research on what a VR development pipeline is like and dive more into part(s) that you are interested in the most. Personally I think user experience design is the least technical part and requires an interdisciplinary thinking on psychology, management, and creativity, as well as rich knowledge on what other people have tried and ability to evaluate why those approaches worked or did't work in a critical way. Fortunately, there are lots of good resources on user experience design in VR/AR development online: check this out. As for artistic design, for most part there\u2019s little to no difference to making a 3D animation/3D modeling, so if you had experience in these fields, it won\u2019t be hard for you to advance into VR! In case that you don\u2019t know much about 3D animation but are interested in learning about it to do VR development, I recommend checking blender out. To do interaction prototyping in VR, the base line is to master technical skills that are crucial to any kind of game development in general - OOP (object oriented programing) and making an efficient and easy-to-manage data abstractions. You should be able to handle several levels of abstraction (empirical, schematic, maths, algorithmic) before starting to code. But building a software in VR form adds many more challenges to interaction prototyping. Non-linear storytelling feature, need to respond to trackable equipments, and many other unique features of VR all requires the developers to make change to interaction logic flow in regular game development. As your product would likely involve multiple users and user generated contents, and thus, it\u2019s always good to check out Unity\u2019s manual on multiplayers and networking even before you start your first project, just to get an idea of what the final work should be like and technologies you need to learn about to manage your project effectively. To get a quick kick-off on VR development in general, check out our complete beginner guide to VR development.

One of his suggestions was that the development and trajectory of biotechnology could follow that of information technology. That is to say, moving from the domain of large research institutions and big corporations into the hands of the average person. Once that occurs, and more people become familiar with the technology and find ways to use it, to develop \u201capps\u201d as it were, then biotechnology would move from from the little-known and the controversial into the common, mundane and everyday. He was suggesting that this shift will occur over the course of this century\u2014not by tomorrow. It\u2019s a while since I read the article, and I don\u2019t want to misstate his arguments so you might want to read it yourself to see if you agree with him. I do think though that what can potentially be done in engineering biotech could be revolutionary, with far-reaching impacts. Our future might be in growing products, rather than in manufacturing them, for example. We could understand our microbiota in ways that would overturn much of our medical knowledge. We may be able to re-engineer ourselves, our children, and the world\u2019s ecosystems. That\u2019s a lot of ground to cover, and it isn\u2019t going to happen fast, which may be what you had in mind. ",

Even if we struggle for decades as we go about understanding which approach offers the best way forward (i.e., there are currently several different approaches under development by the big industry players and no one knows which of these will lead to \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d or if there might be several paths forward), the future may be stunningly unfathomable. This technology stands to make fusion power a reality. It might take another 50-100 years. But unlimited, super cheap energy will lead to unimaginable things. Buckle up, Dorothy. ",

Most of the technology we see as consumers is generally repurposed, in whole or in parts, from various government projects. These projects are either abandoned or outdated. For example, tablets were originally devised to give soldiers access to computers on the battlefield without the need for them to take off a backpack and unload a laptop. The first design was a long narrow tablet that attached to the forearm giving the soldier access to GPS data and communications. As far as I know, it didn\u2019t work out and years later we wound up with tablets and smart phones as a result. So, whatever answers you get here are probably far from being \u2018the most advanced\u2019 technology unless the person posting the reply has clearance or is a contractor. ",
