            "answer_text": "An observable is a Hermitian linear operator that can operate on system states describing something that can be observed. Unlike observables in classical physics most are not ordinary real numbers. The real numbers that can be observed by measurement of an observable are encoded into the operator as the set of eigenvalues* of that operator, which determine all the possible values that can be measured. The observables also encode the probabilities of observing different outcomes given the current state of the system. If two observables do not commute, then the observables are governed by the uncertainty principle.  * v is an eigenvalue of an observable L for some |s> that\u2019s a possible state of the system if L|s> = v|s> ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematically observables in quantum mechanics are hermitian operators which when acts on a quantum state gives any of its eigenvalue and state changes to eigenstate.For example position of a particle is an observable with its eigenvalues ranging from minus infinity to plus infinity for a free particle. It can assume any of possible value from a continuous set of values. On the other hand observables like spin angular momentum can assume any of only two eigenvalues.   Think of observables as a matrix .If this matrix is written in eigenbasis. Then the matrix is diagonal with matrix elements as eigenvalues. ",
