            "answer_text": "Oh but we can - in fact, water has multiple gravities. It has the most well known \u201cmake stuff go towards it\u201d form of gravity, which according to our best theory (General Relativity) is actually caused by the bending of spacetime due to the presence of matter, such that \u201cstraight\u201d lines actually become curved. Water is matter, and so curves spacetime in this way. But, it has another kind of gravity - \u201cspecific gravity\u201d (SG). This is a word for relative density, where the relative-ness is usually (but not by definition) measured by comparison with pure water. Pure water has a \u201cspecific gravity\u201d of 1.000 (SG is by convention measured to three decimal places), and sea water has an SG of around 1.025, meaning it is slightly more dense than pure water. In a purely poetic sense we could say that the sea has gravity, as it has been known to pull people towards it - the \u201cLure of the sea\u201d, which for many people is quite strong. Also in a figurative sense, we could say that deep water, the sea in particular, has gravity in the sense that it is a serious subject: many people lose their lives at sea every year, and the sea is something which we must always take very seriously, no matter how experienced we are (in fact, the more experienced people tend to take it more seriously, having experienced the \u201cgravity of the situation\u201d first hand). So, there you go. That\u2019s four reasons why we can say that water has gravity, and there may be more. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes water have gravity because every matter in the universe have gravity even though electrons protons and much smaller bodies have gravity, the difference is only that for them there gravitational effect are much smaller than their electrical or any other effects that causes them to look like they don't have gravitational effect, gravitational waves or Gravity. Water being the Mass has a very huge amount of gravity as compare to those little things but if you compare gravity of water as compared to Earth it would be different. Its up to You, how do you think how do you perceive things. ",

            "answer_text": "A small amount of water has almost no gravitational field. Nor does a small amount of dirt or a small rock. But, what gives an object a gravitational field is it's mass, so as the object's mass increases, it will have a higher gravitational field. You and I have gravitational fields, however small, similar to how water in space will have a gravitational field. But the fact is that it's mass is so relatively small compared to the earth and what's around it that other object's gravity severely overpowers it, thus giving it almost zero gravitational attraction.

In a scenario, a water drop in air attracts earth with the same force as the earth pulls the drop with. Mass of water is very less in contrast to the mass of earth, so water is accelerated more and moves faster. Earth also stirs, but very little. \u2018Gravity\u2019 is a special term to mean \u2018gravitational force or gravitation by earth\u2019. ",

And If you keep some 250ml of water side by it with some space between them after some time you can see the smaller mass water bubble will move and merge in 1 liter water bubble. ",
