Doesn't this break the E=MC^2 rule?<<< The answer is surprisingly simple IF\u2026 you leave the orthodox proclamation behind, a photon be somewhat, somehow some-thingyou accept that the photon is, as such, per se, neither a quantum ofthe materialthe property OF the materialNo, the photon is, as such, per se, the quantum of an action OF the material When we are see-ing some-thing, we are not seeing \u201cits light\u201d - we are indeed seeing some-thing, for an example the sun. When we are see-ing some-thing, this is tantamount to some-thing, called the \u201csource\u201d (the sun) communicating with a \u201creceiver\u201d (our eye) in that the source is transferring quanta of its property (mass and a priori aequivalent energy, respectively!) to the receiver. If it is our eye, the our brain elicits the awareness \u201cbrightness\u201d from/about the source. The light and every other electromagnetic irradiation is as such, it-self, on its own, in its own right, in its very essenceNEITHER a particle nor the property of a particlewhich leaves us with the remaining (realm) nature symbolized by \u201cirradiation\u201dwhich is the process, the action, the communicating between source and receiver, in other wordsthe transfer of mass and a priori corresponding energy respectively, from the source to the receiverSure is, the scientists are too arrogant and will rather bite their tongues off instead of providing the confession that irradiation is not by ANY means a \u201cparticle\u201d - ALTHOUGH they will readily admit that the Photon has not even a jota of rest mass to it lmao.

            "answer_text": "This is a typical misunderstanding of [math]E = mc^2[/math] The E here is the rest energy of an object. The full equation would be [math]E = \\sqrt{ (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2}[/math] This is the energy of an object of momentum [math]p[/math] and mass [math]m[/math]. A massive object with zero momentum has a rest energy of [math]E = mc^2[/math] A photon, however, has zero mass. The equation becomes [math]E = c p[/math] The energy of a photon is proportional to its momentum. ",
