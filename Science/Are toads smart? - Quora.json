            "answer_text": "No, not really. Frogs and toads both have very flat heads, and this is because of their small brains. When I put them infront of a mirror, they do not notice themself ar all. They are one of those animals that has many children to keep the species going, not by having big brains to survive. Out of around 4,000 eggs, only two American toads may survive. But don't be dismayed! This does not make them less interesting to watch. Part of the little guys charm are their dumbness. ",
