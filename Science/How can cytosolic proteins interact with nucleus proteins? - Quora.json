            "answer_text": "One example of how cytosolic proteins interact with nuclear proteins is that of importin, a type of receptor protein that binds to other proteins in the cytoplasm that have a nuclear localization signal (NLS) as part of their amino acid sequence.  Importin recognizes this signal and binds to it, forming a complex with that protein. Importin then mediates transport of the complex to a nuclear pore. Another transporter at the nuclear pore center then shuttles the complex into the nucleus, where importin interacts with a GTP binding protein called Ran. The interaction between importin and Ran releases the NLS-tagged cytosolic protein from importin, and the importin-Ran complex is exported out of the nucleus (via another transport protein in the nucleus) and hydrolysis of the Ran-bound GTP frees importin for reuse in the cytoplasm. This sounds complicated, but this is a very general example of how transport proteins interact with cytosolic proteins containing specific amino acids sequences acting as signals or tags for transport of said protein to an alternative destination within the cell.
