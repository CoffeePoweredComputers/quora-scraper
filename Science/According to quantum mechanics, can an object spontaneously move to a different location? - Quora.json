            "answer_text": "First of all by \u201cobject\u201d we usually mean something macroscopic. The phenomena you are referring to can apply to subatomic particles but for any macroscopic object the odds are so small that it is fapp impossible. Secondly the term \u201cmove to a different location\u201d is also misleading, that would not be what can indeed happen. It is more like a sudden quantum jump, with no \u201cmovement\u201d. A subatomic particle, say an electron, can be in more than one place simultaneously when it is not decohering with its environment. What can indeed happen is that at decoherence event A the electron manifests at location X and at the next decohrence event B it manifests at location Y, and X and Y can in principle be apart from each other a distance larger than what the speed of light could connect them. The electron \u201cappeared at one place, vanished and suddenly reappeared at a different place\u201d. This is the base behind quantum tunneling, but you must understand that the odds reduce enormously as the distance becomes minutely larger. In practice particles only shift position mostly on subatomic scale distances. ",

            "answer_text": "This action alone would violate the conservation of angular momentum. There is a coordinate system in which the object in question is in relative motion. The object has angular momentum about a point in this inertial frame. In order that angular momentum is conserved to all inertial frames, the center of momentum of a system must remain unchanged. The object can only spontaneously translate from one location to another if the center of momentum of the system, of which it is part, is conserved. Consider you are sitting in your 1 ton car, and suddenly find you ass hitting the pavement 10 yards away. This could be allowed if the car moved 1 yard the other direction. Don\u2019t try this on the freeway. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically, yes. But we're talking at the subatomic level. Imagine a bell curve where the first standard deviation is the length of a subatomic particle. How many deviations away is a meter? Indefinitely large by any standards. But it does say Douglas Addams was onto something when he came up with the infinite improbability drive. ",
