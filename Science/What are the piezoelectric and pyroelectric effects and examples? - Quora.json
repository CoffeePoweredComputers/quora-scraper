            "answer_text": "Piezoelectric effect is the ability of certain material to generate electric charge under the effect of mechanical pressure. For example quartz crystal exhibits piezoelectric effect. On the other hand, certain material generates electric charge when subjected to heat, this phenomenon is termed as pyroelectricity. The temperature change in the material results in the change of the position of the atoms which in turn causes polarization of the material. The change in polarization of the material causes electric charge generation. The example of pyroelectric effect is tourmaline crystal. ",
