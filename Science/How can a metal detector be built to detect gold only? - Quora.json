            "answer_text": "Most metal detectors have a setting known as Discrimination. There should be a knob or setting on the panel with this designation. Metal detectors work by sending ground penetrating radio signals into the earth; most of the time, these signals don\u2019t reach anything and dissipate. But since metal is often hard and dense, most metal objects can block the signal and send it back to where it came from. When the detector receives the signal that it sent, it will trigger the sensors and alert the user in some way. All metal of high enough purity is similar enough that a simple metal detector can pinpoint its location if it is only a short distance underground. On its default settings, a metal detector will give readings for all metals. So, this is where Discrimination comes in. The metal detector will always send out the same frequency, but the metals themselves are distinct enough in composition that certain types of metals will consistently give similar readings, readings than can be used to tell them apart. A solid steel nail will reflect more of the signal than a flimsy piece of aluminum foil. In a similar way, a precious metal like gold or silver will reflect the signal differently than a cheap metal like iron or tin. To further help a user identify the metal in the ground, many detectors will give different sounds for certain classes or types of metal. Of course, this is specific to each machine. By using the discrimination setting, one can configure a detector to only alert the user to signals received from precious metals such as gold. Check the detector\u2019s instruction manual to see which discrimination setting is ideal to find gold with, or if you don\u2019t have that, calibrate the detector\u2019s discrimination with different metal objects, one of them being gold, and play around with the setting until only the gold registers a signal and not the other objects. Hope this helps, and good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "So a classic VLF metal detector uses a coil to detect materials. The signal that coil produces, goes through the ground to reach the object, and then measure the signal that comes back. This is the most common metal detector and you can buy it form different brands but the principle is the same. So how can brands advertise a metal detector to be a gold detector? Simply because what they found out is.h That different metallic object has different magnetic fields around them when searching over them with the coil. This can then be transferred into numbers. And each brand uses a different type of display to showcase these numbers and what the material is. Also, this then allows a user to eliminate materials you don't want to search like scrap metal and trash (cans, screws extc.). But if you dig deeper into how metal detectors work you will soon found out that gold detectors really can find or detect only gold. However, there is something to take into consideration, they can still make mistakes and they can be pretty often. There are just too many factors that go along. For example the type of soil, the location on the earth's ground, the condition of the gold, the amount of gold in the ground, and many more. So when buying a gold metal detector you need to understand these factors, because at the end of the day you can be very disappointed. ",
