            "answer_text": "Ghost\u2019s existence or not: What does Science say about this? Let's get to know some information According to paranormal investigators, people remain on earth after death if they have suffered before death or if they have unsatisfied desires. In most cases, this expression occurs at night. In this regard, they say, \"The environment is quieter at night and the effect of electromagnetic energy is less (electromagnetic effect prevents the existence of the soul or spirit) which makes them more visible during the day than at night.\" Science does not believe in this miracle though. However, they could not completely deny this energy called Atta or spirit. According to Einstein, the greatest scientist of all time (Energy Never Disappears From The Universe), no force on earth can go beyond the Universe. The word can be explained more simply by the following theory  21 Grams Theory: - A scientist named Duncan McDonnell tested the weight of the Patient before death and re-examined the weight after death and noticed 21 grams less than before. When he told everyone about the matter, no one ignored his words. This is because weight loss can occur during various metabolic processes before death. But the truth of his words was proved in the mountains when various scientists repeatedly tested and found that the weight of the dead body decreased by 21 grams each time. This is the biggest tool for paranormal investigators to prove Attar's veracity. Because according to them, this 21-gram weight is actually the energy inside the body in the absence of which the body dies. According to paranormal investigators, the energy of the human body is always reflected which is absorbed in its daily use. And with the death of a person, the energy for which he is alive is absorbed in the furniture and objects around him. As a result, when we go to a haunted house, we get scared because there is a reflection of that energy. Hopefully in the future science will also give some more information or explanation in this regard ",

            "answer_text": "Science can already detect everything a human can, and much, much more. We can detect temperature changes to a tiny percentage of a degree, even remotely. We can detect movement in light spectrum much wider than the human eye can pick up. We can detect electromagnetic waves in a massive range of frequencies with such accuracy we can use the tools on stars hundreds of light years away. We can detect sound down well below the threshold of human hearing, as well as other vibrations. We can detect pressure with incredibly accuracy, radiation even down to a single decaying particle and much much more. We can build instruments that operate 24/7 - always alert; never tired, confused or surprised, and with 100% accurate memory, unlike humans. People have spent months and years setting up these instruments in places claimed to be haunted, trying to detect ghosts, with no definitive results. Any results found could not be repeated, and if it cannot be repeated, it is not science (generally, this means something was wrong with the experiment). Hundreds of spirit mediums have been encourage to summon spirits while being recorded. Nothing of note was found. There\u2019s three possibilities: Ghosts do not affect any instrument we are using. This seems unrealistic, as most claims of ghosts include movement, temperature changes and similar, which we could absolutely pick up.Ghosts are intelligent enough to spot the instruments - even hidden ones - and avoid them. If ghosts are meant to be deceased humans, this is also unlikely, as there is a lot of variability in intelligence, and one, somewhere, would mess up. Not to mention, with mobile phones we have reasonably accurate instruments everywhere.Ghosts do not exist. They are an artefact of human senses and memory, which are both easily distorted, given how powerful our imaginations are, and how poor some of our senses are.",

            "answer_text": "Had the existence of ghosts been proven by science? Not in the literal sense as in dead people walking about, but I believe science has explained ghosts as misfirings of the cognitive stystem. Now I don\u2019t believe in ghosts, but I have done ghost hunts because I wanted to understand why people do believe in them. So I was put in a room with a woman to sit fir an hour and record anything we heard or saw. We were both facing into the same room, I had windows behind me that I could see out of and see the footway along side the road. But we saw and heard very different things that night She heard and saw ghost children playing hopscotch in front of her between me and her, the children were laughing and joking like children do, she was absolutely convinced at what she had seen and heard. What I saw and heard, despite looking at the same piece of floor was very different, the woman was infront of me the other side of the piece of floor the children were playing on. I heard children laughing and joking too, but they were behind me, outside, when I turned I could see the children outside, real children, with their mother who was pushing a pram, thet were messing about as young children do. The woman told me what she had seen and the time she had seem it, I told her what I had seem at the same time, despite this, she refused to accept that what I saw accounted for the children\u2019s voices she had heard, she just responded with \u201cI know what I saw!\u201d. The human mind is very good at playing tricks and filling the gaps. On a ghost hunt you want to see ghosts, you hear voices, with no other information your mind can fill the gaps and you might \u201csee\u201d those children, even though it was clear those were real children outside. I believe that all ghost sightings are very complex hallucinations which can affect all the senses such that people can see, hear, feel, touch and smell these hallucinations, not real things, remember that everything we see hear and touch is just electrical signals, there is no reason why we can\u2019t have these signals without the corresponding stimuli. I have seem many other examples if this where the desire to believe or the natural susceptibility of a person to believe can have a marked effect on thier perception and understanding of external stimuli. Incidentally I have never seen a ghost, not even the ones that the people I was with saw. ",

            "answer_text": "I've long had an interest in ghosts. My sisters have had encounters.  One, as a child, saw a woman in Victorian clothing at my grandmother's very old flat in San Francisco.  She returned from the hallway asking the grownups who was that lady in the hall. The other was spending the night at our folk's place.  She woke from her sleep hearing what sounded like someone trying to unlock the bedroom door.  You may be familiar with the phony bedroom doorknob locks that can be popped open with a butter knife or flathead screwdriver.  Thinking it was our Mom, she called out.  No answer.  Anyways, the door opened and she could hear the bottom edge of the door rubbing across the nap of the rug.  She quickly took one step out of bed to turn on the overhead light and climbed back into bed.  There she sat trying to figure out what just happened.  Suddenly she heard, what she describes as \"a man's footsteps\" pacing at the foot of her bed.  That's when she got the hell outta of the room and, as she made her way to our folk's downstairs bedroom, she turned on EVERY hallway light, including a 50+ overhead entry light.  My Dad is a stickler for turning off lights, but my sister's story was so convincing all those lights burned all night long. One time, my mom woke up with a bad feeling.  The following morning my Dad learned his good friend had died. I've never had such direct contact, but while at my folk's home, I've seen things in the corner of my eye, which was so convincing that I turned my head expecting to see someone.  That, I've heard, is how most people see ghosts. Come to think of it, I have a buddy who would see movement out of the corner of his eye after his cat of 15+ years had died. I believe in science.  But there are some things that science still can't explain, such as how gravity works.  But, just because science can't explain it doesn't mean that gravity doesn't exist. There are just too many people that have claimed to have seen ghosts to dismiss the existence of ghosts so easily. When I retire, I plan to entertain myself with ghost hunting.  I probably should wear adult diapers, because I am easily frightened.  Oh, well. ",

            "answer_text": "After quick googling I found two interesting stories by researchers. Story 1 (Ghost in the fan): In a 1998 paper on natural causes of hauntings [PDF], engineer Vic Tandy describes working for a medical equipment manufacturer, whose labs included a reportedly haunted room. Whenever Tandy worked in this particular lab, he felt depressed and uncomfortable, often hearing and seeing odd things\u2014including an apparition that definitely looked like a ghost. Eventually, he discovered that the room was home to an 19 Hz standing wave coming from a fan, which was sending out the inaudible vibrations that caused the disorienting effects. Further studies also show links between infrasound and bizarre sensations like getting chills down the spine or feeling uneasy. Ghost in this story 19 Hz standing wave coming from fan. Infra-sound precisely. Story 2 (Ghost in the furnance) : In 1921, a doctor named W.H. Wilmer published an odd story about a haunted house in the medical journal the AmericanJournal of Ophthalmology. The family who lived in this haunted residence, called the H family in the medical literature, began experiencing weird phenomena when they moved into an old house\u2014hearing furniture moving around and strange voices in the night, feeling the presence of invisible specters. They report being held down in bed by ghosts, feeling weak, and more. As it turned out, a faulty furnace was filling their house with carbon monoxide, causing aural and visual hallucinations. The furnace was fixed, and the H family went back to their lives, sans ghosts. Deadly ghost carbon-monoxide. Have you ever tried magic mushrooms? Oh don\u2019t try, they contain a strong drug which causes hallucinations. If you are lucky you enjoy the trip else pray the god :D Likewise these mushrooms there are toxic gases produced by toxic molds can cause bad hallucinations. It is found that different kinds of toxic molds were grown at several haunted places. It is very hard to simulate the haunted places or haunted scenes to reproduce in a science lab to prove that ghosts don't really exists. PS: Different answers had already said these things. I only provided proven examples from internet. ",

            "answer_text": "Yet, there isn't.  In future, near or far, someone may come up with evidence or a mechanic which would explain these phenomenon, and may also end up solving a lot of other phenomenon that are seemingly inexplicable, 'therefore not real'. As of today, science of Psychology still has to explain why it is a science in Psychology 101 book prefaces, and it still does not have a solid, mathematically precise and accurate method, equation or mechanic which explains or describes the inner workings of Human psyche. We assume that parents and environment shape a child's psychology and behavior, however we are not able to explain how some ~5 year old kids can manifest murderous sentiments and intents without being exposed to any cultural influence to that end.  We cannot even start to formulate what makes an entity conscious, and what really separates us from tool-use capable Octopuses and Parrots, Crows who have apparent rational thinking and self-consciousness. Merely Alex the Parrot and Coco the Gorilla are enough to throw off many of our approaches and theorizations. Moreover, if you think it at a very base philosophical level, the continuance of the existence of the conscious entity's consciousness being tied to physical existence seems incompliant with laws of this universe:  In our universe nothing comes from nothingness or goes to nothingness, all matter/energy is converted to other states but not destroyed. Since consciousness is not something that is exempt from the laws of this universe or does not exist in another universe and manifest here as a guest, it cannot be destroyed either - just converted. And on the topic of that conversion: The consciousness of a conscious entity which was able to do SO big impact on its environment like what we do - ranging from massive constructions of complex structures to delicate works of art -, just transforms into decomposing organic matter which is incapable of any major impact to its environment like how it was a few hours before its death, does not satisfy the concept of conversion. If there was such a big potential in a given entity which could impact its environment in major ways, that potential must not diminish, but must be converted to something else of equal power, if different form. Proving it is another matter, discovering its mechanics, is another. These are what Science is for. Not for dismissing inexplicable things. ",

People can smell ghosts -- I can't tell you how many times witnesses have reported smelling perfume or a cigar when no source can be found. Smell is closely related to memory, so that scent may call up something specific in the case of a deceased loved one. People hear ghosts -- sometimes we hear disembodied voices in a location. And then, of course, there's actually seeing something. The ghost experience involves our senses. There's no way around it.

Most \u201cghost encounters\u201d (as well as most \u201calien encounters\u201d) happen during periods of sleep or drowsiness, and there\u2019s a good reason for that. About 30% of people are prone to periods of \u201csleep paralysis\u201d, where the person wakes up but is stuck in the same mental state as a period of REM sleep; you\u2019re stuck in a dream but you can\u2019t move, as your voluntary control over your body is turned off (or greatly diminished) during REM sleep, and if you were awakened by a nightmare, guess what? You\u2019re now in a living nightmare. This is why, when I hear somebody discussing a haunting, the first thing I start probing for is, \u201cWhen do these spirits show up?\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a report that doesn\u2019t somehow involve laying in bed or watching TV late at night. I mentioned \u201cenvironmentally caused\u201d because a lot of hauntings involve random sounds throughout a house. I\u2019ve mentioned before that one house, haunted by spirits that would walk around the upstairs at random times during the day, was actually being caused by a loose hot water pipe, so the \u201crandom times\u201d just happened to be \u201cwhen the hot water was being used\u201d. I also read a report of ghostly knockings being caused by people climbing up the fire escape outside. I have yet to experience anything observable that wasn\u2019t easily explained or even remedied. So, ghosts, simply put, don\u2019t exist, per the realm of science. This doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve been proven not to exist, just that all hauntings can be explained rationally. ",

No physical instrument can detect energy that transcends the physical spectrum. I like to use the example of the gifted Qigong healer John Chang. Physical instruments repeatedly failed to measure his Chi/Prana. So it is with spirits.  Science has its limitations. In the future there will be Super Science. Whereby the subtle, transcendent energies can be detected and measured. But this will not be done with physical instruments. It will be done with computerized batteries of subtle energy. So in the traditional sense, materialistic science will never have that capability. In light of that inherent limitation, people need to stop badgering the scientific community to accept something that they cannot detect, much less measure. Leave the mystical component of life to the mystics, not the scientists! ",

            "answer_text": "I should begin by saying that \u201cscientific evidence\u201d is probably the wrong place to begin answering your real or not real question. The basic scientific method is important, but it must be applied with an open mind. Many of us make a distinction between mainstream science and frontier science. Mainstream science is really good for the study of commonly accepted principles. But, the institutions supporting established science has a vested interest in being right. As of today, being right means that there is no such thing as nonphysical anything. With that said, the four conditions of my answer are that: There is a nonphysical aspect of reality. In the survival metaphysics I study, the physical is a product of consciousness, but there is a less complex model that is better supported by current study. That is, a subtle field of influence permeates the physical, sometimes referred to as the Psi Field. Important characteristics of the field are that it is nonlocal (no distance; everywhere is here) and that it acts as a medium of propagation for consciousness and thought.Mind is not the body. That is, our conscious self existed before this lifetime and will exist after this lifetime in a sentient form.People are naturally psychic in that they sense information in the Psi Field and express psi as information and influence (psychokinesis).Discarnate personalities (aka loved ones; supposedly dead people) are able to communicate with people still in the flesh by way of mind-to-mind psi expressions and psychokinetic influence on physical processes. (Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) for instance).These four conditions must be true for ghosts to be real. Realistically, \u201cproof\u201d is still being developed as research continues. Anomalous access of information (psychic functioning, mediumship) and mental influence of physical processes (EVP and changes of randomness of random processes) represent areas of research that tend to support Items 1\u20133. Item 4 is the most difficult to \u201cprove.\u201d The fact that people are able to psychically access information that appears to be present in the minds of still living people makes it difficult to say that a reported contact from a discarnate loved one did not actually come from someone's memory of the person. There is also the problem that we know of no way to shield from psi influence. Put another way, the information a psychic accesses could come from any place in the world, including a sealed vault or from a person deep in a mine on the other side of the world. The only psychically accessed information we might be able to say probably comes from a discarnate person is if the information is not known by anyone in the world. If the information is in the form of \u201cThat is something long-dead Uncle John might have said,\u201d it is arguable that something came from the mind of someone who knew Uncle John. An EVP recorded by Martha Copeland is an example of information that no one in the physical knew of at the time. You can hear it at Martha Copeland EVP on the Association TransCommunication website. So, while the four conditions above might be satisfied, there remains the human factor of the witness and the form the ghost takes. The best of the study and research seems to tell us that physical phenomena may be caused by a different personality, but must go through the witness. This appears to be the case for EVP, for instance. This is to say that we are the channel and we tend to color what we channel based on our expectations. If this is true, ghosts are not physically present. They are superimposed over the scene in our mind\u2019s eye. Ghostly physical effects are probably of the same sort of psychokinetic effects as we see in poltergeist phenomena. All of the (probably) required elements seem to be in place for ghosts to be real. They may not be proof of a discarnate personality. Much of what is popularly believed about ghosts is folklore. ",

They have been witnessed by people in every strata of every society everywhere on earth dating back to the beginning of written records.  There is no culture that does not know what a ghost is.

No one has ever shown that any other explanation, including all skeptical ones are supported by data that takes everything into account.

Taken as a whole, you'd have to be pretty arrogant to assume that every documentation is a fake and every person is either fooling themselves or a fraud.  You can't just declare that, you have to demonstrate scientifically how that can account for everything.  That has never been done and it's doubtful it can be. A scientific explanation for their existence?  That's rather easy.  They're conscious entities without bodies, which means that consciousness cannot be created or destroyed, which makes consciousness part of physics.  If you know anything about quantum physics, then you know that's not much of a stretch. ",

And let me share some of my understanding for the people who think stuff like science can\u2019t explain this stuff because science can only explain physical world and stuff. Science is not just some subject that was made so that people could have something to study in school, it is just a systematic, logical way to get an understanding of WHATEVER THAT EXISTS. If ghosts and spirits existed, there would already be a scientific field for it. If someone really believes that science is limited to our physical senses, really, what other senses do we really have? Gut feeling? Or perhaps, some other kind of feeling right? Cause people always say that you can only feel the spirits. Feeling is not a sense. It\u2019s just a phenomenon made by our brains to cope with some situations. When we hear some unexpected sound in our house on a late night, and we feel that there might be some intruder in the house, it\u2019s not because of any special sense, it\u2019s because of the feeling that our mind created based on the information that the brain has. It might have got this information from television or real life experiences. You get a feeling of things which are already in your mind, and not of what the reality is. People who believe in ghosts, so, will get the feeling that there is a spirit in their house. I hope I was able to make my point clearly and the purpose of this answer is really not to offend anyone. I respect the people, but I can\u2019t respect all the beliefs that people hold. ",

Let's assume also that they can communicate with each other, since that seems to be part of the standard lore about ghosts.

They could tell us who invented fire and the wheel. They could give detailed reconstructions of important battles and other historical events. They could fill in details about the real lives of Christ and Mohammed, and other seminal figures in history. They could give us fantastically useful and important information about many, many things. Creatures from another dimension? Well, they might not know this stuff, but there would be a ton of other vital and fascinating bits of information they could tell us. Now, let's look at the facts and see what alleged ghosts actually do give us:  Moaning soundsCold chillsRattling soundsBloodstained wallsDo you see the enormous discrepancy here between the incredible claims that are being made and the pathetic feebleness of the evidence being put forward to back up those claims?

If and when they can tell us something of value, then we can reconsider -- but I won't hold my breath. ",

If it was Scientifically accepted it would be part of the Normal world. A really good example of what I mean comes from another field often studied along side the Paranormal, which is Cryptozoology, the study of creatures that science does not recognize as real. For centuries possibly millennia, sailors claimed they had seen or been attacked by a large many tentacled creature referred to as the Kraken, Aristotle himself actually mentioned such a creature, calling it Teuthus. This creature and the subsequent tales of it were generally taken as myth. It wasn\u2019t until the 1800s that Mainstream science finally got its hands on a carcass and was forced to accept that it was a real creature now called Architeuthis dux. It left Myth and became \u201cNormal\u201d science. This is one of the things that keeps Sasquatch hunters going, knowing that science has in the past deemed a real living animal nothing more than fiction and myth, then forced to acknowledge it as real. In that same manner, Paranormal Investigators believe that it is only a matter of time before Ghosts and other spirits become accepted by science. Took a couple millennia for the Kraken to get itself recognized, will likely be many millennia before ghosts do, but its still worth many people\u2019s time to research and investigate. The Paranormal is only Myth and Legend until it is proven real, then it becomes \u201caccepted\u201d science. ",

            "answer_text": "A scientific explanation for ghosts would probably be different for each scenario, and generally impossible given limited second or third hand information. Generally speaking though, I would say it's usually either a natural illusion or someone trying to take advantage of someone else's superstitions.   The easiest explanation for the belief in ghosts is that people interpret their experiences in whatever way fits with what they already believe.  A very large percentage of people believe in some form of an afterlife, which in turns means that they believe in some sort of non-mortal soul that is separate from the body.  With such a prevalence, I find it entirely logical that many people would interpret \"unexplained phenomena\" to be attributable to \"ghosts.\"   Now what is interesting to me is that most religions don't actually say that there could be ghosts lingering around our world.  Usually, the afterlife is somewhere completely separate from here.  Yet, simply the thought of an afterlife gives people the license to believe in a sort of generic possibility of ghosts or spirits without having to explain how or why they could be present. Along with that is our own fear of mortality and wanting to live on, or wanting our loved ones to still be with us somehow, or people just liking the feeling of being scared. ",

            "answer_text": "we are obsesed with objective sciens but ghosts can only be seen using subjective science. For the last three hundred years or so, the world has been dominated by one type of science; objective science. This means the study of objects outside of the individual, hence objective \u2013 of the object. Objective science is great because you can conduct experiments or observations that can prove things, and you can repeat these so that others can see the efficacy of the findings. Biology, Chemistry and Physics are all objective sciences, and they have achieved so much. Before this time, for a period of many centuries, science was a mixture of superstition, local traditions and fear induced beliefs. If you go back further, thousands and thousands of years, mainly in Asian countries, there was another kind of science called subjective science. This is the scientific study of the subject \u2013 yourself. These days subjectivity is described as something negative and, compared with the evidence and proof of objective science you can see why. But you cannot study subjectivity in an objective way. How can the part study the whole? A man cannot dissect himself and if he did he wouldn\u2019t be alive to report the findings. In any case what he is searching for does not have a physical existence whether it is the mind or the heart centre. The first thing that you have to remember when undertaking a subjective experiment is to question whether it is your imagination that has made up the solution or whether it is indeed a subjective truth \u2013 a truth about your own past. This is remarkably difficult to explain but not so difficult to experience. And, of course, the experience can only be in the individual concerned. The experience cannot be shared because it is subjective. That\u2019s why some of the old saints have said that they can indicate the path but you have to walk on it yourself. Subjectivity is something that can only be experienced first hand. ",

            "answer_text": "When a man dies, he is called dead, but when he again appears in a subtle form not visible to our present vision and yet acts, such a dead body is called a ghost. Ghosts are always very bad elements, always creating a fearful situation for others. It is practically experienced. I know that the ghost, if you go in a house ghostly haunted, if you chant Hare Krsna mantra, they\u2019ll go away. They cannot tolerate. In my life there was several incidences like that. In my household life, I was doing business in Lucknow. So there was one house, very big house, worth thousands of rupees\u2019 rent, but it was ghostly haunted. So nobody would take that house. I took it at two hundred rupees, (laughter) and very big house. And I was\u2026 All the servants, they complained, \u201cSir, there is ghost.\u201d So I was chanting. He was living in several spots, especially on the gate side. So I could understand, but I would chant Hare Krsna, and I was saved. Everyone was saved. There was\u2026 And, say, in 1969 I was guest in the house of John Lennon in London. So there was a ghost in\u2026 It was a big plot. There was a guest house. So they complained, \u201cSir, here is ghost.\u201d So I advised them to chant Hare Krsna, and the ghost went away. Yes. This is fact. When there is Hare Krsna chanting, these ghostly, demonic living entities, they\u2019ll not be able to stay there. They\u2019ll go away. [750203BG.HAW] Those who are very sinful and attached to their family, house, village or country do not receive a gross body made of material elements but remain in a subtle body, composed of mind, ego and intelligence. Those who live in such subtle bodies are called ghosts. This ghostly position is very painful because a ghost has intelligence, mind and ego and wants to enjoy material life, but because he doesn\u2019t have a gross material body, he can only create disturbances for want of material satisfaction. It is the duty of family members, especially the son, to offer oblations to the demigod Aryama or to Lord Visnu. From time immemorial in India the son of a dead man goes to Gaya and, at a Visnu temple there, offers oblations for the benefit of his ghostly father. It is not that everyone\u2019s father becomes a ghost, but the oblations of pinda are offered to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu so that if a family member happens to become a ghost, he will be favored with a gross body. However, if one is habituated to taking the prasada of Lord Visnu, there is no chance of his becoming a ghost or anything lower than a human being. In Vedic civilization there is a performance called sraddha by which food is offered with faith and devotion. If one offers oblations with faith and devotion\u2013either to the lotus feet of Lord Visnu or to His representative in Pitrloka, Aryama\u2013one\u2019s forefathers will attain material bodies to enjoy whatever material enjoyment is due them. In other words, they do not have to become ghosts. [SB 4.18.18] The word eka-pada, \u201cone-legged,\u201d refers to ghosts, for it is said that ghosts walk on one leg. [SB 4.29.2] Because of his desire to enjoy the material world, the living entity is dressed with the material gross and subtle bodies. Thus he is given a chance to enjoy the senses. The senses are therefore the instruments for enjoying the material world; consequently the senses have been described as friends. Sometimes, because of too much sinful activity, the living entity does not get a material gross body, but hovers on the subtle platform. This is called ghostly life. Because of his not possessing a gross body, he creates a great deal of trouble in his subtle body. Thus the presence of a ghost is horrible for those who are living in the gross body. [SB 4.29.6] Sometimes the living entity is forced to give up his body and enter another one according to the judgment of Yamaraja. It is difficult, however, for the conditioned soul to enter another body unless the present dead body is annihilated through cremation or some other means. The living being has attachment for the present body and does not want to enter another, and thus in the interim he remains a ghost. If a living being who has already left his body has been pious, Yamaraja, just to give him relief, will give him another body. Since the living being in the body of the King had some attachment to his body, he was hovering as a ghost, and therefore Yamaraja, as a special consideration, approached the lamenting relatives to instruct them personally. Yamaraja approached them as a child because a child is not restricted but is granted admittance anywhere, even to the palace of a king. Besides this, the child was speaking philosophy. People are very much interested in hearing philosophy when it is spoken by a child. [SB 7.2.36] After giving up the body, one is transferred to another body, but sometimes, if one is too sinful, he is checked from transmigrating to another body, and thus he becomes a ghost. To save a diseased person from ghostly life, the funeral ceremony, or sraddha ceremony, as prescribed in authorized sastra, must be performed. Ravana was killed by Lord Ramacandra and was destined for hellish life, but by Lord Ramacandra\u2019s advice, Vibhisana, Ravana\u2019s brother, performed all the duties prescribed in relation to the dead. Thus Lord Ramacandra was kind to Ravana even after Ravana\u2019s death. [SB 9.10.29] We have heard of people\u2019s being haunted by ghosts. Having no gross material body, a ghost seeks shelter of a gross body to stay in and haunt. The Sakatasura was a ghost who had taken shelter of the handcart and was looking for the opportunity to do mischief to Krsna. When Krsna kicked the cart with His small and very delicate legs, the ghost was immediately pushed down to the earth and his shelter dismantled, as already described. This was possible for Krsna because He has full potency. [SB 10.7.9] If a man becomes disappointed and he cuts his own throat or hangs himself, some way or other, eats some poison, to finish, does it mean that he is finished? Na hanyate hanyamane sarire. He is rascal. He does not know. By finishing this body he is finished\u2013no, that is not possible. The result is, because he violated the rules of nature, he becomes a ghost. That is his life. One who commits suicide, he becomes a ghost. Ghost means he does not get this material body. He remains in the subtle body, mind, intelligence. Therefore ghost can go because he is in the mind. Mind speed is very strong. If you have got this material body, you cannot go immediately hundred miles off. But if you are in the mental body, you can go immediately, thousand miles immediately, within a second. So the ghost, they can play something wonderful because\u2026 But they are not happy because they have no gross body. They want to enjoy. He\u2019s materialist. He has committed suicide for some material want. So he is want of material\u2026, fulfilling material desire. He could not fulfill in this body; therefore commits suicide, but the desire is there. The desire is there, and he cannot fulfill it. He becomes perplexed. Therefore the ghost create disturbance sometimes. ",
