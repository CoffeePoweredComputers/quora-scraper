            "answer_text": "Why is it important to study sociology? Is sociology considered the mother of social science disciplines? How is sociology interrelated to other social science disciplines? As a practicing Sociologist, my answer is very biased. How is sociology interrelated to other social science disciplines?Sociology was derived from Anthropology which is as study of humans, human behavior and societies in the past and present, whereas Sociology is the study of the development, structure, and functioning of human society. Close, but different concentrations. My minor was in Cultural Anthropology. My specific area of study and practice is concentrated on the interaction of cultures within society - specifically the array of original First Nations cultures/societies as they interact with the dominant European- based society. Why is Sociology important?It is my firm belief that by having a better understanding of people and their cultural structures and sub-structures (society) in any specific geographical location, we can reduce or eliminate inter-cultural / inter-societal friction (AKA: bigotry / prejudice, etc.).Key to this practice is \u201cCultural Safety and Humility\u201d - the internal acceptance that you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, leading to a curiosity of how to better understand another culture (at the heart of it is simply by asking \u201cis this OK with you\u201d) in your personal, business, social interactions.
