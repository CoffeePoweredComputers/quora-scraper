            "answer_text": "Well, frankly who knows? But I think a lot of government health units chose that number because they\u2019re trying to do something about the growing levels of physically unfit obese people, given the cost of taking care of them as the years go by. I always remember our vet saying to us \u201cfat dogs keep me in business!\u201d Yup, a stark reality about how chronic overweight and high body fat percentages will wreak havoc on biochemical bodys!!! When you think about it, 30 minutes sounds do-able for sedentary people who are contemplating exercise. Personally I like to exercise 60 minutes daily for anywhere from 4\u20136 days weekly. And I do about 80% resistance/weight anaerobic training and about 20% aerobic exercise. ",

This adds up to 30 minutes of exercise Monday through Friday. That\u2019s all. However, 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week is also a common health association recommendation. Meaning 25 minutes of intense exercise Monday, Wednesday, Friday (or whatever split gives you a day of recovery). The \u201cmagic\u201d amount of exercise is the amount of exercise you\u2019ll actually do. ",
