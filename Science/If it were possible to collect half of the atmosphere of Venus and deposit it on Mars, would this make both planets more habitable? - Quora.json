            "answer_text": "I will assume that the OP is referring to the present-day versions of these planets (both planets were likely very different worlds during the early days of the solar system). I am also assuming, optimistically, that it may be possible to evolve life that can withstand very high CO2 levels. Still, the quick answer to this question is likely \"no\" for both worlds. Venus is the solar system planet most akin to a real hell, with temperatures exceeding 800 F, hot enough to melt lead. The current day atmosphere (with a surface pressure > 90 times that at Earth's surface) however was likely the result of the different evolutionary path Venus took in earlier times compared to that taken by our Earth. With a solar insolation nearly twice that received by our planet, Venus was likely too close to its Sun, which would have increased surface temperatures to the point that the atmosphere expands, causing water vapor to readily evaporate and moisten the upper atmosphere. The enhanced solar extreme ultraviolet rays at these higher altitudes would have driven escape, leading to massive losses of the water vapor to space. One idea is that as Venus' early oceans were escaping , plate tectonics shut down (as water may be needed to reduce friction in plate movement). This is because without sufficient rain to draw down the CO2 being belched by volcanoes, CO2 would preferentially remain in the atmosphere.  Thus, much of the CO2 in the Venusian crust simply ended up in the atmosphere (the opposite situation to what had occurred to the Earth). This readily explains the high density and dryness of the present Venusian  atmosphere. The above explanation also sets up the point that water is likely needed for habitability (life), as least as we know it on the Earth. If that is indeed true, simply removing half of Venus' ~92 bar atmosphere and putting it elsewhere will not significantly enhance its habitability. First, the surface pressure  would still be a crushing 46 bar! Moreover, life would be very hard-pressed to take hold in such a dry environment. In the case of Mars, the predominantly CO2 atmosphere is much thinner (~6 - 7 mb on average) and there appears to be abundant water ice locked within the crust and ice sheets. However, 46 bar of CO2 transported to Mars is probably too much, likely leading to temperatures that may be too hot for life (>370 K or s0), assuming that the atmosphere becomes wet enough  to prevent atmospheric collapse first. Consider that at present day solar insolation (S/So =1; see Figure below), and assuming an atmosphere with 100% relative humidity, only  ~1 bar of CO2 is required to achieve clement above-freezing mean surface temperatures.    From Page on nature.com Even so, the lack of a magnetic field may pose a challenge for life due to enhanced surface radiation if the atmosphere is not thick enough. Additional terraforming measures may need to be undertaken to maintain sustainability over geologic timescales as the atmosphere is slowly but gradually eroded by the solar wind. ",
