            "answer_text": "As others have said, it is possible to knock up a simple game over the weekend - but you\u2019ll need at least a game designer, a graphic artist and a programmer. However, that gives you the basics, and not the UX (user experience you are probably looking for). From building about 20 such games, we\u2019ve found there certainly is a recipe, and yet still recommend 3 months to allow for: 2 weeks to build the initial prototype (just the basic features and functions)4 weeks to build the secondary prototype2 weeks to tweak from initial user feedback4 weeks to polish and build the MVPThen its a lifetime of support and improvement and updates! If you are looking specifically for mobile VR games, then you can typically knock them out a little bit quicker than a Vive/Oculus game - because the phones are used and interacted with in different ways. Yet 3 months is still a good recommended amount of time. To explain further, a couple of years ago we figured out a unique movement for mobile VR and so decided to build a game to utilize this special feature. We subsequently built our initial version of the mazewalkvr in a few days. Pushed it to the iOS app store for free. We got feedback, then spent about 2 weeks improving, and pushed another version. We got more feedback, added a few more levels and more functionality and pushed again. We then spent the next few months improving, adding, tweaking tweaked, listening, tweaked some more and more and more! We\u2019ve now got over 2 Million downloads on iOS, but please note that it is forever a work in progress! Here are some iamges of iterations and another version coming out any day.  We also build fully immersive hyper realistic games for Vive and Oculus. For this level of detail, its more like 3\u20136 months (sometimes more). However, when you get in the realm of realism the problem isn\u2019t the game creation, it\u2019s with the limitations of the real-time gamer play and more specifically the limitations of the headsets. However, with perseverance you can get there. Here\u2019s an example from one of our latest solutions that took about 3 months to build and an additional 3 months to perfect.  Oh and finally and possibly most importantly\u2026 it takes friends, family, business partners, a great team and a lot of user testing - without these key ingredients, you\u2019ll be left with merely a half decent idea!

Like: How big is the teamHow much you are skilledHow many free time in the day you have to build the gameWhich kind of game you want to doHow many features you want from your gameWhich is the required graphical an polishing quality of the experienceetc\u2026Making a VR game needs not that much time more than doing a standard 3D game. So you can look for stats about this kind of games and make your mind about it. Just to give you a stat: for a 5minute super-high-quality experience for an exhibition, we evaluated in working in 11 people for 4 months (not full time, and included project-managers and all stuff) ",
