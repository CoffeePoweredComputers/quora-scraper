            "answer_text": "The methods for the determination of the purity of drugs is actually explained in excruciating detail in International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Q6A and Q6B. The FDA will also have even more details in CFR 610.13. Let\u2019s start with what actually is being measured. When you\u2019re measuring purity, you\u2019re not really interested in how pure the drug is. You\u2019re really interested in how impure the drug substance/product is. In other words, it\u2019s the contaminants that you\u2019re really concerned with. The question about the drug\u2019s activity generally gets tested when the potency is examined. However, when purity is evaluated, you\u2019re largely concerned about controlling the impurity profile of the drug and knowing what effect do those impurities have. Generally, the identify of the drug substance should be measured using a specific method. Fingerprinting methods like IR are considered specific. Chromatography is generally not considered specific but when used in combination via two separation techniques, identity can be confirmed. HPLC/UV, HPLC-MS are both mentioned as examples. ICH Q6A explicitly outlines a few panels of tests that should be evaluated. MicrobiologyExtractablesParticle sizeDissolution or disintergrationIn addition, knowledge about the drug becomes important. Impurities caused by the degradation of the drug. It can also come from ingredients that come from the process itself. There are semi official decision trees used to characterize impurity testing. Decision Tree #1: Establishing Acceptance Criteria[1]  The most notable impurity would be the introduction of microbes. There are a lot of in-process methods to evaluate microbial contamination throughout the process but the final measurement will have patient impact. Other checks of sterility would generally be performed especially viral and mycoplasma. Impurities caused by microbes but won\u2019t be seen due to the depth of the bug will also cause issues like endotoxin and pyrogens. Other impurities would come from ingredients added during the process. Substrates like additional proteins and precursors will need to be removed. Additives like inducers and viral inactivation detergents would also need to be removed. Extractables and leachables from product contact with holding vessels may cause an impact to the patient. For biologics, there is a particular concern about any animal-derived raw materials used in the process and the source of origin is carefully examined. The other class of impurities would be product-related impurities. These are impurities that come from the drug itself namely variants. The drug may degrade into inactive forms or hyperactive forms and tests should evaluate the presence of those alternative forms. Likewise, if the drug is chiral, those variants should be measured too. Actual purity can be measured too. Bioactivities assays are one method to look at \u201cactivity per unit\u201d. This is one way how a drug can be greater than 100% pure.  Now for the actual tests. To first test a drug, it needs to be evaluated against something else. Generally, a reference standard of the drug is created as a benchmark. Reference standards are an evolving subject which is why Pharmacopoeia spend a lot of time evaluating them and there is a ton of regulatory activity attempting to establish consistency with reference standards. All of these tests would be validated and each test would have a predetermined specification based on both scientific understanding and clinical history. One of the challenges of biosimilars development is that the competing company will often have no idea what the tests and the specifications are and they will need to first develop these methods from scratch. In the biologics world, there are a variety of biophysicochemical methods to evaluate purity. At one extreme, there is a complete structural characterization of the molecule via mass spec. There are then other physicochemical tests. As mentioned, separation methods like isoelectric focusing, size, electrophoresis, LC, and spectroscopy are all used to physically characterize the drug. Depending on the impurity, you\u2019ll need different tools. Truncation can be readily found using SEC and peptide mapping. Isomers can be found using charge separation. Aggregation can be identified with non-reduced methods. All of these tests will have both a release method and a release specification.

            "answer_text": "To add on Erick\u2019s answer, there are several key techniques that are widely used in the industry. I\u2019ll still assume we\u2019re basically still talking about a chemical here. Liquid chromatography, which is extremely widespreadGas chromatography, when dealing with volatile compounds or impurities, also very common, especially for residual solventsthin layer chromatography, becoming a little outdated but still used in many applicationsInfrared (and occasionally UV) spectroscopy, mostly for qualitative purposes and part of almost all ID testing for a given compoundNMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy, quite important todayAtom spectroscopy techniques, such as ICP (inductively coupled plasma) and AAS (atom absorption spectroscopy). Those are often used to determine elemental impurities like heavy metalsAssays by titration, may sound old fashioned but are widely usedlots of other wet chemical methods to determine water content, inorganic residue, total volatiles (loss on drying), anions and cations, total organic content etc.Of course, the above list is not exhaustive by far. Also keep in mind that all chromatographic techniques are \u201conly\u201d separation techniques and are not complete without some kind of detector. Widely used detectors here are based on UV absorption, mass spectrometry, flame ionisation (for volatile organics), refractive index or conductivity. Again there are a whole lot of other detectors, which can be used in more special cases. I\u2019d estimate (very roughly), that with the above mentioned techniques you might be able to cover about 80%\u201390% of the needs of a typical chemical company. When you move to e.g. biopharmaceuticals, say synthetic antibodies, specialized microorganisms, proteins, viral vectors etc. you may need a very different toolbox though. ",

To determine the composition you can either use the manufacturer\u2019s manuals or perform a qualitative chemical analysis. Secondly, there should be a certain standard against which you test the level of purity in the given drug. Having the information above, you are good to go. ",
