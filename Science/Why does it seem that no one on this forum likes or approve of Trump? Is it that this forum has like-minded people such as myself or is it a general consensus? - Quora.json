            "answer_text": "I have found this forum to be quite Anti-Trump. Sad, because he has done a great job in his first 3 years in the White House. He has delivered on the promises he made to the American People and is a very strong proponent for religious freedoms, unborn lives, the advancement and prospering of all American Citizens, worked with Black Americans to create a Platinum Plan for raising them out of poverty and into greater opportunity, he passed Family Leave Act Laws for Federal workers to get paid up to 12 weeks to care for a newborn, he passed the Great Outdoors Act. The Trump Administration worked with Congress to secure the passage of this landmark conservation legislation, which will use revenues from energy development to provide up to $1.9 billion a year for five years to provide needed maintenance for critical facilities and infrastructure in our national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, recreation areas, and American Indian schools. It will also use royalties from offshore oil and natural gas to permanently fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund to the tune of $900 million a year to invest in conservation and recreation opportunities across the country. Perhaps you are not familiar with all that he has done. After all, President Trump was a businessman before he became President. As a private citizen, he made his money BEFORE he was elected President. He does not take his quarterly salary but instead donates it to charity. Last quarter to Wounded Warriors. Believe me, the problems in government began many decades before President Trump was ever elected. Career politicians used and abused our system and our hard earned Tax Dollars. Proof is evident. Most Americans are having a hard time getting by, we work and pay our taxes but what does it get us? Our Representatives have somehow managed to give themselves raises every year. They are supposed to work for us and yet they are the ones living in mansions that they acquired while working for us. Our roads are still a mess, our cities are burning and what are they doing about it? Instead of negotiating stimulus, the House Leader want to add millions of dollars of extra padding to help her croney buddies. Isn\u2019t it about time that those career politicians give an account to the American People for how they spent our money. You know that if Joe Biden is elected, he has guaranteed that he will raise taxes. Here we go again! ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion it\u2019s a combination of the platform having more people who dislike Trump, and Trump being an asshole. He\u2019s done some good things, which people with Trump Derangement Syndrome deny, but he\u2019s done a lot of bad things and apparently enjoys offending people. Take the fake impeachment attempt - instead of trying to impeach Trump for actual impeachable offenses, they tried to impeach him based on false accusations. Probably because the establishment are as or even more guilty of the things Trump could legitimately be impeached for. As for racism, he says racist things to offend people, but there is a reason the Democrats praised him for decades for hiring women and minorities, and paying them the same as he paid white men in similar positions. The only color Trump really cares about is green. If you oppose Trump for racism, what justification do you have for voting for Biden? If you oppose Trump for sexism, what justification do you have for voting for Biden? If you oppose Trump for corruption, what justification do you have for voting for Biden? If you oppose Trump for making our environmental crisis worse, what justification do you have for voting for Biden? If you oppose Trump for not giving us health care, what justification do you have for voting for Biden? If you oppose Trump for, well, anything, really, aside from being rude and obnoxious, what justification do you have for voting for Biden? Biden himself tells you to vote for Trump if you care about any issue. The problem is that as horrible as Trump is, the Democrats have once again chosen someone worse. \"Most democrats can't tell you why they're democrats, they just hate @realDonaldTrump, they can't even tell you what Biden did in 47 years but they're going to vote for him\"Blexit smashes the narrative during their march to BLM Plaza in DC.FULL VIDEO: https://t.co/HvC1lxnQfd pic.twitter.com/Q9jAn842cY\u2014 Essential Fleccas \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@fleccas) October 15, 2020\n ",
