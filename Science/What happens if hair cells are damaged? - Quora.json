If hair cells are damaged in any way, we suffer permanent hearing loss or balance degeneration .New research , however, is showing that there may be a way to regenerate damaged hair cells. Hair cells in the ear may die from exposure from loud noises over a period of time. Loud noise can damage cells and membranes in the cochlea. ",
