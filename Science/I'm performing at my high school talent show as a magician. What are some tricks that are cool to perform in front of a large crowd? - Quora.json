            "answer_text": "This is a question I get a lot. I\u2019ve compiled a list of 5 effects and written a detailed response below, it appeared in a magazine recently so that\u2019s why the voice is a little funny. If you don\u2019t want to read it I have included a video as well that basically covers the same info. What kind of magic can you perform in a talent show? This question comes up a lot. For those who ask, it may be their first public performance and it will likely be for a whole bunch of strangers who have never seen magic before. I\u2019ve compiled a few effects that would work great on stage for a talent show and I\u2019ll get to my list in a moment, first let\u2019s talk about what kind of magic works in this environment. Okay, so you have been practicing and maybe even performing a bit. You need some flight time performing on stage so that you can take your magic to the next level. I believe that the sooner you can get time on stage the better. Of course, this means that you need to be extra rehearsed because there is a lot on the line! You also need to make sure that you have a routine with a beginning, middle, and end. For your family and friends, you can perform a quick trick and get a great reaction. On stage, you need to take some time to introduce yourself, establish a presence, build up the effect and deliver. It sounds daunting, the stakes are high, but I\u2019m going to help you out. Additionally, a talent show is usually on a stage of some sort. It may be for everyone at your school or a few hundred people from your community. This means that the magic you perform needs to play big. It needs to be big so that your audience can see what you are doing but it might be bigger than you are used to. An ambitious card routine is an excellent piece of walk around magic but you need to translate the magic so that it plays for a large audience. You need to make sure that everyone experiences the magic together. I have made an effort to choose magic that caters to all of those needs. I recommend only doing one or two of these effects for a talent show. Usually, you won\u2019t be asked to perform for more than five to seven minutes and it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 but, you want to leave your audience wanting more. This list is mostly made up of classic magic. Why? Because it works, it\u2019s accessible, and you could use this magic to help you start to create a full-fledged stage show if that\u2019s what you want to do. Fizz Master This is the easiest effect to perform in the bunch. It is also one of the most unique tricks that you could do. All you need are two ungimmicked cans of soda pop. One is shaken and the fizz magically travels to the other. It\u2019s that clean and it feels like real magic as you do it. Two great places to learn it are in the solo release that was recently put out by Paul Harris and Eric Mead, or in The Secrets of Magic by Rick Lax. Both of these are incredibly inexpensive options but I first read about it in Art of Astonishment Volume 2 by Paul Harris. This book is chock-full of amazing material performed on television by the likes of David Blaine, David Copperfield, Luis DeMatos, and Lance Burton. So I recommend you buy it for Fizzmaster and study it for all of the other amazing material!+* The Invisible Deck The invisible deck is considered by many to be one of the greatest card tricks of all time. A freely selected card reverses itself in an isolated deck of cards. There are many great approaches to this effect but for the purposes of a talent show on a stage, I like the idea of performing with a jumbo deck of cards. Dan Harlan\u2019s Jumbo Invisible Deck PRO is the routine that I would recommend to anyone who needs five minutes of killer magic. The entire routine progresses simply and logically which makes it easy for you to do. There\u2019s a ton of byplay with your audience that is a lot of fun, and the reveal is unbeatable. Professor\u2019s Nightmare Rope tricks pack small and play huge. This effect, like the invisible deck, has a built-in routine that is entertaining and engaging. The magic happens in stages, first the ropes become the same length then they turn back into their original lengths. Arguably the best version of professor\u2019s nightmare out there is Michael Finney\u2019s. His is taught on the Professor's Nightmare DVD by L&L Publishing. This is a great resource for this trick that offers several approaches and handlings. Six Card Repeat This is a staple in many professional routines and it works great on stage with only a small stack of cards. The magician announces that he needs six cards for this next trick and has a comedic time just trying to gather the correct props. The cards vanish and appear out of the control of the magician. Dan Harlan\u2019s video Tarbell course covers several versions of the effect. You can find it all in Tarbell Lesson 73. The Levitating Cane The Invisible Deck and Professor\u2019s Nightmare both offer easy to remember scripts. You don\u2019t want to be caught on stage without anything to say so those are great options. For the performers who prefer to not speak, you will want to check out the Dancing Cane. This is a levitation of a cane that can be controlled by one person on stage. David Copperfield, before he was a household name used a version of this routine to launch him into stardom. Forty years ago it gave him a huge reputation, not a lot of people are doing it today so it could be the kind of thing that gives you a huge reputation as well. The Floating and Dancing Cane by Lewis Ganson is the resource that I recommend. This book expands on the plot of the dancing cane and shows how you can levitate many different items. This is a classic piece of magic but the effect, when done right, looks like hardcore straight up wizardry. Use these as pieces to launch your own stage shows. It\u2019s difficult to gather good material for inexperienced stage magicians so while you experiment with material, it\u2019s good to have something solid to fall back on. Also, all of these pieces can easily be updated or changed to fit your style and I recommend that you customize each piece to fit you.  ",

            "answer_text": "What effects have you already mastered?  Go with those, don't try to learn something new at the last minute. What have you got that can BE SEEN by a large crowd?  Don't even think about a card trick... the deck is so small it will be almost invisible on stage.  You need something that can be seen from the back row of the theatre. Speaking of which, will you be on a stage?  If you're performing at floor level, it will be even tougher for people a few rows back to see what you're doing.  You'll have to hold everything at chest level or higher. Will you be miked?  If they can't HEAR you, they can't enjoy you.  Will the mic be on a stand?  A lavalier?  Hand-held?  A hand-held microphone works well for a singer, but magicians generally need BOTH hands when they work. How long will you be performing?  If you've only got a few minutes you may just want to choose one single killer effect.   Are you a competent, engaging speaker?  Do people enjoy hearing your voice?  Then by all means, use patter during your spot.  Is your voice not your strong point?  Perhaps you should present some Routined Manipulation set to music. You know the song \"It Ain't What You Do, It's the Way that You Do It\"?  Absolutely true!  Don't worry about what effects you present, focus on how you'll present them.  I've seen $17,000 illusions performed poorly, and the audience applause was perfunctory.  On the other hand, in the hands of a true professional, the cheapest, cheesiest magic trick can become something absolutely mind-blowing.  (Seriously.  I have a thirty-five cent commercial magic trick that I only pull out once or twice a year as a special encore piece.  The routine is seven-minutes long and is so strong that nothing can follow it.  It brings the audience to their feet.) An effect that kills for one performer may fall flat in someone else's hands.  So you're asking the wrong question.  Don't try to find a \"cool trick\".  The audience never remembers a trick, anyway... they remember the PERFORMER.   ",
