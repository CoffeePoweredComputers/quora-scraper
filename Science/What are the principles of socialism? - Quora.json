            "answer_text": "Socialism is an economic system. The theory was developed by Karl Marx in the 1800s. Marx made a number of predictions about the capitalist economic system, none of which came to fruition. He was wrong about everything. The basic premise of socialism is that the State controls the economy for the supposed benefit of the State. Socialism and freedom cannot co-exist. Because socialism undermines motivation, both to do well at the top, and to do anything at all at the bottom, socialist economies do not maximize prosperity. Because there is no economic motivation to work at all, socialist nations must motivate people through force, force of prison or death usually. Socialism is not a single economic system, but a range of systems. All communism is socialist, but not all socialism is communist. With socialism, the State owns or strongly controls the means of production and distribution. With Communism, there is no private property. There is also the anarchist socialist system, where there is no state. These are unstable by nature and will quickly evolve into capitalism or statist, because some people will simply acquire wealth or power and there is no way to stop them aside from violence, and those with more wealth and power will win. I don\u2019t recall there ever having been an anarchist socialist nation. Every economy is a mix of capitalism and socialism. Singapore has the freest economy in the world, and its government builds apartment buildings. North Korea is the least free economy, and people are trading between themselves at small scales. India is mostly socialist and mostly poor, but the IT sector is capitalist and very prosperous. India is also the only true democratic socialist nation currently. Sweden was from WWII until the early 1970s, but they were the poorest people in Western Europe and decided to transform into a capitalist nation, thereupon the became among the richest people of Western Europe. Most socialist countries maintain control by starving and murdering their citizens. ",

            "answer_text": "In a word, equality. Or rather, greater equality. Philosophically \u201ccomplete equality\u201d is such a quagmire of begged questions, contradictions and conundrums, it\u2019s not worth dwelling on. But gross inequality is enough gof an evil to justify socialism. Socialists\u2019 chief assumption is that inequality is fundamentally created by society which \u201cdisadvantages\u201d some groups so much that their chances in life are severely constricted. Poverty, like wealth, becomes hereditary. The remedy is collective action to level the playing field and give the disadvantaged a boost by tackling obstacles they face and providing them with positive support. The main criticism is that this ignores personal factors such as laziness/energy, ambition/fecklessness, intelligence/ lack of etc. Isn\u2019t at least some poverty due to personal failings and deficiencies? Socialists reply that feckless attitudes are themselves socially generated and inherited not genetically but culturally from their families. They criticise rich, successful people who think their own hard work and talent gave them success, ignoring what they owe to things provided by society such as infrastructure and education. Everyone needs society; why shouldn\u2019t it be structured to help as many people as possible? Conservatives retort that collective action (like a welfare state) fosters \u201cdependency\u201d among the poor. This is too convenient. Few people prefer not to work given decent job opportunities. Finally, it is argued that \u201creal\u201d socialism has never succeeded. Socialists retort that is has never been tried. There is ample evidence that the gross inequality doesn\u2019t work either. Capitalism relies on consumers. Not sharing the wealth around threatens to dry up markets. The bank crash haunts us. Socialism may yet grow in appeal to lay the ghost. ",
