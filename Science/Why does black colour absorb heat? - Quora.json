            "answer_text": "You actually got it the wrong way around. Objects that reflect little of the light that lands on them appear black simply because you see little reflected light. So it's not a matter of black absorbing light, but rather objects that absorb the light appear black. Now objects transfer heat in 3 main ways: conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction has nothing to do with the colour, and white metals are better at conduction than black charcoal. Convection relies on the circulation of fluids based on the concept that hotter fluids are in general less dense and hence, float above the denser, cooler fluid. Again, black tar is poorer at convection than white milk. This leaves radiation. All light that is absorbed by an object becomes heat. While objects radiate heat purely based on their temperature, their tendency to absorb or reflect light differs. Hence, objects that absorb more light appear black, and, at the same time, heat up faster. Edit: realized the question asked about heat, and not light. Edited the question to explain that. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends very much of what the black color is made of. To the eye it is not very much difference between black coal and black matte paint, but the absorbtion properties are different for invisible light such as infrared and ultra violet. The darkes object made is an object coated with of carbon nano tubes. Almost all kind of radiation is absorbed. The limit of absorbtion is its physical size. Wawelength that are longer than the extent of the object will probably work its way around the object without \u201cseeing\u201d it. Radar antennas do often have a parabolic mesh of metal wire. These parabols reflect radio waves very well toward the antenna in the middle, but pass the shorter and visible light through. That way you save lots of weight. If you emit infrared light at the wavelength of approx 900\u20131000nm towards a transparent acrylic object, or transparent glass, the material \u201cappears\u201d black to those wavelengths, and therfor absorb that kind of light rather than letting them through. Many marking equipments are lasers that print on bottles for example by emitting a text pattern on the surface. Those lasers are shielded with a transparent acrylic casing to avoid radiation to the workers in the production line. Very convenient because it will let the workers survey the laser operation without damaging their eyes. So in short: not only black absorbs heat. ",
