            "answer_text": "You know, there are many mechanisms in a large bureaucracy, which, among many other things, a church organization surely is. The Pope is in a privileged position, without a doubt. He did not appoint himself, but the College of Cardinals chose (often from among themselves) who should ascend to that ancient seat of leadership. His ministry is meant to be mostly spiritual, and in a real sense, he is not like a President, who might have more hands-on involvement in budgetary matters. The Vatican has an entire division dedicated to nothing but finance, and, as has been seen in years now, thankfully long past, can be subject to abuse, and finally attracted the previously uninvolved attention of the Pope at the time. The sheer numbers involved and the complexity of managing such an operation requires committees, management and recommendations. The Pope has, if you will, far more important things to do than run around with the Vatican checkbook spending money. His is a moral leadership, not an executive one. Checks and balances within Catholicism are held as very private matters, and some critics certainly think the higher ups should know more than it seems sometimes that they do. Others, of a more conspiratorial mindset, think they do in fact know everything and are complicit in all kinds of skullduggery. My own opinion is that any large organization attracts people who may not be identified as not true adherents to the values of the institution who nevertheless manage to glad hand their way into halls of power. Eventually these things are always discovered, and a housecleaning commences. But if you do have a phone number for the Pope and he is really handing out money, please send it to me in a private message. I have a few good ideas. ",

            "answer_text": "He has to go through finance like everyone else & he has to have a good reason for a purchase & it has to be clarified ahead of purchase. Francis is a Jesuit: that means he's taken vows of poverty, chastity & obedience. He doesn\u2019t even own the sandals on his feet. What would he spend it on? My guess is that if he had access to funds he'd likely either spend it on the poor in Rome or donate it to places of extreme poverty where the Jesuits are working like Cambodia. But that's only a guess. PS When the last two deceased Pope's died, all their worldly goods were gathered & handed back to their families: in a shoe box. Pax ",
