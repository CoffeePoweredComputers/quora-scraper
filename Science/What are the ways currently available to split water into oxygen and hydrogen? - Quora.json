            "answer_text": "1. Electrolysis Dissociation              you can split water in your own home with a simple 9-volt battery! Just hook up some wires to each terminal, stick in tap water, and watch hydrogen gas generate at the negative terminal and oxygen at the positive! (You can add some salt to the water to speed up the reaction if it\u2019s taking too long). This process of using electricity to split molecules apart is called electrolysis. 2. Metal Oxide dissociation using a metal oxide, which is a metal that has reacted and bonded with oxygen. For example, rust is a metal oxide -- the iron has reacted with the oxygen in the air.By heating up the metal oxide to temperatures over 1,000 degrees Celsius, theetal oxide can be forced to let go of the oxygen. While the metal is in this oxygen-deficient state, water is passed over it in theform of steam. In this final step, the metal grabs the oxygen from the water, leaving behind two hydrogen atoms, which form hydrogen gas. 3. Ultrasonic dissociation The resonant frequency of water is ~42.7khz. When water molecules vibrate at this frequency they tend to become unstable.a piezoelectric crystal is glued to the base of water tumblr. When stimulated by electric current the crystal will vibrate. This vibration will cause the water molecules to disassociate into hydrogen and oxygen gas. 4. Photodissociation the interaction of one or more photons with one target molecule. Photodissociation is not limited to visible light . Any photon with sufficient energy can affect the chemical bonds of a water molecule. The water-splitting reaction is catalyzed by the oxygen evolving complex of photosystem II. This protein-bound inorganic complex contains four manganese ions, plus calcium and chloride ions as cofactors. Two water molecules are complexed by the manganese cluster, which then undergoes a series of four electron removals (oxidations) to replenish the reaction center of photosystem II. At the end of this cycle, free oxygen (O 2 ) is generated. 5. Radio wave dissociation  A generator emits 14-megahertz radio waves. The waves bombard a solution of regular table salt and water .Exactly what happens next remains a mystery, but one theory posits that the sodium chloride may weaken the bonds between the strong oxygen** and hydrogen atoms in water. Radio waves break apart the bonds and liberate flammable hydrogen gas molecules. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many methods for splitting up of water, but electrolysis is the most common one. Also, naturally plants split water into Oxygen, Hydrogen ions and electrons.  Electrolysis: Electrolysis of water is the decomposition of water (H2O) into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen gas (H2) due to an electric current being passed through the water. Its two types are:-High pressure electrolysisHigh-temperature electrolysisRadiolysis: Nuclear radiation routinely breaks water bonds, in the Mponeng gold mine, South Africa, researchers found in a naturally high radiation zone, a community dominated by a newphylotype of Desulfotomaculum, feeding on primarily radiolytically produced H2.[12] Spent nuclear fuel/\"nuclear waste\" is also being looked at as a potential source of hydrogen.Photobiological water splitting: Biological hydrogen can be produced in an algae bioreactor. In the late 1990s it was discovered that if the algae are deprived of sulfur it will switch from the production of oxygen, i.e. normal photosynthesis, to the production of hydrogen. It seems that the production is now economically feasible by surpassing the 7\u201310 percent energy efficiency (the conversion of sunlight into hydrogen) barrier.[13] with a hydrogen production rate of 10-12 ml per liter culture per hour.Thermal decomposition of water: Thermal decomposition, also called thermolysis, is defined as a chemical reaction whereby a chemical substance breaks up into at least two chemical substances when heated. At elevated temperatures water molecules split into their atomic components hydrogen and oxygen. For example at 2200 \u00b0C about three percent of all H2O molecules are dissociated into various combinations of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, mostly H, H2, O, O2, and OH. Other reaction products like H2O2 or HO2 remain minor. At the very high temperature of 3000 \u00b0C more than half of the water molecules are decomposed, but at ambient temperatures only one molecule in 100 trillion dissociates by the effect of heat.Chemical production: A variety of materials react with water or acids to release hydrogen.Al + 3 H2O + NaOH \u2192 NaAl(OH)4 + 1.5 H2NaAl(OH)4 \u2192 NaOH + Al(OH)3Research is being conducted over photocatalysis,[27] the acceleration of a photoreaction in the presence of a catalyst. Its comprehension has been made possible ever since the discovery of water electrolysis by means of the titanium dioxide. Artificial photosynthesis is a research field that attempts to replicate the natural process of photosynthesis, converting sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. Recently, this has been successful in splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an artificial compound called Nafion. ",
