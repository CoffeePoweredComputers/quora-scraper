            "answer_text": "Simply because it is the definition of the boiling point. One can change the this temperature by having a reduced atmospheric pressure. Using vacuum devices, we can boil not even heating the liquid, just reducing the pressure, of course it will go faster, if you heat. ",

            "answer_text": "Because until the vapour pressure reaches at least this value it is not possible for bubbles of the vapour to exist within the liquid. They will collapse. (When a kettle starts to boil bubbles of water vapour form where it is being heated and then collapse when they reach cooler water above - this makes the noise of the kettle \u2018singing\u2019 before it boils.
