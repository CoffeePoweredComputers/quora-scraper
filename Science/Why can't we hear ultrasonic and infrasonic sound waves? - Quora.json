            "answer_text": "Consider a system which works on a limited region of energy. Below or above that energy levels this system doesn't work. Why?? Because at lower level of energy it's components doesn't able to detect change in confirmation around the system and providing no deflection or reading to the observer whereas at higher level of energy it's components gets a large amount of energy which create two cases, one is that components gets such a high energy that they become useless and second is that components works properly but detector doesn't able to read such extreme reading that makes no observation for the observer again. Similar thing happened with our ears, our ear has three \u201ccomponents\u201d namely outer ear, middle ear and inner ear. We hear any sound when it is able to pass through each component and those components work completely on that sound and providing us the information about that sound. If the sound is too low or too high, our ears are not sensitive enough to hear the sound. Ultrasound are sound waves with frequency greater than 20,000 hz. The upper frequency limit in humans (approximately 20 kHz) is due to limitations of the middle ear, which acts as a low-pass filter. Ultrasonic hearing can occur if ultrasound is fed directly into the skull bone and reaches the cochlea through bone conduction without passing through the middle ear. Humans can\u2019t also hear the ultrasound because it is more than 20,000 hertz. The waves are too small and fast for the inner ear to transmit the vibrations. 20,000 Hertz is the typical upper limit of hearing, there may be individuals who can detect some frequencies slightly above this range, but not much higher. If the sound is too low or too high, our ears. Whereas, Infrasound is low-frequency sound, is sound that is lower in frequency than 20 Hz or cycles per second, the \"normal\" limit of human hearing. Hearing becomes gradually less sensitive as frequency decreases, so for humans to perceive infrasound, the sound pressure must be sufficiently high. ",

            "answer_text": "Human being has different vital organs in our body and we hear sound only through our ears. If we look at the anatomy of human ear, we can divide into 3 parts - outer, middle and inner ear . When a sound is produced or generated, the outer ear channels sound waves that reach the ear through the ear canal to the eardrum of the middle ear. Ear canal is capable of amplifying sounds with frequencies of approximately 3000 Hz. As sound travels through the outer ear, the sound is still in the form of a pressure wave, with an alternating pattern of high and low pressure regions. It is not until the sound reaches the eardrum at the interface of the outer and the middle ear that the energy of the mechanical wave becomes converted into vibrations of the inner bone structure of the ear. The middle ear is an air-filled cavity that consists of an eardrum and three tiny, interconnected bones - the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The eardrum is a very durable and tightly stretched membrane that vibrates as the incoming pressure waves reach it. A compression forces the eardrum inward and a rarefaction forces the eardrum outward, thus vibrating the eardrum at the same frequency of the sound wave. The inner ear consists of a cochlea, the semicircular canals, and the auditory nerve. The cochlea and the semicircular canals are filled with a water-like fluid. In addition to being filled with fluid, the inner surface of the cochlea is lined with over 20 000 hair-like nerve cells that perform one of the most critical roles in our ability to hear. Each hair cell has a natural sensitivity to a particular frequency of vibration. When the frequency of the compressional wave matches the natural frequency of the nerve cell, that nerve cell will resonate with a larger amplitude of vibration. This increased vibrational amplitude induces the cell to release an electrical impulse that passes along the auditory nerve towards the brain. Because of the co ordination between outer, middle and inner ear, sound frequencies only between 20hz and 20000hz can be processed and heard by our brain. The other frequencies such as ultrasonic and infrasonic sound waves does not generate ideal vibration by all our ear parts responsible for hearing and are not able to recognize by our brain. It is just like how our eyes can see only visible lights, but cannot see other lights like ultra violet rays and infra red rays. ",
