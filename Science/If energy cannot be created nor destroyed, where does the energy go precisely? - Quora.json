            "answer_text": "The laws of conservation (energy, momentum, mass, etc) simply stated\u2026 the universe is one giant Perpetual motion machine with very little in the way of friction. In physics, a conservation law states that a particular measurable property of an isolated physical system does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include conservation of energy, conservation of linear momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and conservation of electric charge. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as mass, parity, lepton number, baryon number, strangeness, hypercharge, etc. These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all. Conservation law - on Wiki Energy is simply transformed (converted) from one form to another (sometimes it\u2019s not so simple). There are many forms of energy and many ways to measure and to express them. Kinetic energy (momentum, force, flywheels, brakes, tides, waterfalls, rivers)Potential energy (just waiting to do something different - see What is the Yellowstone supervolcano? | EarthSky.org)E = mc^2 (mass is another form of energy, and vice versa)Chemical energy (gasoline, natural gas, methane, metabolism, etc. - see What is something that stores chemical energy? )Solar energy (heat collectors and solar panels, photosynthesis, climate, weather, storms, beaches and suntans)Electromagnetic radiation (light, laser beams, radios, radar, wifi)Mechanical energy (machinery, screwdrivers, etc.)Sound energy (noise, music, voices, bird calls, bats, dolphins and whales)Heat energy (steam locomotives, furnaces, refrigerators, waste from other conversions of energy from one form to another, losses due to inefficiency in conversion, see Inefficiency Quotes at BrainyQuote )Electric potential energy (light bulbs, anything zappy, nervous systems and spinal cords - see also Chemical energy)I probably missed a few more\u2026Different Forms of Energy on http://www.solarschools.net/ (Solar Schools . net)In most cases, we can convert both ways (we haven\u2019t made much in the way of mc^2 = E, however. See also this question on Quora: What is the most efficient way of changing mechanical energy into electricity and what rate can be achieved? or this one, perhaps inviting a philosophical approach to conversion, perhaps theoretical (there is a potential for either): If energy cannot be created nor destroyed, how did the Big Bang happen?
