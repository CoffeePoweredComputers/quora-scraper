            "answer_text": "Best example on when and how this is done is the flight of an airplane. The horizontal force is needed to generate a steady air flow above and below the wing profile against the aid drag. The flow creates a difference of the pressures which results in an upward lift force that compensates the plane weight and keeps the plane from falling down. The horizontal force is generated by the plane engine(s). If there is no engine - like in a glider - the force is generated by sliding \u201cdownhill\u201d on the air with properly tilted wing, so then the lift itself has a horizontal force component that compensates the air drag. Since the drag consumes energy (that would otherwise be provided by the engines), this is at the expense of the glider potential energy - the glide moves lower and lower (in fact the pilot can refill the potential energy by using of the strong upwards streams - the chimneys - which occur above certain terrain configurations in a sunny day. That\u2019s another story). Note that this lift is not just the vertical air drag - if you stopped the glider (e.g. with a rope) from moving forwards and only let is move vertically, it would fall down much faster than it\u2019s loosing the attitude during normal glide flight.
