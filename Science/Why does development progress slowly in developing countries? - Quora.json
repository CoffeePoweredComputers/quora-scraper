            "answer_text": "Development progresses slowly because the barriers to development - growth-slowing policies and regulations - benefit powerful economic and political interests, who fight to keep those barriers in place. Dismantling those barriers to growth and development requires that political leaders be firmly committed to economic policy reform and have the power and time in office needed to carry out those reforms. That doesn't happen very often, because the opponents of reform remain powerful and are often able to regroup and undo any progress made. Most developing countries are beset by some version of what Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson call \"extractive institutions\" - laws, rules, and policies enacted to shelter established political and economic elites from competition from those outside those elites. Limited economic competition creates \"rents\" - above-market profits - for the established firms, who in turn share those rents with the political elites that protect them from competition. The problem for development is twofold: first, barriers to competition largely represent barriers to growth, because competition is the most important spur to progress; and second because the arrangement is a stable equilibrium, which no one with political power has an incentive to change. In many cases, the only opportunities for progress occur in the wake of an economic crisis, when a new government assumes power without the obligation to support the interests of the entrenched economic elites. Unfortunately, the latter often manage to worm their way back into power, and undo many of the reforms made by the previous government. The best examples of sustained and rapid economic policy reform were the four \"East Asian Tigers,\" all of which faced serious external political threats and needed to deliver growth as a way to bind the interests of their citizens to their own. All achieved very rapid growth as a result. In the absence of such a threat, most governments have the luxury of relying on the support of narrow economic elites, and thus continue to support the latter by maintaining growth-stifling barriers to competition with the firms they own and operate. As a result, breaking free of the burden of extractive institutions is usually a very slow and difficult process. ",

            "answer_text": "In the developing countries there are many many factors that cause progress to slow down. One of them is the huge gap between the rich and the poor. In a developing country the rich live like kings, the poor die of hunger. The dynamics of a developing country are favorable for such an economic imbalance. The imbalance serves rightly to those who are in power. Progress will fill the gap up rapidly. The middle class will grow. It would be common for a king to live on 10 downing street. Such a position is not suitable for the men in power with no vision. Such are the kings of the developing countries. So is the progress slow. ",
