            "answer_text": "Not in our expanding universe. Our horizon is a horizon because everything beyond it is expanding away from us at greater than the speed of light. So if something somewhere beyond, accelerated, even reaching near light speed it could never be seen by us because (from our perspective) the part of the universe this something (or someone!) is in is rushing away from us at more that the speed of light so they could never reach the horizon. Before you object that nothing can travel faster than light, this speed limit does not apply to the universe itself (for example the early inflation of the universe after the big bang occurred at much greater than light speed). We today can only see what things looked like in the past. When we look at very distant galaxies we see them as they were billions of years ago not as they are now. Intrepid astronomers in those far distant galaxies would see our milky way galaxy as it used to be before the solar system ever existed. Given aeons of time those far distant galaxies will disappear from view over the horizon and as the universe approaches heat death only our local gravitationally locked structures will be visible as the substance of the universe rushes away from us.

            "answer_text": "Could objects beyond our event horizon, that we cannot see, accelerate toward us, and come into view? Unlikely, to say the least.The problem is that if an object is beyond our event horizon then it exists in a portion of spacetime that is expanding away from us as fast; or even faster than the speed of light. (Spacetime itself is not bound by the speed of light - objects/energy within spacetime IS bound by (c))! In other words - suppose you have a spacecraft that is approaching us at (c)\u2026 (Yes, I know, 9.999999blah blah blah\u2026 but THIS one is coming at us at (c))\u2026 So there it is, streaking along like an exocet, only faster and aimed straight at the bullseye\u2026 which also just happens to be US! OMG!!!\u2026 What TF are we gonna do? This will be the end of civilization as we know it, etc.! CHILL!Take it easy! - No matter how fast the thing is heading towards us it can NEVER reach us\u2026 SPACETIME itself is pulling it away from us every bit as fast as it is travelling towards us - so, in effect it is absolutely stationary with respect to us! Have you ever had the fun of walking down an upcycling escalator?That is what happens\u2026 nothing! Problem solved!No little green men! Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "The reason that we cannot see things beyond a certain point is because at that point, the universe is expanding faster than the speed of light. So before you point out that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, the caveat is that nothing can travel through space-time (the \u201cfabric\u201d of space) faster than the speed of light. However, space-time itself can expand faster than the speed of light and also did so immediately after the \u201cBig Bang\u201d during the period referred to as inflation. So it would require an object to travel faster than the speed of light through space-time before it could come into view from beyond what you call our \u201cevent horizon\u201d. Perhaps there is some undiscovered physics that will allow such \u201cwarp\u201d speed, but if it were an alien spacecraft, it would be so tiny that we would not be able to detect it at that distance ",

Each could be expanding like ours, so those in closest proximity to ours would eventually come into view and \u201cmingle\u201d with the stuff we can see moving away. However all cosmology beyond our event horizon is speculative. ",

Problem with this Einsteinian understanding of the world is the very bizarre amalgamation of the Entity of Space with the Entity of Time.And then , wonder of wonders : this Hybrid thing getting away from us ! Einstein was wrong to decide to adopt Spacetime from Minkowski into his own Relativity. Wronger than that is for us to , first , reify this , and then : to start expanding upon its back-acceleration !! Time and space are , by the very definition and by their own nature , two absolutely differing entities [this is in case we do not deny that \u201ctime\u201d exists , as a relatively great many of fringe physicists, many of them my own friends , believe . . . . ] So to sum up : your query is \u201cby default\u201d absurd , Sir . . . . . .
