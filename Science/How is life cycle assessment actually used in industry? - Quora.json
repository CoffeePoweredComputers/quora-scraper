            "answer_text": "It depends on the industry, the company involved and sometimes even the country. In some industries (e.g. ICT) very few companies do life cycle assessments of their products. In others (e.g. biochemical industry) LCA is much more common, but even within a particular industry different companies will use LCA in a different manner.  Most companies that perform LCAs use it mainly to improve the ecological footprint of their products and/or save money by using other or less resources. In this case a LCA is often used to compare different possible production methods in order to choose the best one. But LCA can also be used to:   get a clearer picture of the main factors that are involved in producing a product.meet company CSR standardsprovide proof that a product complies with environmental or industry standards, or with government regulations.provide basic LCA information to customers and promote a product or brand as being sustainable (marketing).",
