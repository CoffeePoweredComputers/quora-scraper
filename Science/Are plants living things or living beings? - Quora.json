            "answer_text": "Anything which is composed of a cell/cells (a cell is a chemical process - mainly combustion - taking place within a membrane) is called a living thing. All plants and animals are composed of cells, so they are all 'living things'. The term 'being' - 'a living being' - is applied to human beings. We say humans are living beings, but we don't say cats or plants are living beings. It seems that the 'being' part of the phrase implies understanding/thought/speech. Plants don't have these traits.Because we can think and talk, we have given names to what we see and these terms are intended to be specific. With greater scientific knowledge we have been able to classify living things in more detail. ",

They exhibit the process of photosynthesis (a photochemical reaction during which hydrogen and water molecules get oxidised in the presence of sunlight to form carbohydrates ,oxygen ,water molecule), It exhibit different morphology, it increases in size ,it undergoes cellular division ,I may reproduce asexually/sexual , it can produce offspring for further generations just as human reproduce sexually for reproduction in race . It grows throughout lifespan it has and undergoes agening and finally dies. From these major factors we can say that it is a living organism. ",

I think of living beings as sentient. I believe animals are living beings. ",
