            "answer_text": "You can answer that if you have the proper information. Let\u2019s do that now: You should understand that although weather and climate are inexorably linked to each other - only weather is real. It\u2019s like gravity. Both weather and gravity never stop. They are reliable even though the outcomes are not always to our liking. They are REAL science and EVERYONE on earth must agree with this analysis as everyone on earth is subject to these real sciences 24/7/365. You can\u2019t change them. They are what they are. It\u2019s REALITY, not a theory or some pie-in-the-sky consensus. such as climate change. Forecasting weather (meteorology) is not reliable and thus is a science in name only, AKA fiction. Although weather conditions continually fluctuate, those anomalies are a mere blip within climate templates. Think of it this way: An oven is generally heated to 350 degrees to bake almost everything but sometimes higher/lower heat is required. If recorded, oven temperatures, when compiled over a long period of time don\u2019t reflect any major difference to the average of 350 degrees. It\u2019s the same way with air conditioning. 70F. is the standard setting in my house but sometimes it\u2019s warmer or colder depending upon a plethora of circumstances. Climate is merely a compilation of weather events in specific regions on the earth; an averaging. It is a generalized measurement and not a hard, fast rule. The \u201cseasons\u201d further fragment that generalization. Statistical data is not scientific analysis irrespective of who is in charge of gathering that data. Climate is a fairly static measurement but it can change at any time depending on - - wait for it - - - WEATHER! Weather is real - climate is perceived. This begs the question: As climate is not an actual entity, how can \u201cclimate change\u201c exist? It doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s merely an extension of the global warming scam. Run from these people. Stupidity is often contagious! ",

            "answer_text": "It is not a question of who is a denier, but who can tell the difference between the real CC and the scam and hoax of man-made CC. The climate changes without man and what he does and that there is very little when compared to nature and the sun. Most of the scientists in the world know this and know that there is little or nothing man can do to change it. So it is clear that there is CC and most agree it does happen and most agree the idea of man can do anything about it is wacky from the very beginning. ",
