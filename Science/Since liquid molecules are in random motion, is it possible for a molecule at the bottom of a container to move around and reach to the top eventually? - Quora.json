            "answer_text": "It is possible. However, assuming absence of gravity, it can move to the top only when an external force acts on it, which can be derived from Newtons first law of motion. In the presence of gravity, the magnitude of that force should be larger to overcome gravity when it has to move upward. Now this force can be set up or can exist as a result of a concentration gradient, a temperature gradient or a pressure gradient or a potential gradient in the case where the molecule has some sort of an electric charge on it. Therefore only when some gradient exists, forces act on the molecule for it to move in some effective direction, eventually to the top perhaps. ",
