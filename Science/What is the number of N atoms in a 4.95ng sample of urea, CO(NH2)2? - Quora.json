            "answer_text": "9.9(10)^13 Relative mass of Urea = 12+16+(14+1+1)2 = 60Number of moles of Urea = 4.95(10^-9)/60 = 0.0000000000825Number of N atoms in 1 mole of Urea = 6(10^23)(2) =12(10^23)Number of N atoms in sample = 0.0000000000825(12)(10^23) = 9.9(10)^13.First, find the relative molecular mass of the compound in question by adding up all the individual relative atomic masses of all the elements. These relative atomic masses can be found in the periodic table. Second, find the number of moles of the substance in the sample. 1 mole of a substance weights its relative mass in grams, i.e. 1 mole of hydrogen (Relative mass 2) weights 2g. As such, convert the sample of urea into grams by dividing by 10^9, and then dividing by the relative mass of 60. Third, find the number of N atoms in the sample. Every mole of something has around 6(10^23) units of it. Each mole of urea molecules has 6(10^23) urea molecules. As each mole of urea also has 2 N atoms, there are 12(10^23) N atoms in 1 mole of Urea Lastly, if you know the number of N atoms in each mole of urea and the number of moles of urea in the sample, the rest is simple arithmetic.
