            "answer_text": "There are several mechanisms which alter the chromosome number during mitosis in gametes. Chromosomes can fuse, so that reduces the chromosome number by 1. Chromosomes can split, increasing the chromosome number by 1. Chromosomes can duplicate (the cell mistakenly copies the entire DNA strand twice), increasing the chromosome number by 1. Basics: How can chromosome numbers change? READ THIS Each species has a characteristic number of chromosomes per individual. However, individuals within the population can have more or less than the characteristic number. The standard number of chromosomes in humans is 46. However, about 1 in 1,000 people have a Robertsonian fusion that can reduce the number of chromosomes to 44 Robertsonian translocation - Wikipedia. Usually this is not a problem. The condition of having other than the \u201ccharacteristic\u201d number of chromosomes is called \u201caneuploidy\u201d. Variation in Chromosome Number The basic fallacy is is in the Comments: \u201cMy biology teacher told us that the reason why different species can't successfully interbreed (or produce fertile offspring) is due to the chromosomal number. \u201c Chromosome number is not the deciding factor. What matters is whether the genes can be transcribed. If the genes are still transcribed, it doesn\u2019t matter how many chromosomes there are. If one chromosome is lost for humans and other diploid organisms, all that means is that the \u201cspare\u201d gene is lost. Remember, the chromosomes in diploid organisms come in pairs. Therefore losing 1 of the pair (monosomy) often does not matter. Humans are an exception; all monosomies in humans except for monosomy of the X-chromosome is fatal. Same with getting an extra chromosome. Now there are 2 \u201cspares\u201d. Actually, one is more like \u201cin the garage and never used\u201d. Sometimes, of course, trisomy (that extra chromosome to make 3) can cause problems, i.e. Down syndrome. ",

            "answer_text": "It is possible that individuals can survive with some genes transposed from one chromosome to another, and even with complete extra chromosomes, provided all the necessary genes are present and capable of proper activation.  If you consider a distant ancestor where over millions of years viable chromosome fragmentation happens but very rarely.  Each time this happens you get a lineage that has a different number of chromosomes or different arrangement of genes than the common ancestor.  Viability of offspring depends on the resulting collection of chromosomes of both parents having all the necessary genes in working order.  The number of chromosomes isn't technically the issue, but having a complete kit of working genes that determines viability. ",
