            "answer_text": "Generally speaking, for any governmental initiative to bring in non-native and non xerophytic vegetation to thrive in such an area , following conditions should be analysed first- Viability- why ? Area is already sparsely populated and stretches of it will lie along soon to be developed Delhi Mumbai Industrial corridor. This will increase connectivity. If foodgrains can be grown somewhere else at cheaper rates, why would you chalk out an entire project worth thousands of crores to bring rivers here? Unless ofcourse, rainwater harvesting is carried out on a massive scale. Infact , its proper rain water harvesting that can actually be helpful for the a successful industrial corridor as well as for the balancesd ecosystem of thar.Water availability 24*365\u2014 something like a river linking project (there would be some problems as Indian states have been fighting over river water sharing ) or a canal project (like Indira Gandhi Canal). Also, there is restriction due to Indus water treaty. We cannot use all rivers of J&K and Punjab to drain Thar. Also, Ganga \u2014 Yamuna river basin is already stressed.Bunding or some sort of native xerophytic vegetation to stop soil erosion\u2014 as wind is a powerful eroding agent. Therefore, first of all lots of thorny vegetation should be arranged first to have flowers later.Proper drainage to avoid soil getting saturated with salts \u2014 potentio-evaporation transpiration is high. As water evaporates it will keep on leaving some salts. If unchecked there will just a salt plain.Potential of such a project to generate money \u2014 self sustain itself rather than keep on requiring government funds. In short, a reliable market.Having said that, aridosols or the soil of deserts have lots of metallic ions that makes it fertile (if provided with water). And ofcourse, some part of thar has already been reformed thanks to Indira Gandhi Canal (Shri Ganganagar distict of Rajasthan). ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. See if we look from climate perspective it is impossible to develop green area through any such program. Reason:- Most of desert are situated in 20\u201330 degree latitudes of Earth and over there air subsides and on subsidence air gets compressed and this in turn causes aridity because of increasing temperature as a result of gained compression energy. So basically most of desert zones, including Thar desert, are in zone of aridity due to global wind circulation pattern, which cause higher evaporation. Here is a link for more understanding Deserts Concepts (First cause deals with the Thar desert while others are too interesting to know). Hope it helps you. Keep writing, keep reading and last but not the least keep upvoting. ",
