            "answer_text": "No, you cannot. At least, you cannot if General Relativity is true. The reason for this is that, in General Relativity, there is no universal reference frame for TIME against which you can make the judgment as to whether or not something still exists or does not exist anymore. Each reference frame has its own timeline, and the constant c, contrary to popular misunderstanding, is not the speed of light per se, it is the speed of causation, which light (among several other things) just happens to travel at. The definition of \u201cexistence\u201d is to be the cause of an effect. Thus in the reference frame of you, the observer who sees the star, the star comes into existence when its light (or gravity waves, or any of the other carriers of causation that move at the speed c) reaches you, and it ceases to exist when its light no longer reaches you. If you see the star\u2019s light, then in your reference frame, it still exists. And because there is no universal privileged reference frame, and every reference frame has its own unique timeline, it is actually nonsensical to try to talk about when objects exist or cease to exist, or when events happen, in any other reference frame but that of the observer of the event.

            "answer_text": "As long as their light is still on its way, part of it in the direction of Earth. The further we look away from Earth, the further we look back in time. That is a result of the fact that light needs time to travel a distance. More distance means further back in time. (I won\u2019t complicate things by going into the details of how it comes that for the photons no time has passed at all). You can even see stars that never existed, e.g. if someone punches you on your eyes ;-) Then there are stars you may want to sleep with (Beyonce?), but since this is not going to happen, they might as well have never existed at all.

That said we can onny see a limited distance, limited time back in history without a powerful telescope so in order to see far in the past, far into space, one needs a really really telescope. ",

            "answer_text": "All of the stars out there are far enough away so that their light takes a noticeable and easily measurable amount of time to reach us. Even light from our sun takes around 8 minutes to reach us, with the next closest star system Alpha Centori it takes 4 years for us to receive its light. From there the distances just grow and so does the time it takes the light to reach us. So to answer the question yes most probably at least some of the stars you see at night are no longer shining but we won't know until it stops, or we witness a super nova. ",

Accordingly, it could have blown any time in the last 7,500 years and we would not know about it until the light energy burst reached us. Of course, something will still remain. Exactly what is unclear, but it will not be a blue supergiant. ",
