            "answer_text": "The simple answer: no scientist (or at least no recorded scientist) has actually witnessed a star disappearing. Yet some stars do seem to vanish. The most interesting recent case is the LBV (luminous blue variable) in the dwarf galaxy PHL 293B. This is no longer visible. The mundane explanation is that it had been undergoing a long-term bright phase, and it has now sunk back into obscurity (the star is seventy-five million lightyears away). The more exciting suggestion is that it has somehow become a black hole without becoming a supernova first. This second scenario is possible, but is thought to be a rare event. More generally, scientists have asked themselves whether any stars, that they expected to be shining more or less permanently for us (stars work on much longer time scales than we do) have actually decided to disappear. The Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations (VASCO) Project spent some time comparing 70-year-old surveys with recent images. In December 2019 they announced that more than 100 stars are now, apparently not visible. These are preliminary results, so there is no actual evidence - yet- of any stars vanishing. Apart from natural causes, and of course data errors, we could speculate that aliens constructing Dyson spheres very quickly could be responsible for some of the cases (though it has been suggested that Dyson spheres should still radiate in the far infrared). The only way for a scientist actually to see a star disappearing is to have many more scientists working in this field\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Have scientists observed a star disappearing? A: In fact, yes. Several times. Here\u2019s one possible such observed example:  Normally, a dying star becomes a red giant, casts off most of its outer core and leaves a faint white dwarf behind. Sometimes, if they are massive enough, they explode spectacularly and leave a neutron star or a black hole behind. The above example could be a failed supernova, a red giant that seems to go supernova but then just disappears instead. It is thought that failed supernovae, sometimes called \u201cun-nova\u201d, are the births of black holes. As the core collapses, and the black hole\u2019s event horizon forms, a critical amount of the mass that would otherwise go kablooie in a supernova explosion ends up inside the event horizon, meaning that the supernova explosion never happens. From our perspective, it would look like the one above: poof! no star. ",

            "answer_text": "When very massive stars reach the end of their lives, a huge supernova explosion is witnessed. For about 10 years, astronomers were observing a giant star in the constellation Aquarius, about 75 million light years away. There were indications that the star would explode soon. It was classified as a \u201cblue variable star\u201d as it was unstable and showing fluctuations in brightness. So they thought it would explode one day but when astronomers tried to locate the star a couple of days ago, they did not find it. It had simply vanished. The explanation is that the star became a black hole without first becoming a supernova. There is no evidence that there was a supernova. Such an event is known as a \u2018failed supernova\u2019 a very rare occurrence. ",

There are known reasons in some cases: a star has fallen into a back hole, a star is moving and is hidden by an intervening dust cloud, or gravitational lensing can make a star appear in the wrong location. The star may reappear in some cases. There may be other things happening. The unknown is intriguing. The stars are too far away to see what happening clearly and there are just too many stars to monitor all stars at all times. We only see they were visible at one time and not when that same small areas of the sky is checked again, usually some years later. It\u2019s like a whodunnit crime scene with little or no clues. ",

            "answer_text": "well Chris, i vaguely remember a headline recently that made that claim but i did not learn any details. you might have better luck with a Wikipedia search for the subject of Disapearing Stars. Maybe NASA or your nearest University Astronomy website? be cautious with online searches. there are a lot frauds & fakirs trying to ensnare the credulous. wiki is about 99% reliable as to competent, credible real scientists. & wiki is not afraid to correct errors or shy about warning of bogus sources & known charlatans.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s interesting that many answers give evidence that stars seem to disappear. To me it makes a lot of sense because most of the stars we see aren\u2019t there anymore. Their light has been traveling to us for uo to 13 billion years and our observable universe only has 5% of the original mass which means that stars will disappear into black holes and into another energy level of the universe.

            "answer_text": "Yes. A star 75 million light-years has gone missing just this month. We are still trying to figure out why it disappeared. Normally, such a big blue supergiant goes supernova or gamma-ray burst when it runs out of its nuclear fusion fuel and fuses iron and loses the fight against gravity. But in this case, no such supernova was recorded. ",
