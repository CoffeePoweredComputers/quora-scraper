            "answer_text": "Its all over the nation going on mostly on the East Coast. Las Vegas is seeing a big upturn. Arizona proved that mask wearing works as they brought down their cases no going back up rapidly as Trump proclaims that the virus is going away we turned a corner. Sadly this is going exactly how I predicted it will go back at the end of August. I figured schools would open in September and that by mid October cases and deaths would go back up like we had in August. So the superspreader event is the whole country. I only count 8 states where the virus is not growing. Texas and California are the biggest of that group. Unfortunately for Trump, Ohio and Michigan and Florida are getting hit hard. I think this spells certain doom for him to lose the election in 2020. Now I am concerned what Trump will do as a lame duck President but I guess he does next to nothing now at the federal level so we just have to wait till January 21, 2020 for relief. Herd Immunity and delays with the vaccine? Lets start another superspreader event. ",
