            "answer_text": "The most vigorous reaction, between two elements for the formation of an ionic compound, in theory, would be between the most electronegative element and the least electronegative element, Fluorine and Francium respectively, according to the Pauling scale. So it would be 2Fr + F2 ->2FrF. But for a more practically reasonable choice, because Francium has a very short half life, would be Caesium and Fluorine because Caesium is just right above Francium, being in the same group (Group 1 / IA). 2Cs + F2 -> 2CsF. In both cases, the outermost electron of the Caesium/Francium atom will be taken by the Fluorine atom, in the process, releasing a massive amount of energy. ",

            "answer_text": "If I had to make a prediction, I would say Francium and Fluorine because they are on opposite ends of the electronegativity spectrum. Fluorine would literally rip the valence electrons away from Francium in an explosive manner to form the ionic compound FrF. Since there is barely any Francium on earth, a good second choice would be Cesium and Fluorine. For the same reasons, this would also be a spectacular reaction resulting in the formation of the ionic compound CsF. ",
