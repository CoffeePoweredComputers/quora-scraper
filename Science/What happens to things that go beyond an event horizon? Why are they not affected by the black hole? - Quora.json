            "answer_text": "The Event horizon is the boundary marking the limits of a black hole. Nothing inside the event horizon can ever cross the boundary and escape beyond it. You have probably come across the definition \"an event horizon is a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer\" and so want to know why. Normally, when we say \u201cbeyond the event horizon\u201d it means \u201cinside the event horizon\u201d because we are outside. Hence the confusion. BLACK HOLES severely distort spacetime only in their immediate vicinity. Their gravitational effect on distant objects would be like any other equally massive object. Gravity is the strongest within the event horizon, which is not a material surface - but a mathematically defined 'demarcation boundary'. Gravity is still strong outside the event horizon, so, material, such as gas, dust and other stellar debris in the vicinity of the event horizon form a flattened band of spinning matter around the event horizon called the accretion disc. Although no-one has ever actually seen a black hole or even its event horizon, this accretion disk can be seen, because the spinning particles are accelerated to tremendous speeds by the huge gravity of the black hole, releasing heat and powerful x-rays and gamma rays out into the universe as they smash into each other. However, the material loses angular momentum which allows it to get closer to the central object and eventually enter the event horizon and be lost for ever. You are aware, the amount of gravity that something possesses is proportional to its mass and distance from other objects. Therefore, for objects not be affected by the black hole, objects need to be really far away - like a thousand times the radius of the event horizon - the Schwarzchild Radius. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume that by saying \u2018beyond event horizon\u2019 you mean \u2018outside event horizon\u2019.  And its not true that things outside event horizon doesn\u2019t get affected by black hole. Event Horizon is a line which simply means that if you're inside an event horizon, there's no escape,because inside event horizon the escape velocity becomes \u201cc\u201d. You can still escape a black hole (because it will be pulling you & Spaghettificating you), if you're traveling fast enough. But inside a event horizon, you're not going home. ",
