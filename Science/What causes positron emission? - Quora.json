            "answer_text": "According to Hawkins and other theoretical considerations is our 3D-space wrapped in a 4D / 5D space. Therefor has every space-construct its counterpart of the other side of 3D-space seen from the prospect of 4D / 5D-space. Every electron is geometrical bond to its positron and vise versa. Any electron emission like in clouds of a thunderstorm is also an emission of positron, but of the other side of our 3D-space. By the time, when science learns to understand the view from a higher dimension, when the supersymmetry of all mass carrying particle is imaginable and accepted, then this question is answered. If you wonder, how to handle the 4D / 5D space, look in my page MATRIX ",
