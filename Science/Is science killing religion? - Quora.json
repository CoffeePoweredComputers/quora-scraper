            "answer_text": "Yes and no, depending on how you look at it.Science is not directly attacking religion, and in fact throughout time many historic scientists were deeply religious, and often even priests. Some relevant articles:List of Roman Catholic cleric-scientists Science in the medieval Islamic world The problem though lies in the foundational concepts of what religion and science is supposed to do. It's often quoted that \"Science explains how, religion explains why\".This is true to a point, and for a long time this allowed religion and science to happily coexist. The problem is that when science is not available, people turn to religion for answers. This is fine for some things, and I admit that religion can offer some confort for some. Unfortunately religious answers were also applied to the observable universe.   As science progresses and explains more and more of how the univese works and what \"makes it tick\", religion ans science were fated to come to a head. Now I'm pretty sure that Copernicus didn't intend to go head to head with the church.  He was just trying to solve the puzzle that the geocentric position that the church was teaching conflicted with his observations on the movement of the planets. He, like many scientists at the time, was trying to understand god's plans by understanding how he had shaped the earth and the heavens. His observation that the earth was not the centre of the universe contradicted what the church had been teaching for centuries and thus was undermining the \"infallibility\" of the church. Let's just say that the church did not respond gracefully. Ever since then, science and religion have been regularly colliding. Science is eternally building up a large body of work, checked and double-checked of observable facts, giving us a better and better understanding of the universe all the time. As a result, people don't have to trust in religion for their answers any more. As science progresses, claims of the supernatural are easily exposed as hoaxes. This has resulted in a sharp drop in the number of reported miracles in the past few centuries. In the end, religion is losing the conflict. Less and less people are concerning themselves with church. Science is providing the answers these days. Science has proven to cure more people than prayer. Various religious organisations have tried to deal with that in different ways.  Some try to provide a social function.Some try to unite their members in hate (like the Westboro Baptist Church) Others have decided to go head to head with science by promoting ignorance. In the end though, these actions are really just postponing the end result.Perhaps Religion will survive somehow. In which case I hope it will provide something positive. I doubt that it will ever have the power it had over us again though. ",

            "answer_text": "I admit i have not read all content yet. Religion is trying to grasp a new concept. They cannot do this until they accept the motivator. Then what is this to become. You are in grade 4. You stand there as the school door closes. I am psychic. I can take you anywhere you desire or even before you desire. In the end days expect the psychics (soothe Sayers) They know answers anyway. They touch and with touch they even touch minds. Your own dreams as you know already are not yours. Burn them they are witches. Yet civilization shifts into a higher and higher gear. Now you speak of defunding even entire police forces. You do not yet understand but there is something incredible about this. Wars have not been any true love loss. Drink a good cheer but respect all and every human being. The chimes ring out check the weather updates. You look at the sky, but your phone talks better ideas. Science was founded by religion. religion created by those who were keen. They knew the cliffs had view of passing animal for their own tribe and/or family. Today you call them psychic. Drop of a pin and they are alert. Does he talk to this animal we are about to hunt. You have no concept. Humans of 6 or 50 thousand years ago did not even think. Someone did. Medicine man would wake whom he wanted and make them go on the hunt. Medicine man was psychic. Let the ruler live in lavishness. You knew the truth of most things. quick fast answer. \u201cwhy is the sky blue\u201d. what is a rainbow. Explain why the watched photon does one thing, but leave it unwatched and it does it\u2019s own thing, even as if to just ignore you completely. Human observer and quantum mechanics. This is psychic but he knows he has not proof nor even a better theory. Yes the human can cause evenlight to shift and move as desired. You simply lack education of knowledge. Blindsiding science is simple. even i own a tape measure and a truly held magnify glass. explain to the psychic why ten feet away the photons of light do follow his commands. He knows this and explained this completely in grade 4 of elementary schooling. Aghast the teacher found five children with exceptional IQ. 140 IQ is nothing to a ten year old boy. Idonot want to move to grade 7. that is higher than Karen. Grade 4 AND be surrounded by friends was the delight of my early life. science. religion. then i also must exist and by existing i do set an entire precedence. Without my own views then even science could mock humanity. Must also conform to my own views of my own reality. religion is too easy as a psychic. \u201ceveryone have a good day\u201d religion complete;ly lost reality. Here on Earth and in Canada over 400 clergy languish in prison for raping their protective care children. Popes have not even properly cried. there are dead children too. hidden on sacred ground they raped but children died. I am the full psychic. I move continents to make ideas known. My ideas can overfill an entire planet. terra form remove panama and refresh the oceans from the killing stinking americans who pollute all greAt waters. You will do as isay even now or later because now humans Remark a world without a police force. The doug/guod/gawd isalive. My 2012 ideas have found reality. 2020. you have a year. i have an entire life. try to keep up. ",
