            "answer_text": "The spectrum of each element is unique because each element has a unique electronic configuration. The frequency of a scattered photon is determined by a change in the quantum energy level of the scattering electron, and the energy levels that are possible are mainly determined by the number of electrons (and protons) bound by the atomic nucleus. Thus, the spectra of an ionized atom differs from that that of the neutral atom. Incidentally, the spectra of an atom in a very strong electric or magnetic field differs from that of an atom outside of the field, again because of the permitted changes in quantum energy levels, but the deviation in frequencies from the normal spectrum are relatively small..
