            "answer_text": "Basically speaking, the left hand side of the table contains your alkali metals, which are generally the ones which are most reactive due to the small number of electrons they have in their outer shell. The middle of the table then contains your transition metals, these are what most people would identify with as metals, things like iron, copper, gold etc. They can be reactive when paired with the right elements but tend to be found in their natural state or in ore form. Just right of that is other metals or metalloids, and also the non metals, they are divided by that zig zag line through the middle. The two columns to the right of that are your halogens (quite reactive due to only having one free electron space in outer shell) and your noble gases (not at all reactive, full outer shell of electrons) respectively.
