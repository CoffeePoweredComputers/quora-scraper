If there are 100 liters in total, then how many sets of ten liters are there? (Hint: Divide.) So how many liters of milk are there? (Hint: Multiply) And how many liters of water are there? (Hint: Multiply by the same value.) You want a ratio of milk to water of three-to-one. That means that, for every one liter of water, you want three liters of milk. Given the amount of water that you already have, how many liters of milk would be equal to three times this amount? (Hint: Multiply by 3) How much milk then should be added? (Hint: Subtract.) ",
