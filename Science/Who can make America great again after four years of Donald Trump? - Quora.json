            "answer_text": "America may never be great again. Trump has done so much damage to the country, it may be beyond redemption. Sure, Biden can and will reverse many of Fat Nixon's most heinous crimes, but not everything. One thing that Biden or anybody cannot fix for that matter is the 4 out of 10 so-called Americans who behave seditiously and like unrepentant racists. They will continue to do so. Trump opened a Pandora's Box that may be impossible to close. This new breed are perpetually angry and intentionally ignorant. Everything is fake news to these psychotic conspiracy theorists. They live in an alternate reality. How can the now Divided States recover with nearly half the its population filled with anti-American haters with a grudge? They work shitty jobs for shitty pay for their billionaire masters and will do so until the day they die. Rather than take responsibility for their own poor life choices, they scapegoat everyone not white and losers like themselves. America is in decline now. All empires fall. After 244 years, it is the Divided States\u2019 time. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it is up to all Americans to make America great again. That includes Congress, our courts, the executive branch and the public as a whole. For our country to be successful we need to communicate, rethink our biases and remember our country is made up of a diverse population\u2014not just racially and politically, but also culturally. Some of our needs are different but we also have different wants (though they aren\u2019t always necessary). Let\u2019s quit pointing our fingers, trying to place blame, and talk to each other as human beings. Remember our four fathers didn\u2019t agree about everything but found what was best for all at the time. Why can\u2019t we rethink things and figure out what is best for all? ",
