            "answer_text": "Rainbows come from light rays being bent in different amounts by going through drops of water in the sky. The concept of rainbows came from eyes that register color and shape and send that information to the brain. The brain recognizes things about the colors and shapes and sends that information to memory cells. Since rainbows come with changes in the weather the brain assigns a special recognition to that memory. ",
