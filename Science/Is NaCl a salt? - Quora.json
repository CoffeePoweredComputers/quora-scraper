            "answer_text": "Yes NaCl is a salt. The general reaction is Base + Acid -> salt + water NaOH (base) + HCl (acid) -> NaCl + H2O Extra fact: not all bases and acids react to form salt and water. Only a reaction between an arrhenius acid and an arrhenius base forms salt and water. According to Lowry-Bronsted and lewis theory, when a base reacts with acid, a complex is formed. Eg. BF3 + NH3 -> BF3NH3 This complex has a co-ordinate bond. In which the lone pair on nitrogen is shared with BF3. ",

            "answer_text": "Sodium chloride is an ionic compound with the chemical formula NaCl, representing a 1:1 ratio of sodium and chloride ions. With molar masses of 22.99 and 35.45 g/mol respectively, 100 g of NaCl contains 39.34 g Na and 60.66 g Cl. Sodium chloride is the salt most responsible for the salinity of seawater and of the extracellular fluid of many multicellular organisms. In its edible form of table salt, it is commonly used as a condiment and food preservative. Large quantities of sodium chloride are used in many industrial processes, and it is a major source of sodium and chlorine compounds used as feedstocks for further chemical syntheses. A second major application of sodium chloride is de-icing of roadways in sub-freezing weather.
