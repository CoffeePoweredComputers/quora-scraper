            "answer_text": "Most of Tesla's early inventions fell into the categories of electrical power distribution  or motors and generators.  Nikola Tesla developed the polyphase alternating current system of generators, motors and transformers. Tesla did not invent the concept of AC (alternating current) power distribution. George Westinghouse was working with AC power distribution for years before meeting up with Tesla. In 1888 Tesla presented to the American Institute of Electrical Engineers his polyphase alternating current system in the report \u201cA New System of Alternating Current Motors and Transformers.\u201d  Westinghouse was impressed with Tesla's work and approached him about joining forces. Westinghouse purchased Tesla's alternating current patents on the electric systems and paid Tesla to work with him until they were fully implemented by Westinghouse. The success of Westinghouse and Tesla over Thomas Edison is known as the \"War of Currents.\" After the work for Westinghouse was completed, Tesla focused his efforts on radio and wireless transmission of electricity.   Probably Tesla's most well known invention is the Tesla Coil, a device used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. In 1899 Tesla created a lab in the mountains of Colorado Springs to experiment with high voltage - high frequency electricity where he built a huge 52 foot Tesla Coil. One of the areas where Tesla is least known, where arguably he could have been the most successful, is his work in radio. In 1898 Tesla patented a radio controlled boat which he demonstrated at Madison Square Garden, New York. As the world was proclaiming Guglielmo Marconi as the father of radio in the early 1900s, Tesla seemed unconcerned because he held several patents that Marconi was using in his creations.  At first the patents of Tesla were upheld, from 1900 to 1903 the US Patent Office rejected Marconi's patents for radio. But for reasons not clearly explained, in 1904 the US Patent Office gave Marconi a patent for the invention of radio. Tesla did not have the financial resources to fight Marconi over the patents.   <updated> I bought into the myth that the 1943 ruling by the US Supreme Court was \"proof\" that Tesla should be called the father of radio because Marconi lost the patents to radio. The argument sounds good on the surface, until you read the court ruling.  While it is true that many of Marconi's patents were overturned in The US Supreme Court Ruling of 1943, Marconi Wireless Tel. Co. v. United States, the ruling does not make any claimed to who invented radio, and the patents that were overturned of Marconi were patents that were held by Sir Oliver Lodge and John Stone Stone regarding tuning circuits. The syllabus at the beginning of the 1943 U.S. Supreme Court decision provides a summary of the ruling. There are thirteen section summaries. None mentions Tesla. You really have to dig into the decision to find references to Tesla. The primary findings of the decision was that Marconi's tuning patent was overturned, because of  John Stone Stone's and Sir Oliver Lodge's priority. </updated> Learn more: Who Invented Radio? from the PBS series on Tesla:Master of Lightning: Who Invented Radio?

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A !!! It is true that there has been a great rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Elva Edison. Edison has stolen many of Tesla\u2019s work and make them patent on his own . But Light bulb is not one of them. Even Tesla has no major role in invention of light bulb. Note down this timeline of light bulb In 1841, Frederick de Moleyns of England was granted the first patent for an incandescent lamp, with a design using platinum wires contained within a vacuum bulb. He also used carbon.In 1845, American John W. Starr acquired a patent for his incandescent light bulb involving the use of carbon filaments. He died shortly after obtaining the patent, and his invention was never produced commercially.In 1851, Jean Eug\u00e8ne Robert-Houdin publicly demonstrated incandescent light bulbs on his estate in Blois, France. His light bulbs are on display in the museum of the Ch\u00e2teau de BloisIn 1872, Russian Alexander Lodygin invented an incandescent light bulb and obtained a Russian patent in 1874. He used as a burner two carbon rods of diminished section in a glass receiver, hermetically sealed, and filled with nitrogen, electrically arranged so that the current could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been consumed.Finally, on 24 July 1874, a Canadian patent was filed by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans for a lamp consisting of carbon rods mounted in a nitrogen-filled glass cylinder. They were unsuccessful at commercializing their lamp, and sold rights to their patent (U.S. Patent 0,181,613) to Thomas Edison in 1879.As Thomas bought patent of light bulb thus he was accredited for invention of light bulb. It was Edison who market light bulb to citizens who were feared even with use of light. Tesla role was only involved in advisong Richard Dean Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable to light bulbs. ",
