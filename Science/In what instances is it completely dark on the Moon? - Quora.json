            "answer_text": "In the circumstance that one is inside a subterranean lunar cave. The moon\u2019s nights and days cycle as the exactly as ours do, as it revolves in the sun\u2019s light. But where we revolve once per day, the moon revolves once every 28 days, always presenting the same face to Earth as it goes around us in its orbit. The the moon has two week days and two week nights, but it\u2019s never quite dark. When the Earth-facing side is in darkness, it\u2019s illuminated by earthshine, just as our nights are illuminated by moonlight. And when the space-facing side is in darkness, it\u2019s still illuminated by starlight, which while dim, is a good bit brighter than here on Earth. Those who have lived their whole lives in cities or at low altitude cannot fully grasp what that is like. I was fortunate enough to grow up in South Dakota, in a family fond of adventure. I have seen the stars from the badlands there, through cool dry air, 150 miles from the nearest town, where the stars in the core of our galaxy form a luminous haze the reaches out to cradle us. I imagine the same sight, from the darkened far side of the lunar night, it nothing short of spectacular. ",

            "answer_text": "In the way that on Earth we have a day and night every 24 hours it is similar on the Moon but it takes place over a month (the orbit of the Moon around Earth). It makes no difference if you were on the near side or far side. However you would still be able to see light from the Earth, planets and stars even if it was night on the moon. So for example if it was a new moon and you were on the near side, you would not see sunlight but you would see a very bright 'full' earth. If you were on the far side during a full moon, as seen from earth, you would be hidden from the sun but would still see the other stars and planets in clear detail without an atmosphere or light pollution to see through.
