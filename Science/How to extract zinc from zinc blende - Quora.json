            "answer_text": "First roast it when exposed to air, zinc blende react with the oxygen in the air to form sulfur dioxide and zinc oxide 2ZnS + 3O2 \u2192 2ZnO + 2SO2, when the roasting is complete, roast it with coal, the coal will react with zinc oxide when the temperature reaches hot enough 2ZnO + C \u2192 CO2 + Zn Hopes this helps:)  Note that the process is for iron but it is the same with zinc:) ",
