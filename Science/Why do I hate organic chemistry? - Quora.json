            "answer_text": "A lot of my colleagues shared the same feeling,back when we were in the 12th grade.Like most subjects in India,Organic Chemistry is also taught via rote.The student is never taught that there is harmony in the reaction processes & the process of synthesis of various molecules.Thus,its only natural that one finds it 'hateful' or boring.Plus,the added pressure of scoring high marks & cracking the competitive exams,makes things worse. Personally,I just love Organic Chemistry.Everything around you,is more or less,a manifestation of Organic Chemistry..especially,the biological processes(which includes much of what happens in your & my body) Molecules are formed,broken,synthesized for different processes & uses.Life is not possible without Organic Chemistry.The great part is,there is a method to all this madness.There are nucleophiles,electrophiles,big molecules,small molecules,transition states,organic groups,properties that run through all the endless reactions.What you need is a desire to understand(I am assuming you like knowing about Nature,since you like Physics) & a good starting point.I was lucky to have come across a fabulous book written by Robert Thornton Morrison & Robert Neilson Boyd,called 'Organic Chemistry'.The language is very simple & its written from the very basics of Organic Chemistry.Just start from Page 1,relax & the ideas will start to flow.You will be able to make head & tail of the various reactions & hopefully,start to like the subject as much as you like the others.The great part is,the book is readily available at Book stores & sites like Amazon,Flipkart.Its not too expensive either,and is worth every penny and more.Do give it a shot!

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t hate organic chemistry but all of my classmates hate organic chemistry. They hate the course maybe because of the numerous reactions and concepts that must be learned in a short amount of time. That is quite overwhelming. Like them, I also get overwhelmed. However, my fascination with reaction mechanisms made me love organic chemistry. It even gets to a point where instead of reviewing for my exams in other subjects, I watch organic chemistry videos. That is why when I review for organic chemistry the day before the exam, it\u2019s easier for me to absorb the information that I need for the exam. ",
