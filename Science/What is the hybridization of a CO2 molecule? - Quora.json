            "answer_text": "According to VSEPR theory, we can use the steric number (SN) to determine the hybridization of an atom. SN = number of lone pairs + number of atoms directly attached to the atom. SN = 2 corresponds to sp hybridization.SN=3 corresponds to sp2 hybridization.We see that the C atom has SN = 2. It has no lone pairs, but it is attached to two other atoms.It has sp hybridization. Each O atom has SN = 3 . It has 2 lone pairs and is attached to 1C atom. Just as the carbon atom hybridized to form the best bonds, so do the oxygen atoms. The valence electron configuration of O is [He]2s22p4. To accommodate the two lone pairs and the bonding pair, it will also form three equivalent sp2 hybrid orbitals.  Two of the sp2 orbitals contain lone pairs, while the remaining sp2 orbital and the unhybridized p orbital have one electron each. We can see this arrangement in the C=O bond of formaldehyde, which is equivalent to the right-hand side of the O=C=O molecule.  Hence the hybridization of CO2 is sp2 hybridization. ",

            "answer_text": "CO 2 is a linear triatomic molecule. Each C = O bond is polar because O more electronegative than C, so O is the partial negative end of the bond dipole. The Lewis structure of CO2 is  The double bond behaves just like a single bond for purposes of predicting molecular shape.This compound has two groups of electrons around the carbon. According to VSEPR theory, the two sets of electrons will orient themselves 180o apart, on opposite sides of the carbon atom, minimizing electron repulsion. Therefore the molecular structure of CO2 is linear.  Double and triple bonds involve more electron pairs than single bonds, but this has little effect on the overall molecular shape. All of the electron pairs in a multiple bond are shared between the same two nuclei and therefore occupy the same region of space. All electron pairs in a multiple bond count as one bond and contribute to molecular geometry the same as a single bond does. The carbon atom in CO2 has no lone pairs and participates in two double bonds. Each double bond counts as one for the purpose of predicting geometry so the structure of CO2 is linear ",
