            "answer_text": "This depends on many things given human trade routes, technology that can be adapted to renewables, the level of waste and the level of demand. The current thinking is that we are now in a period of energy descent, the descent being one way, and down. I think by the second half of the century we will be making use of 10% or less of the current supply of fossil fuels for burning. We also need those fuels for plastics, drugs and other things. You are asking what would happen if this all occurred tomorrow, down to 0%. We know what happened to Cuba when half of its oil, pesticides, gasoline and fertiliser disappeared in two weeks after the collapse of Communism. That was in 1992. Basically everyone dropped everything and one in five people (on average) starting growing organic food full time. But they got it all together and there was no (lethal) famine. We currently rely critically on diesel, fertiliser and pesticides from fossil fuels. Before we could look at getting replacement generation sources for electricity and heat we would need to get food. We would also have no running water and no way to get rid of human waste in the city. Forget meat and dairy - most of our protein - without refrigeration. Within two weeks there would be a huge emergency. Our existing trading routes would need to save us - if our trade partners could reach us and could help. There\u2019s really nothing like fossil fuels - they are gold. We will never get easily accessible, cheap, high quality, reliable, high energy fuels again. We have burned them all. So it is probably better to think in terms of a low energy future. Perhaps they might get up fusion energy or thorium reactors or whatever, but these are not easily accessible, not cheap and not reliable. They depend on hugely complex machinery that all has to work just right and be heavily maintained. Coal you can pick up and burn. It\u2019s gone! ",

            "answer_text": "The amount of death, diseases, and human disaster would be huge. Imagine at least 50 years without cars, trucks, semi-trucks, motorcycles, ambulances, airplanes, cargo ships, firetrucks, no fertilizers, no energy, no possibility to Heat Ventilation in winter, no A.C. on summer.  This is the energy consumption by energy source in USA 2018, as you can see, the 3 main sources are Fossil Fuels, about 80%: 36.1+31.0+13.2 = 80.3 Quads Being realistic the only source of energy capable to supply these enormous amounts of energy required is Nuclear, however in the USA, due to regulation and political issues, it takes about 10 years to finish a nuclear power plant, in France is about 5 years. The USA has almost 100 nuclear power plants to supply around 8% of their energy, so they should build around 700 nuclear plants to provide around 70%. The USA has 60,000 wind turbines to supply 2.5% of energy, so to jump to 25% they have to erect 600,000 wind turbines. The USA has 1.5 million solar panels to supply 1%, so they should build 15 million to jump from 1% to 10% The other concern is energy storage because there are many times in the year that there is no sun (every night), less sun (every winter), and no wind or excess (nobody can predict exactly), so alongside with more solar panels and wind turbines they have to build an enormous infrastructure of energy storage systems, some analyst estimates that the total cost of energy storage just to convert California to renewables (without Nuclear) could cost around 3.6 \u201cTrillion\u201d dollars.
