            "answer_text": "Basically all neutron stars become pulsars. Pulsars occur because extreme forces produced by the neutron star cause matter to be accelerated at extreme velocities from the neutron star\u2019s magnetic poles (which may not be aligned with the star\u2019s rotational poles). Neutron stars gradually lose energy from this process, and eventually slow down to the point where they cease to be pulsars. Neutron stars can also be \u201crecharged\u201d by matter falling onto the star from a binary partner, causing them to spin up again. Whether or not we can see a pulsar as a pulsar from earth depends on whether or not one of its accelerated jets of matter happens to point towards earth. ",

            "answer_text": "All neutron stars start out as rotating bodies, and will produce high-speed jets. Those will interact with the stars\u2019 magnetic fields to produce radio-frequency emissions. The classic analogy is that of a lighthouse beacon. If that beacon sweeps past us, we can detect it, then from our viewpoint, the neutron star is a pulsar. The mechanism that produces the radio-frequency emissions deplete the neutron star\u2019s rotational energy, and eventually, the rotation will stop. At that point, no observer would detect a pulsar. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know how long that takes. ",
