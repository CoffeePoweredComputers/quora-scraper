            "answer_text": "The \u201cbook\u201d answer is the \u201coocyte\u201d, but muscles are individual cells, they tell us, and the biggest muscle is the Gluteus Maximus. That said, don\u2019t ask me to defend it. I learned it in a Human Physiology course that came too fast to think about it, and was one of many confusing facts I learned. \u201cA muscle cell, known technically as a myocyte, is a specialized animal cell which can shorten its length using a series of motor proteins specially arranged within the cell\u2026\u201d Muscle Cell (Myocyte): Definition, Function, Structure | Biology Dictionary That a muscle is a cell is significant, because cells wear out, and are replaced in mitosis, on schedules, depending on how fast they wear-out. Stomach lining cells go first, as they are bathed in acid that would dissolve nails. They have to be replaced every two days or less. Muscle cells, or muscles, may be too big to go thru mitosis, yet they have many nuclei. If they don\u2019t go thru mitosis, they can\u2019t mutate and become cancerous. I question how muscle cells repair themselves, if destroyed by some trauma. Muscle cancers do occur, but very rarely and they are mostly benign. Some cancers begin in the actual muscle tissue, sarcomas; the rest, I understand, start in epithelial, or \u201clining\u201d cells: \u201ccarcinomas\u201d. Children suffer most muscle tumors, they say, because their muscle cells are still dividing, \u201cduring the growth phase of the young\u201c. Adult muscle cells don\u2019t divide, except under special circumstances, one interesting example was, when using \u201csteroids\u201d. Sorry to make this answer seem \u201coff topic\u201d, but if you read this far, I \u2019m sure you found it as interesting as I did. One thing to understand is that our knowledge is far from total, and you can count on today\u2019s dogma becoming obsolete, and usually, it will disappear with no fanfare. ",

            "answer_text": "What is the largest cell in the human body?  The largest cell per diameter in the human body is the oocyte; The cell of the human ovule (also known as an ovule). The reason why I mention the diameter is that there are some neurons in our body that can be up to a meter long, those that go from the spinal cord and extend to our feet. However, the ovule has a diameter of 1000 micrometers, which is visible to the naked eye. The oocyte is released during the female menstrual cycle during a process called ovulation when a mature follicle breaks and releases the oocyte into the fallopian tube, where it moves through hairs called cilia. If the egg is fertilized with a sperm, it will be implanted in the uterine wall. If not, it will dissolve. The oocyte is so large because it contributes more material to the developing zygote. Almost all mitochondrial DNA comes from the oocyte. Mitochondria are structures within the cell that produce the energy that the cell needs to function; As a result, many mitochondrial diseases are transmitted through the mother. I would like to make a brief note about research with human stem cells and where the stem cells are collected. Stem cells are taken from a fertilized embryo 5 to 6 days old, called a blastocyst. At this stage, the embryo has between 50 and 100 large cells. The reason why these cells are so valuable is that they are pluripotent; which means that they have not yet differentiated into the different organ systems that make up a fetus. These cells can become anything, and therefore have great potential in health research. ",
