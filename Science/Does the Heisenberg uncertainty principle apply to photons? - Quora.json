            "answer_text": "The Uncertainty Principle applies to everything.  There is some uncertainty in the positions of various parts of the measuring device.  Since the photon's position is only determined where it is measured, it is not possible to determine its position with zero error.  Also photons are extended particles, and this relates to the Uncertainty Principle.  Consequently, it is impossible to say exactly where the photon was when detected, as one would imagine if it were a point particle and if one could ignore the uncertainty of the location of the measurement itself. However, while these uncertainties can never be zero, they tend to be extremely small most of the time. ",

            "answer_text": "The uncertainly principle applies to any continuous variable such as position, momentum, time and energy. If you know the photon's frequency as you have stated, you automatically know its energy [math]h\\nu[/math] thus you cannot know the time of arrival [math]t[/math] precisely and [math]ct[/math] is not an exact predictor of how far the photon has traveled. Usually photons are emitted from an energy band of a non-zero width thus their energy and thus frequency are already uncertain in a way that if you ignore uncertainty but know the \"inaccuracy\", Heisenberg's uncertainty is already included. In your experiment the photomultiplier aperture is usually larger than the position uncertainties involved thus it is only the position along the photon's path where you'll encounter the timing of arrival uncertainty, leading to the calculated position uncertainty. Just to emphasize the generality of uncertainty, when high-energy photons are used in a way that greatly reduces timing uncertainty there is even a speed-of-light uncertainty. Yes, even [math]c[/math] varies above and below the nominal speed of light, maintaining uncertainty. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, the uncertainty principle is in no way dependent on measurement techniques, it is inherent in the wave nature of everything. Nevertheless, people have tried to disprove the principle by describing measurement techniques with no error. Perhaps the most famous is the one Einstein proposed at the 6th Solvay Conference in 1930. Bohr\u2013Einstein debates Einstein proposed a measuring device with no error. This bothered Niels Bohr who tried mightily to find the flaw in Einstein's thought experiment with, at first, no luck. Only the next day did he find the error. Einstein had failed to take into account his equivalency principle from General Relativity.He was hoisted by his own petard. In your case, it is not so hard to find the flaw. First, you haven't told us how to design a photo multiplier than is sensitive to a single, exact frequency. If you can't determine the frequency/wavelength exactly, then even assuming an exact velocity, you can't determine the momentum exactly and Heisenberg is preserved. I will leave it to you to figure out why it can't be done. Supposing you could design such a photomultiplier,  you would then have to be able to make it arbitrarily small to know the photons position without error. God luck with that as well. ",

            "answer_text": "A standard way of describing the uncertainty principle is to suppose a particle to be moving along with some velocity v, and we are observing it through a scope at some time t. But to observe it we need to see its image transmitted to us by a photon of light of wavelength l. The greatest possible precision in position is accurate only to part of the wavelength of the light we bounce off it. Never any better. And the momentum of the particle is altered by the incident photon, so the photon which reports to us has been altered in direction and precise position to the tune of the wavelength of the particle. It is not possible to detect the position of a photon without bouncing it, in some way, off a mass particle, thus changing its position, and momentum. ",

            "answer_text": "In quantum mechanics, position and momentum are \u201cconjugate variables\u201d that cannot both be certain. In quantum optics, phase and photon number are conjugate variables. If you have a Fock state (a state with a known number of photons), the phase of the wave is completely uncertain. If you have a coherent state (state with known phase) the number of photons is completely uncertain. You can have intermediate states where each of these variables is somewhat uncertain. For this reason, you would never try to describe coherent states like radio waves in terms of their photons. ",
