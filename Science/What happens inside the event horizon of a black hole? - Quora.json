            "answer_text": "Here is the thing, we don't know.  But we can extrapolate using the no drama premis of relativity.   For a normal size black hole, you won't even survive getting close.   What ever remains of you that enters will reach the singularity at the center in well under a millisecond.    For a gigantic black hole, if the ambient radiation and magnetic fields don't kill you, you might actually have more than a half an hour to observe your surroundings. The movie Interstellar gives a fairly realistic view of what you might see as you fall into the black hole.   For a person falling into the black hole, the event horizon does not exist.  It has no more meaning than say the international date line.   It is just something marked on a map, not something they can see out the window.   So nothing appears to change as you cross.   All the changes one experience are gradual. Space becomes curved, so to you it looks like the universe is becoming curved.   Since you are free falling, to you it looks like the universe is accellerating away from you, and most likely rotating as well.   Everything quickly accellerates away from you, and practically hits the speed of light.  In fact some objects you would calculate are already receeding away from you faster than the speed of light, but you are still seeing light from the past before that happened.   As such the sky becomes redshifted, eventually goes to microwave, radio, and black.  As this happens, you see the universe has been effectively frozen in time from the accelleration and velocity.  You and your crew are the last living creatures actually experiencing time. Space has become folding with time.   No matter what path you choice you are heading towards the singularity.   To you it appears like a bending of light in a fun-house of bent mirrors.   But it is all real.   You would need a third eye to actually figure out where things really are, as you see multiple images of everything in different directions.  binocular vision just does not cut it anymore. All of these are of course extrapolations.   To an external observer you appear frozen right near the event horizon flattening out, and actually burning with heat, but like everything else, the flames are frozen.   Eventually you disappear completely, redshifted from view.   Some say only the external viewers view point is valid.  You are simply dead.   We can never prove otherwise, as anyone who goes in to follow you meets the same ultimate fate, never to return.   However, those we thought were dead, with sufficient fuel can turn around and fly back out from the black hole before crossing the event horizon.   The could come back out million, billions, trillions, or even more years after we thought they were lost.   When questioned, they would all say the same thing.  They decided to turn back at the last minute and were not gone for long...    The external observer on the other hand could choice to go in and join up with someone they already have seen fly in.   The thing is they are going to need a lot of initial velocity or accelleration to catch-up.   If they do catch-up the person on the inside will say the same story.   You appeared to be frozen in time, and then started flying right at me.   Consistently the person in the black hole first will have experienced more time pass than the second.   If they are twins, the twin that went in first is older than the twin that went in second.   Since the twin that went in first only has a short time to live, that means if the twin outside waits to long, no matter how fast they are they won't be able to catchup before the first twin meets up with the singularity.   The only possibility for the two twins to meet up at the same age is if second twin flies, and the first twin attempts to fly out so both are are experiencing accelerations that further distort time.

            "answer_text": "Black-holes are singularities and space-time's curvature around them is . Anything that goes beyond a black-hole's event horizon, can never get back to the space-time. It is outside the space and it is outside the time. This means that time does not exist beyond a black-hole's event horizon. Objects fallen into a black-hole will never know what happened to them because they simply seize existing both in space and time. And as someone who is standing the other side of the event horizon, we see that they will always remain in that state and will never come back. The question is, do that objects stop existing or they continue existing outside the space-time, for example in another dimension or another universe and how can we know that? even when we know that no information from them will ever reach us. But \"is the information of the objects fallen into a black-hole lost\"?It has a nice story. This was called black hole information paradox. Let's read it from Thorne\u2013Hawking\u2013Preskill bet - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.  The Thorne\u2013Hawking\u2013Preskill bet was a public bet on the outcome of the black hole information paradox made in 1997 by physics theorists Kip Thorne and Stephen Hawking on the one side, and John Preskill on the other. Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate, and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking radiation must be \"new\", and must not originate from inside the black hole event horizon. Since this contradicted the idea under quantum mechanics of micro-causality, quantum mechanics would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the view of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way. The winning side of the bet would receive an encyclopedia of their choice.[1] In 2004, Hawking announced that he was conceding the bet, and that he now believed that black hole horizons should fluctuate and leak information, in doing so providing Preskill with a copy of Total Baseball, The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia.[2] Comparing the useless information obtainable from a black hole to \"burning an encyclopedia\", Hawking later joked, \"I gave John an encyclopedia of baseball, but maybe I should just have given him the ashes.\"[3] Thorne, however, remained unconvinced of Hawking's proof and declined to contribute to the award.[4] As of 2008, Hawking's argument that he has solved the paradox has not yet been accepted by the community, and a consensus has not yet been reached that Hawking has provided a strong enough argument that this is in fact what happens. Hawking had earlier speculated that the singularity at the center of a black hole could form a bridge to a \"baby universe\", into which the lost information could pass; such theories have been very popular in science fiction. But according to Hawking's new idea, presented at the 17th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation, on 21 July 2004 in Dublin, black holes eventually transmit, in a garbled form, information about all matter they swallow. And to sum it up. The information of the objects fallen into a black-hole is not lost. So theoretically, it can be retrieved.Hawking had earlier speculated that the singularity at the center of a black hole could form a bridge to a \"baby universe\", into which the lost information could pass.So, if we could survive the rough conditions of reaching a black-hole (extremely high tidal forces and spaghettification, extremely high temperatures), we may be able to go to another life, live and grow old, come back to our universe in any time we want as the same young man that went in, no time spent for him, and he doesn't remember anything about the other lives he had. This could be the elixir of life you could have lived thousands of years while your body was always 20-40! This means you can be imortal unless you catch a disease or have an accident or be killed. And it will be much like reincarnation and the mythical Phoenix.Would make a good Sci-Fi scenario.Bests. ",
