            "answer_text": "Of order [math]10^{80}[/math] protons, neutrons and electrons in our observable universe. These are the most important constituents, along with neutrinos\u2014their total number is about a billion times larger, but they have very low masses; less than 1 electron-Volt, whereas the proton is nearly a billion electron-Volts. There are many others, e.g. heavy electrons (muons) but those are the key ones in the present universe. Of course each proton and each neutron is actually composed of 3 quarks (up and down type). If there actually is dark matter the number of particles could be closer to the number of neutrinos (if axions) or less than the number of protons (if WIMPs). ",

            "answer_text": "This could be interpreted 2 different ways, or possibly 3: how many different elements are there?how many actual particles are there?how many different subatomic particles are there?As for the third question, there are 6 \u201cleptons\u201d: the electrons and its two more massive versions, and the neutrino and its two more massive version, and 6 \u201cquarks\u201d, the up and the down and their more massive versions. As far as as many different elements, probably \u2019bout 200, but the vast majority are ridiculously unstable, like picoseconds. As far as how many particles, practically infinite. There are on the order of 60230000000000000000000 particles in a gram of water. ",
