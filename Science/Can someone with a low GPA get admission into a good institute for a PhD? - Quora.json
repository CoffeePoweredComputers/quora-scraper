            "answer_text": "Can someone with a low GPA get admission into a good institute for a PhD? In the US? It will often or usually be a problem. The way it often works is that your research experience, statement of purpose, and letters of recommendation strongly count in the department that you apply to. But the graduate school has expectations for GPA, GRE, and TOEFL (for international students). And the dean of the graduate school has to approve all new graduate students. So if the rest of your application package is excellent, but you have a lousy GPA, then the department chair, graduate director, and your potential advisor will need to convince the dean to admit you. When I was a director, I was successful in convincing the dean to \u201ctake a chance\u201d on a grad students who had a problem in their application packages, and it worked out fine. So it is possible, and of course depends on how much credibility the department has with the dean. ",

            "answer_text": "Conceivably, yes, though you will have better chances in Europe than in the US. What you need to do is go for a Master\u2019s first, at the most prestigious university you can get into, and then get the best grades you can get. I would even say go for a second Master\u2019s at a more distinguished place or in a more distinguished topic if the first one doesn\u2019t lift you up enough for a PhD. ",
