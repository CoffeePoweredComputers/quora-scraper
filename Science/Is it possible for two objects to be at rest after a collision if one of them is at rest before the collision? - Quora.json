            "answer_text": "I keep re-reading this question to better understand it. Assuming that M1 and M2 are equal or close to equal in mass: M1 and M2 would need to be different densities through out. Maybe like an M&M where the candy coating is tougher than the middle. (Both would need the harder exterior) The speed at which they collided would have to be fairly slow. (Slower than gravity would allow) And then, they would \u201cbounce\u201d off each other with such little energy that they only get so far apart before gravity gets a complete hold and keeps them in a stable orbit around each other. So therefore, no, neither could ever be at rest, especially since there was a collision to begin with. If M1 were substantially larger than M2, then M2 would need to be structurally superior than M1 even with its lower mass. And then, both would end up in orbit around each other even though it would appear that M1 was at rest. (nothing is truly ever at rest) So no, you couldn\u2019t get just one mass to be at rest and you\u2019d have an even harder time to get both to be at rest. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but that momentum and energy needs to go somewhere. So imagine a wall struck by a car. The car and wall take damage but the wall and car are stopped. The reason is because the wall transfers the momentum to the air behind it and the ground it is on. As well, the sound and heat of the collision causes the energy to dissipate. It isn't destroyed, but changed to a less usable form (we call this entropy.) ",

This is not possible. Mathematically:  cannot be true if p is non-zero. Lots of wrong answers to this one. ",

            "answer_text": "atoms do this with photons. because the photon is a small packet of energy with 0 mass, it can travel infinitly faster then something at rest but still create momentum when the energy is absorbed. this is the principle behind solar sails. if absorbtion and emmission of the photon releases any particle that has a mass such as an electron, then this translates to motion. but if if only absorbs and transmits a photon then no momentum is gained or lost and it doesnt move despite lightspeed photon hitting it. m would have to be infinite and 0 respectively for this to work so only massless things ide imaging would work like this.

Whether that something is the same thing depends on the collision. ",
