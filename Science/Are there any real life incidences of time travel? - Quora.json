            "answer_text": "Modern man at 1941 bridge opening A photograph from 1941 of genuine authenticity of the re-opening of the South Fork Bridge in Gold Bridge, British Columbia, was alleged to show a time traveler. It was claimed that his clothing and sunglasses were modern and not of the styles worn in Their Past Lives Here, produced and hosted through investment by the Virtual Museum of Canada. Further research suggests that the modern appearance of the man may not have been so modern. The style of sunglasses first appeared in the 1920s. On first glance the man is taken by many to be wearing a modern printed T-shirt, but on closer inspection it seems to be a sweater with a sewn-on emblem, the kind of clothing often worn by sports teams of the period. The shirt is very similar to the one that was used by the Montreal Maroons, an ice hockey team from that era. The remainder of his clothing would appear to have been available at the time, though his clothes are far more casual than those worn by the other individuals in the photograph. Man met the older himself and recorded itA video uploaded in 2006 shows a Swedish man named H\u00e5kan Nordkvist claiming that he had been accidentally transported to 2046 when attempting to fix the sink in his kitchen. There in the future he immediately met who revealed and proved to be himself about 70 years old, and with whom he \"had a great time\". He filmed a short footage of the two smiling and hugging each other and showing the tattoo they had in their right arm. The story was reportedly a marketing campaign promoting the pension plans of the insurance company AMF.  VonHelton Known simply as VonHelton, this enigmatic figure suggests he might be part vampire, but asserts he is 100% time traveler. He has provided proof of his time travel prowess by lining up side-by-side photographs of himself starting in a studio in 1857 England, with stops in 1916 France, 1945 Berlin, and ending in the modern day in front of an American flag. Is he, in fact, a time traveler? Or is his \"vampire gene\" keeping him immortal? Andrew Carlssin He traveled here from the year 2256 and then quickly amassed a fortune on Wall Street. Unfortunately, he was caught and arrested for suspected insider trading. As reported, Carlssin started with an initial investment of $800 and ended with over $350,000,000, which drew the attention of the SEC. Maybe this means that the theory of time travel that supports the idea that you CAN change time, is the right one. John Titor - A time traveller from 2036 (born in 2011)Between 2000 and 2001, an online bulletin board user self-identified as John Titor became popular as he claimed to be a time traveler from 2036 in a military mission. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct and consequently every time travel paradox as impossible, he stated that many events which occurred up to his time would indeed occur in this timeline. These included a devastating civil war in the US in 2008 followed by a short nuclear World War III in 2015. In the years following his last posts and disappearance in 2001, the non-fulfilment of his specific predictions made his popularity decrease. Criticism has pointed out flaws in Titor's stories and investigations suggested his character may be a hoax and a creation of two siblings from Florida. To date, the story has been retold on numerous web sites, in a book, in the Japanese visual novel/anime Steins;Gate, and in a play. He may also have been discussed occasionally on the radio show Coast to Coast AM.[3] In this respect, the Titor story may be unique in terms of broad appeal from an originally limited medium, an Internet discussion board. Charlie Chaplin Time Traveler A woman filmed outside the 1928 premiere of Charlie Chaplin's The Circus has convinced many people that time travel is real. The unidentified woman holds her hand up to her ear and talks to somebody, although no one is near her. But wait there were no cell phones in 1928! Could this woman be a time traveler communicating with her contemporaries via mobile phone? Strange.. ",

            "answer_text": "The order has now been modified with better recollection\u2026 For the now-electronically-available methods of magical time-travel, see: Principal Method of Time Travel: 84 Related Methods by Nathan Coppedge APPENDIX II, from a book I've written accounting of my time travel experiences, but mostly including a variety of techniques --- one section has 21 to 84 methods by itself, depending on how you look at it, they are related in sets of four. But that's a different section. This is just the appendix II (link to the book below). Dates I've Traveled To: (Sorted appropriately by earliness of the date traveled to, and secondly, order of time-travel events). #5: The Cape Scott Case [12/2005 2nd timeline] - Date of Cape Scott photo (1917?) -Observations: On this date I was visited by Jesus playing the role of a movie producer. I was briefly on the set of some kind of movie. I was asked if I wanted a particular costume, and gave details. Jesus then instructed me to hold onto a particular decorated stick for as long as I could. When I let go, the light became more intense, and I found myself in the awkward position of leaning onto somebody\u2019s lap. I turned around briefly, and saw it was a man with old-fashioned whiskers. I then knew I had traveled significantly far back in time. I looked around, and to my pleasure I saw that everyone in the scene was wearing old-fashioned clothes. We were on a hill. And then, I noticed that my physical features had been somewhat distorted from time-travel. My arms and hands were somewhat more gangly and monstrous-looking, and I could feel my face was not exactly the saeme. In my mind, Jessus asked me if I wanted to stay for the photo-shoot, and I said that I did. The camera flashed, and then I found myself once again in the year 2005. General Importance / Ticket: This scene was evidently arranged by Jesus to provide evidence of time-travelers. #7: The Car: [2013?] - 1972 - Observations: Clothes were faded colors. People were more introverted. People seemed to know that I had time-traveled. Dialogue: Excuse me, I don\u2019t mean to be rude. What year is this? 1972. Impressed? You know he was high! You stumpin\u2019? You jiven\u2019? General Importance / Ticket: \u2018Let me out of here\u2019 / Mental thought: I know the word aesthosphere. This is one of the few occasions so far where I successfully traveled quickly into the future afterwards, with the help of a friend who may have been a Djinn (I wished to time travel on this occasion, after I helped my friend get married to her fiancee). #2: The Airplane: Sept 2007 - July 1990 (?) - Dialogue: What year is it? 1990. Holy fuck! What month is it? August! I -- I -- I can\u2019t say what I mean. I really thought it was September, I mean July. My younger brother looked a lot younger than me in this scene---like he used to look back when we were visiting my Dad in Washington, D.C. (In this same scene I witnessed someone fall out of the airlock of the plane without a parachute! I felt guilty because I thought it was because of the chaos of the time-stream). Brian said: \u201cWho is this old guy? who turned my brother into this old guy?\u201d General Importance / Ticket: In both locations I was on an airplane. Apparently, I rode the waves of entropy to seek a nearly identical plane with nearly identical passengers, and then used the shockwave from arriving to boomerang myself immediately back to where I had been. I hadn\u2019t thought of this immediately, but I may have traveled forwards more years than the difference on the way back out. The name of the game was entropy. #4: My Mother: May 25th 2009(?) -12/28/2005 - Dialogue: What year is it? 2005. What month is it? December. Oh well, I guess I time-traveled. Can I open Christmas presents? You already did! And you got a car! Just kidding. But what year is it really? It\u2019s 2005! General Importance / Ticket: A poem, The ripples in the temporal pool / That mean at first / And then forget to mean / Then learn at last to lie or play the fool, combined with invention of perpetual motion at an earlier endpoint and later return point (e.g. by repeating the event, although officially the repeated event had already happened). This time-travel event caused me to repeat many of the same activities, although with greater confidence. #1: My Own Trickery: Oct. 30, 2006 - Oct. 29, 2006 - Observations: On this occasion I believed in inventing perpetual motion. This provided a possible economic motive for the powers that be to lose me from the current dimension of reality. Since it was such a short distance people doubted that I had time-traveled, but were more likely to believe I was doing something illegal. General Importance / Ticket: Invention of a powerful over-unity device. This event became the focal point for future time-travel occasions, which covered more ground from a later position. #3: The Actor: August 5th, 2009 - July 31st, 2009 - Observations: Seemed to occur through someone else\u2019s decision. General celebration and turmoil due to an actor visiting town caused me to be \u2018lost in the cracks.\u2019 I had already returned once by this point. General Importance / Ticket: Importance of perpetual motion for government. I conscientiously used perpetual motion as a safeguard against loss of immortality, which caused me to gain almost a week\u2019s time at my own expense. Time travel was made easier because a famous actor was visiting the city, causing chaos. #6: Unknown Date, perhaps 2009 - Feb 6, 2015 and returned. Observations: The trip was an encounter with the avatar of Jesus (who didn\u2019t look exactly like Jesus, I thought). The trip was mysterious, as all I did was see more advanced cellphones, and bang with my hand on an aluminum chimney that was supposed to be on the roof of a building I would later live in. The time travel event was later identified as having occurred within the Feb 6th, 2016 framework of the future, as proven by hearing the same noise from inside the apartment. The avatar\u2019s authenticity seems to be proven by his providing knowledge that I would open a fan cover and rotate the fan counter-clockwise (which I did on that same day), and by his providing me with a differently-gendered avatar or vessel to inhabit during my original trip. This was my only major future travel, other than normal forward-directedness. General Importance / Ticket: A magical avatar assisted me. ----The Dimensional Time Travel Toolkit by Nathan Coppedge: The Dimensional Time Travel Toolkit (The Dimensional Encyclopedia Book 15) 1st, Nathan Coppedge - Amazon.com In general the events point towards the importance of a divine Logos concept, semantics, political influence, and a scarce but possible magic power.

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are some stories related to time travelling. Here, I am going to represent some of the real life time travelling incidents .. Pilot Sees a Futuristic Plane This incident was happened when Air Marshal Sir Victor Goddar was sent to inspect an abandoned airfield. When he reached there in very strange condition he saw that the previous abandoned field was now bustling with the mechanics in blue jumpsuits. He saw four planes in Turmac, one of them was of kind he had never seen before. At that time he was pretty familier with all the plane models available at that time. He was shocked at that time and totally confused what was happening with him . But Four years later he was sent back to the airfield. This time he saw that abandoned airfield was full in use, completed with blue jumpsuited mechanics and yellow planes. And sitting on a runway same plane as he saw before and couldn't identify in 1934: a Miles Magister. The Miles Magister was first manufactured in 1937, three years after Goddard first saw it. It is believed in that may be Goddard travelled 3 years in future at that time. Journalist Experiences Air raid 11 years Before it Occurs Journalist J.Bernard Hutton and photographer Joachim Brandt were sent to do story on Hamburg Shipyard in 1932. When they reached there, they realized that they were caught in the middle of air raid. They saw that there was bombing, chaos, gunfire, burning smoke every where. They also snapped some photographs of there. After sometime they saw that everything was normal there, no destruction, no chaos and even no smoke. When they went back to their working place place, they tried to explain everything happened there but no one believed. They even tried to prove themselves by showing the photographs of war zones but everything was normal in the photograph also. But eleven years later, Hutton was really shocked that he read a story about Operation Gomorrah, an air raid on Hamburg in the newspaper. The accompanying photos looked exactly what they had experienced in 1932. Charlotte Warburton Travelled Through Time Without Even Realizing It In 1968, Charlotte Warburton entered a cafe she had never been before. After few days when she tried to go back there, it had vanished. She later knew that, in fact, in that spot, there used to be coffee shop many years ago. It had been repalcd by a supermarket long before that Charlotte claims to have walked in visited it. The man from Taured 1954, a man was stopped by custom officer on Haneda Airport of Tokyo, Japan because he was carrying a passport with stamp of a country that didn't exist. The country's name was Taured, he claimed that the country was in between Spain and France. According to him the country was existed at least 1,000 years where Andorra existed. He also said that he had never heard the name of Andorra. He was given a hotel room and outside his room armed guard were posted. By next morning the man was vanished magically and the passport which was kept on sacurity locker of airport was also gone. Officials never figured out the mystery of man from Taured. Man Who Travelled Back To Time to Become a Wall Street Scam On 28 january, 2003 a man named Andrew Carlssin was arrested for insider trading at the Wall Street. He had made $350 million from the $800 in just two weeks which is nearly impossible. The police arrested him on suspect that he must have had illegal inside information. Later he claimed that he was from the year 2256. Since he was from future he knew exactly how stocks were going to performs. After the bail the man was disappeared from the face of earth and after so many repeated attempts the man couldn't be found. Carlssin predicted the exact date of invasion of US of Iraq. Time Traveller Caught on Camera ? This photo is from the year of 1940s in Gold Bridge, B.C, Canada at the reopening of South Folk Bridge. There were certain crowd at the event. But, in this photo someone doesn't belong.  Isn't that strange ? In a perfectly ordinary gathering he is totally different. He is looking modern at all, fancy goggle, branded T- shirt, coat. Is he from the future at that time ?? The Man Who Met Himself  Unrealistic thing happen with 36 years old Hakan Nordkvist on the 30 August, 2006 while he was passing through tunel of his home to fix some kitchen problems. At the end of the tunnel he realized that he had landed up in future , 2043 in fact because he met himself there, an old man Hakan Nordkvist 72-years-old-self. They even had the same tatto, of course the future guy tatto had little more faded. They even took a selfie together . NOTE : There are many evidences like that in the world, logically they may be time traveller but practically it is not possible now, May be in future it will also be possible coz we know that nothing is impossible.

            "answer_text": "The videos that people see on Youtube are all featuring people using devices that today many people are unaware existed and are confusing them with what we have today. On the other hand, time travel is possible and being developed right now. I\u2019m not talking about from anything Einstein came up with, as he didn\u2019t like the idea of time travel and none of the ideas about time travel, stemming from his work, are even practical. Most would require you to have a space program in order to take advantage of the theories. That\u2019s no solution! Everyone who has looked at time travel and was serious, knows that the answers lie in quantum mechanics and information theory. Anyone mentioning Einstein is just advertising that they are hopelessly outdated. John Archibald Wheeler is the main name to know, among others. For critical information on these new developments, read the links below: Why Those 2 Silicon Valley Billionaires Are Wasting Their Time & Money https://www.academia.edu/34658442/CHANGING_WORLDS_LIKE_TV_CHANNELS_Experimental_Proof_of_Parallel_Universes_in_the_60th_Year_of_The_Everett_Wheeler_Hypothesis_Contains_Copyrighted_Material Tim Folger Discovers A Time Machine Before I conclude, I want to address a statement made in another answer - \u201cIn all time travel theories allowed by real science, there is no way a traveler can go back in time to before the time machine was built. \u201cThis is an example of an amateur who doesn\u2019t know the subject, talking as if he knows what he\u2019s saying when he doesn\u2019t. First of all, this \u201creal science\u201d that he\u2019s talking about is not actually science at all but an unproved idea called a closed timelike curve which no one knows for certain even is possible. It is this geometrical \u201cgraph\u201d that cowardly physicists call a \u201ctime machine\u201d, when it isn\u2019t. A real time machine is a technology, not a natural occurrence. So, so far, there\u2019s nothing \u201creal\u201d in that statement. Furthermore, the reason that it\u2019s said that you can\u2019t go back in time before the machine existed is that the machine, in this case, is the effect of going back in time - so again, it\u2019s not a machine at all. This is why it has taken so long to make any progress in time travel research because the mainstream science community first threatened physicists that wanted to look into it, and then forced them use and rely on theories that were unsuitable. So you have people thinking that they know what they\u2019re talking about because they read it in some pop sci magazine and it\u2019s all a bunch of crap. End of story\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Sir Victor Goddard Will you believe if I say that you can fly into parallel universe? That must be sounding like a fantasy , but it actually happened. While flying over airbase , he found airbase to be in bad condition. Later on, while flying his biplane, he got into trouble due to harsh weather conditions. To avoid an accident, Sir Goddard decided to fly back to the airbase till the weather cleared out a bit. He spotted mechanics wearing blue overalls working on the yellow planes parked on the runway. The planes were different from the ones in use by the air force back then. Air Force painted all their planes in silver which was different from the previous color , that was yellow. Totally baffled by what was going on, he got the shock of his life four years after. Europe was war torn and he happened to visit Drem again. But this time, he saw everything he saw four years back in 1935. He saw same people in blue overalls servicing yellow planes. 2. The man who met himself  On the 30th of August in 2006, 36-year-old H\u00e5kan Nordkvist came back home to find his kitchen flooded with water. He thought of it as a small damage and thought of repairing it own. But when he went inside cabinet , he observed that it continued and he kept crawling. At end of cabinet , he realised that he landed into future. Not only that, he even met his future version and took picture with his future version. They even had the same tattoo. 3. The time travelling hipster  Look at the above photograph carefully. Did you find anything strange with it? The above photo was found on the \u201cVirtual Museum of Canada website\u201d and dates the way back to 1941. This picture is known to be the reopening of the South Fork Bridge in the early 40s in Gold Bridge, B.C, Canada. While it is just another photograph, one cannot help but notice this gentleman in hipster clothes. He doesn't really look like a 'part of the crew' here, does he? Could he have been travelling back in time? 4. The man from Taured This is one of my favourite and curious incidents of time travel. So when at airport police asked his reason for entering county? He replied that he was visiting Japan because of business trip but the movement they checked his passport , his passport showed county \u201cTAURED\u201d which surprised police as there was no country named \u201cTAURED\u201d.  They checked his papers which were completely genuine. He was asked to point out his country on map , in respond to which he pointed finger on \u201cANDORRA\u201d after that he told officers that map is wrong and instead of \u201cANDORRA\u201d the name of country should be \u201cTAURED\". He was then asked to stay in hotel and when police opened door of room the man was not found there. Strange thing is that he was staying at flat which was located at top roof and it was having no windows which he could have used to run. So question remains that who was he and how he escaped from room ?  -Namaste from Batman ",

            "answer_text": "There is a video of a modern watch found in an ancient tomb, but could be fake. If you have a time machine, you need to be able to lock up the time period you left from causality effects, effecting it. Imagine if the time machine you had could move things from the past, from the future. Move a quark out of place in an atom in a grain of sand, on a beach 1000 years ago. Something as little as this, is enough to change the whole history of the earth from that point on.  If you watch videos on the grandfather paradox it is a misconception that you can have enough time to stand in front of him to pull the trigger, let alone have a conversation with him.  You cannot go back in time and get the winning lottery numbers, you cannot kill Hitler, stop Pearl Harbor attack, you cannot save JFK, or stop September 11th. You can only change these things if the time machine can lock up causality effects (keep the time period you came from from causality effects effecting it) But the changes would never count in reality you came from, just the other dimension you went back into, and messed around in. If a machine can do something as amazing as recreate the past, then locking up causality should be no problem for the time machine to do. Maybe people from the future go into the past in the technique I described above, or have the technology to view the past from the future on a television monitor, without causing any causality effects. These are the only two ways I can think of that do not effect causality. In another causality experiment I thought if its the interactions with people, and other things which cause causality, then what if you went back in time into a solid thick steel container, that was buried ten miles deep down in the in moons crust, it would be one mile thick in every direction up, down, left, right, forwards, and backwards. So if you go back in time into the container on the moon, it should not create any causality effects, because you do not interact with anything. The ripple effects of causality have been subdued. There would be dampening systems in the container to stop your vibrations, but it may not be enough, and not work at all. Just interacting with the air molecules could be enough to cause causality, even the space in the container. Dark matter, and energy is still not understood, and time travel into the past into the steel container could have an effect on the way dark matter, and dark energy effect other objects, to maybe cause causality.  Unless the aliens have a time machine, but they are not going to share, because we are about money, greed, exciting our excitatory neurotransmitters, and power, and cannot be trusted, even if we can understand the time machine technology they created, if explained to us by them. Aliens explaining how their time machine works to us, It might be like explaining calculus to a ape. Maybe we are just not smart enough to understand it. The most visited place by a time traveler if possible, would be the bookstore depository where Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK, or the Dinosaur period.   Maybe there is some clues around there of future time travelers, especially in the Zapruder film of JFK being assassinated.  Look at Ronald Mallet's time machine on YouTube, but it can only send information back to the point when it was switched on. There is also this YouTube video below, of Stephen Hawking explaining how to a black hole can be used to time travel into the future, by orbiting the black hole. Hope this helps.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. If you have flown on an airplane, driven in a car, walked or have been standing still, you travel forwards in time. Imagine you have two clocks, and you can (somehow) accelerate one clock to 0.99c. Its currently 4pm. You want to accelerate one clock to Jupiter and back at 0.99c (Assuming Jupiter is at its point in its orbit where it is one light-hour away). You send the clock off on its way. After an hour, the clock reaches Jupiter, turns around, and heads back. When it arrives back at Earth, the clock you accelerated to Jupiter will still say its 4pm, but the other clock will say its 6pm, because two hours have passed for you, the observer, on Earth. But for the clock that has accelerated at 0.99c to Jupiter, only nanoseconds have passed. If you were to accelerate the clock to alpha centauri, 4.3 years would have passed in an instant for the clock. TL;DR The faster a clock goes, the slower it ticks for an observer. Of course, since we cant accelerate something to close to the speed of light, these changes in time are very, very small. But you can still detect these changes by using very precise clocks. These atomic clocks work by measuring how many times an atom (Usually Caesium-133) \u201cwiggles\u201d around. These clocks have an uncertainty of one second in 30 million years, and it can measure time down to the nanosecond. So if you were to have two atomic clocks, and you leave one at home and fly in an airplane with another, you will find out that the clocks have different times. This experiment is called the Hafele-Keating experiment, and it was done in 1971 with commercial airliners flying eastwards and westwards. The clock that traveled eastwards was 40 nanoseconds slower, while the clock that traveled westwards was 275 nanoseconds faster. The ISS travels 0.007 seconds in time every 6 months. An object with any mass bends spacetime around it. That means that if you were to orbit a massive star, you can travel several seconds or minutes forwards in time. The best object to do this with is with a black hole. If you have two clocks, and you were to throw one into the black hole, you will notice that the clock will appear to be ticking slower and slower, before it stops and slowly fades away. This concept of time travel is incredibly useful for calibrating clocks on GPS and Geostationary Satellites - working on a satellite project is the only career where you have to work with special and general relativity at the same time.

The place where it is meant to be placed, in Poland. 2o years later... Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, the date is Dec. 9, 1965: Residents see a ball of fire shooting through the darkening evening sky and then, seemingly, the object ? purportedly shaped like a jumbo-sized acorn after impact ? makes some sort of controlled crash into the woods. From there, the strangeness factor escalates with purported military personnel isolating the area from curious onlookers and toting something out of the locale on a flatbed truck.That was a  metallic, bell-shaped instrument that stood nearly 15 feet tall and 10 feet wide with odd markings along the lower rim. Within was a strange substance known as \"Xerum 525\" that glowed strangely violet when excited and gave off strong levels of radiation. Many of the scientists working on the project died either from radiation sickness or at the hands of SS officers bent of maintaining the projects secrecy.  Some believe, the intense radiation was capable of manipulating time-space for the purposes of time/space travel or to produce anti-gravitational fields. So, that was the Nazi Bell or Die Glocke which crashed in Pennsylvania, USA.The US military officials took it under control and the mystery continues....  ",

What has fascinated those who came across this photo is how out of place the \u2018surfer man\u2019, as some have called him, appears to be. He is wearing a very baggy t-shirt and shorts, sporting a modern windswept haircut and is clearly at odds with everyone else around him. Looking closer at the people around, the man to his left appears to be utterly stunned by his presence. Further to the right a woman also appears to be pointing her hand at the supposed time traveller, leading many to speculate the man was out of place and out of his time. In fact, it almost looks as though he jumped right into the scene as the photo was taken. Considering that other guys in the picture are also wearing shorts, I'm going to say that he's not a time traveler. \u201cOther than Bill and Ted, what time travellers would think that a t-shirt and shorts would be the best thing to wear when time-traveling into the past anyway?\u201d In either scenario, physicists all agree that it is impossible to travel back in time by our current understanding of the universe and its laws. According to Professor William Hiscock, of Montana State University, we can move forward due to the the time-dilation effect of Special Relativity. Moving backwards however is a dead end. ",

            "answer_text": "Is time-travel possible ?(M.Marsden auth \u2018abh Timelessness\u2019) This question gets asked a lot on QUORA, so here is my general response. If you would like some specific details please ask a more detailed question \u2013 you may find the attached video addresses a lot of time, and relativistic \u2018time travel\u2019 issues, in a hopefully more scientific way than most.   Firstly, please note you may get a few answers repeating that Einstein\u2019s Relativity in some way proves time, and suggest time ( as opposed to just space , an rates of change) can be manipulated.  But if you ask for the specific part of Relativity that they think proves time, you will almost certainly find that they have not carefully read \u201cOn The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\u201d themselves, and cannot show that from the outset the paper does anything other than just \u2018assuming\u2019 time.,  (see...   \u2206 Relativity - The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies paper. - A Brief History of Time-lessness - Matt Welcome.) \u2018Time-Travel\u2019In my carefully researched opinion, time travel is completely moot, because we have no valid reason, or proof of, the existence of a thing called time.  For there to be any chance of time-travel, e.g. from or to \u201cthe future\u201d, you would first need some reason to suspect that a thing or place called \u201cthe future\u201d existed, and also some experiment, as per the scientific method, to support your hypothesis. Professor Hawking\u2019s idea of arranging a time travellers party, to see if people might attened \u2018from the future\u2019, is rather unscientific because it is pointless expecting people to come from somewhere,(\u2018the future\u2019) if you have not even established that that place exists. A Simple experiment. Wherever you are, sit and look around you, and ask yourself... \u201cdo I see any evidence at all of a \u2018future\u2019 \u2018arriving\u2019 \u201c? To clarify this question for yourself place any object on a surface and push left to right wit your finger, and look very closely at the object, and ask yourself... \u201cDo I see any evidence at all, whatsoever, that this object is in some way \u2018heading into\u2019 a \u2018future\u2019 as it moves\u201d? \u201cDo I see any evidence at ll that a \u2018future\u2019 is \u2018arriving\u2019 as this object moves\u201d? \u201cDo I see any evidence at all, that as this object moves, it in any way at all leave a \u2019temporal past\u2019 behind it\u201d? \u201cas the object moves, am I actually seeing a \u2018temporal past\u2019, affecting a \u2018temporal future\u2019 in an infinitely thin \u2018present\u2019 \u201c? ... or are you just seeing your finger to the left of the object, pushing it to the right, where your finger touches it? Instead of asking does time exist, or is time travel possible, it may be worth first asking  \u201cIf everything in the universe JUST exists, moves, and interacts in all directions, would that be enough to mislead me into assuming there is also a \u2018past\u2019, and/ or \u2018future\u201d? If you consider the above question carefully you may find what it suggests very interesting, and you may also realise that no other writer on \u2018time\u2019 seems to have thought of, let alone considered and been able to disprove the possibility it suggests. So, for the reasons above, and those in the more technical and detailed video below, I would say sadly time travel is entirely moot. yours Matthew Marsden (Auth \"A Brief History of Timelessness\")A Brief History of Time-lessnessA Brief History of Timelessness: Why it's always now, everywhere.A Brief History of Time-lessness (r2): \"Does Time exist?\", \"What is Time?\",\"Is Time-Travel possible?\"   Considering 'time travel'Time Travel,Timeless Answers to Prof Cox's Science of Dr Who:   ",

The Ghost Train Caught in a Time Loop | The Ancient Ones This is one of the most interesting cases like the ones with MH370.  A small excerpt from the above mentioned link: On June 14th, 1911, Italian railway company, \u201cZanetti\u201d organized an advertising campaign to demonstrate a new type of excursion train. They set up a free trial ride for representatives of the community who were rich and high on the social ladder. One afternoon, a three-car composition with 100 passengers and a crew of 6 left the train station in Rome. The passengers were to see all the local sights. The super long (for its time) 1 meter (3 feet) wide tunnel, carved in the mountains of Lombard, was of particular interest. While waiting to reach the tunnel, passengers were having the time of their life, drinking champagne and sharing gossip\u2026 Just before reaching the tunnel the train slowed down and a gust of black smoke went up in the air.

The Higgs singlet is related to another hypothesised particle called the Higgs boson, dubbed \"God's particle\" because it is associated with giving other particles mass, which the 27-kilometre long atom smasher may produce. If the Higgs boson is created, the Higgs singlet may also appear, scientists say. The theory hinges on a subatomic particle called the Higgs singlet, a particle related to the Higgs boson. The catch is it is not yet clear if the Higgs singlet, or even the Higgs Boson, exist at all. Assuming they do, MSNBC reports that time travel for the Higgs singlet would work something like this: [The Higgs singlet] may have a unique ability to jump out of the normal three dimensions of space and one dimension of time that we inhabit, and into a hidden dimension theorized to exist by some advanced physics models. By traveling through the hidden dimension, Higgs singlets could re-enter our dimensions at a point forward or backward in time from when they exited. Of course, sending a single particle backwards or forward in time is far different than hopping in your flying time-DeLorean and zipping off to the 1950s. But scientists believe that Higgs singlets could be used to send messages backwards or forward in time, thanks to the particle's theorized properties. Vanderbilt physicist Tom Weiler says that this limited time travel is the theory's greatest strength, since it avoids paradoxes and does not violate the current understanding of physics. I'm certainly no expert on deep physics, but even Weiler describes the theory as \"a long shot.\" Only time will tell with this theory, and others, as the LHC continues to enlighten and befuddle us as we try to understand the universe we live in.

But of course, you mean travelling into the past or into the future faster than each of us is doing at the same time. A few points of concern.  Many argue that there can not be any time travel into the past  because we have not seen evidence of time travellers in our own present.  However, it is possible that we simply have not collectively gotten to that point in the future when we develop time travel. Hence, to me at least, it is possible, even likely, that we may develop some form of time travel into the past.  How that will play out given the logical paradoxes remains to be seen.  In general, nature resolves paradoxes.  It seems to me that time travel into the future is unlikely as the future simply doesn't exist yet.  Hence, we can't go there. We are entering the future together, slowly, minute by minute, and at the same speed. By the way, I sell time machines in SecondLife and Tangle Grid. Of course, you can do in virtual reality that which is not possible in real life (NPIRL). ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays the technology is so advanced that you can easily upload a fake video regarding time travel and claim it as being real. Now, if you ask me scientifically and logically its very difficult to accomplish this task, as according to relativity to travel through time you need to attain a considerable velocity. Ideally when your speed is approximately equal to 0.5c, the effect is noticeable( that doesn't mean its large). Now to travel considerably through time your speed should be greater than about 0.7c. But according to special relativity an object moving at such high speed tends to gain more mass as its accelerating thus needing more energy than before to maintain the acceleration. You can keep that up till some point after that its impossible to accelerating any further. At one point the mass increases so much that it starts decelerating due to its intense mass. But, you never know what new technique we could achieve to travel through time. Just a 50 years ago no one thought that we would be working on touch screen phones and laptops. We just have to dream big and work towards it. Lastly, I would like to say that time travel is currently being studied and there is no proof of someone travelling through time. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Firstly, this is fairly common with astronauts; infact there are even world records for people who have travelled in time for the Universe Today points out that due to the effects of time dilation, Krikalev (the current record holder) has actually lived for 0.02 seconds less than everyone else on Earth - effectively, he's travelled 0.02 seconds into his own future. The calculation relies on Einstein's theories of relativity, which state that the passage of time is relative, and different, for two objects moving at different speeds or experiencing different levels of gravity. But don't let the word 'theory' fool you - dilation is a real effect, and has been demonstrated in experiments conducted first by flying highly accurate atomic clocks around the world on jet aircraft, and later by GPS satellites which have to be reprogrammed daily to counter the effect. Every astronaut in orbit around the Earth will undergo some level of dilation, since they are travelling at such great speed (7.71 km/s in the International Space Station) for long periods. Secondly, time slows down around wormholes, and if there are two worm holes in close enough proximity, time can reverse too. Therefore the flow varies and therefore that too is evidence of time dialation and this time travel. Lastly, and my favourite one: the multiverse theory. Everything is possible in every other universe. ",

But these involve sending small things like photons sent back in time fractions of a second. So far (to my knowledge) we have not been able to send people back in time to the distant past. Please visit my site Time.University for a link to work by Seth Lloyd.  I have heard of other people who were trying similar experiments as Seth a while back but at lest one of them went off grid. It is possible someone is using time travel to peek at future stock prices or some similar thing but I dounbt very much that a fully working time machine has been built. In theory it might be done but you might need to invent a way to harvest negative energy in large quantities. Such technology might also be used to build flying cars and taller sky scrapers. Finding a cure for old age might be a simpler task.  ",

The earth (as is everything) is speeding through space, a volume that\u2019s not fully known to us. We can\u2019t say exactly where in space we are because we don\u2019t have a map of the ever expanding universe. It\u2019s not like we can plot coordinates like on earth. So if I went back in time 5 days the earth would be in a completely different place than it is now and although we can say it\u2019s approx \u2018x\u2019 miles we have no idea where that is in relation to all of space. So the likelihood of being able to travel back and landing on earth is so unlikely it\u2019s basically impossible. ",

The reason for this is because the time machines themselves don't travel through time. They simply provide doorways (wormhole openings) for us to walk through to go a fixed time forward or backward in time. For instance, a time machine with a time difference of one year between its openings would be a \"Year-Ago\" time machine. If you want to go back more than one year, just go through multiple times. But you can't go back further than the time machine existed. And if the time machine is ever destroyed, you can't go to the future beyond that point in time. So, no, until a time machine is actually built, we won't be seeing visitors from the future. ",

We already know how to warp spacetime by adding lots of mass or velocity or by the Alcubiere effect, so an extension of this extrapolated into a seemingly exponential rise in technological prowess may in fact yield results sooner than you'd dare to imagine. The past may be more accessible than we know through a principle that we do not yet have proof for; I imagine though it will only be through observation that we will go there, to start with. We may get there and realise that our own past is so dull and inherently dangerous to tinker with, in comparison to the other places we will be able to visit by then, that we simply won't bother. ",

Admittedly it was only factions of a second in the future though. This is due to the theory of relativity where the time passes at different rates relative to the speed at which you travel through space. Due to the speed of the astronauts traveling to the moon and back (also applies to anyone on the international space station) time passes more slowly relativity to time on earth. It can also be said in reverse, to the astronaut time passes faster on earth relative to the astronaut, so when they arrive back to earth they will arrive at some future time. So, yes, a real life example of time travel, that in fact happens quite frequently, but not very exciting as it only relates to a fraction of a second difference. ",

Having this knowledge, I can say that anybody who is moving is travelling slower in time, as the one moving will have time dilated for him. You can read more about this through the twin paradox and a very good example of time travellers would be Muons, which are created in the upper atmosphere and shouldn't survive till the ground ( because of their small lifetime ) but because of their high velocity, their time gets dilated and voila you can detect muons on the ground.

Travelling through time from the present to the past is, in all likelihood, not allowed by the laws of physics for macroscopic objects like people (or even tiny specks of dust).
