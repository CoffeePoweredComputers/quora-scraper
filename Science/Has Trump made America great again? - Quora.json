            "answer_text": "That would have been difficult at the best of times, because the USA was never great to begin with. Let's go back to the extreme of living memory, its entry into World War II. This was delayed not only because of isolationism, but because until 1942 there were still valuable business contracts with the Germans. There was enough official sympathy for the German position that boatloads of Jewish refugees, many of them children, were turned away. During the war, USA became the first country, and the last, to use nuclear weapons against it's enemies, and has retained that option at the push of a button, in the face of 70 years of attempts to reduce the global nuclear threat by negotiation in the international community. Racism was, and still is, a core American value. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, not to mention the rights to free speech and to bear arms, were strictly for white people. America's privatised prisons are disproportionately stocked with black people, and they are 10 times more likely to be killed by police and security forces. That's life and liberty written off, and as for the pursuit of happiness, marijuana was criminalised for 40 years with the express intention of getting black troublemakers into custody. After World War II, returning servicemen were given financial help under the GI bill, most of which was used to purchase property. Black GIs were specifically excluded by legislation from this process, by \u2018redlining\u2019 areas of majority black occupation, so blacks could not get mortgages, or buy property, only rent from white landlords. Throughout the 50s and 60s the Southern states practised overt discrimination against black people with impunity. Racial segregation was indistinguishable from that practiced in South Africa under apartheid. The Civil Rights Movement, which brought an official end to segregation under the Kennedy administration, did very little to change attitudes, and to this day many Southerners mourn the passing of slavery and segregation with attachment to symbols of the traitorous Confederacy, and the same prejudices that characterised the slavery years. In the 1960s, the USA prosecuted pointless adventuristic wars in Southeast Asia, and war crimes against the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, including deforestation and deagriculturalisation by the use of chemical weapons like napalm and defoliants. In the 1970s the USA propped up fascist dictatorships in South America, Israeli expansionism, and apartheid in South Africa. These continued into the 1980s with undeclared colonial wars in Central America that ruthlessly trampled on the aspirations of working people, with assassinations of the leaders and organisers, for the benefit of American business. Throughout the 90s and up to the present day, tentative steps to protect the environment, reduce pollution and greenhouse gases, were persistently nullified by administrations in the pocket of oil companies and mining interests. Many areas of the USA still do not have safe drinking water. Are we great yet? We haven't got to the Iraq and Afghan wars, which destabilized those regions for a generation, and led to the rise of the Taliban and ISIS, all the while working hand in glove with the mediaeval tyranny of the House of Saud, and making sure that any Middle East peace deal would be impossible, funnelling 2 billion dollars a year in military appropriations to Israel as if it were another state in the Union. In the early 2010s, Barack Obama pushed the rules as far as he was permitted, given the structural corruption he was working against, to make America at least hopeful of being great for the first time since the 1930s, when Roosevelt\u2019s program of reconstruction, the New Deal, allowed some broadly socialistic principles shared by the rest of the developed world - Medicare, unemployment benefits, a minimum wage - to creep past the monopoly capitalism that both political parties have no choice but to support. So far from Making America Great Again, Trump has done his damndest to reverse the limited progress Obama achieved, stuffed the administration with sycophants and business cronies, and accelerated the downward slide into oligarchy, austerity, an infrastructural neglect that began 30 years ago under another incompetent showbiz personality, Ronald Reagan. He helped the super rich pull up the drawbridge with the benefit of generous tax cuts, and insulated them from disastrous economic consequences that ordinary Americans have to endure. Working Americans continue to get poorer in real terms than their parents and grandparents had been. Since Trump came into office, America has been abandoned by its former allies, as he embraced and kowtowed to its former enemies. In short, what very little work he has done - he plays an awful lot of golf at his own resorts on the taxpayers\u2019 dollar - has been to guarantee that any kind of greatness was out of reach. ",

            "answer_text": "Has Trump made America great again? It looks funny for any outsider to watch the US politics. Many are truly surprised at the continuous anti-Trump hysteria taken over the Democratic camp and all those leftist leaning folks, including the media ever since Trump took over as President. They seems to have lost their balance. To add to that people like Congresswoman Maxine Waters is almost advocating violence against Trump officials! She said, \u201cIf you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere,\u201d And later she told MSNBC that protesters are \u201cgoing to absolutely harass them.\u201d Such totally immature and irresponsible words from a very high level person can definitely cause violence. What could be the outcome if people fight each other in the streets based on such words? Extremely dangerous.Very unusual behavior we expect from US citizens! More than that, the horrible and terrible US news media. They impose their views on its readers/viewers! And they called it as free press and media! Highest form of journalism! Which west want to impose on rest of the world! Simply disgusting. Certainly above leftist behavior brought down America\u2019s image across the world. Now we know US do not have a free media. They got controlled media. Media controlled from behind. Even the British BBC is imitating them or controlled by same group from behind. What a pity. The truth is there exits no free press any more. If at all such case exists, the rest of the controlled media will simply kill it. That is the saddest part for the world. The so called free world. Old America seems to be on a slow death. It is slowly being replaced with a New America, the leftist, socialist America. May be the Swedish model where people are so conditioned, that they are too willingly to loose their own freedom even. May be Trump could be the last hope for Old America. No wonder the reaction is so strong from other side. Trump in spite of all his negative points, is proving to be a strong leader who really want the well being of Americans citizens. Unlike many of the previous Presidents, Trump did honor so many of his election promises, whether you like it or agree with it or not. So far Trump proved to be very effective. Economy is flourishing. More jobs generated month after months. Trump\u2019s N. Korea policy seems to be effective. Opposite camp is clueless how to take on him. After all they are least concerned about America, instead they want to impose a socialistic utopia in USA. As a strong leader, if Trump could mellow a bit and put some deliberate effort to unite the people, things could take a dramatic turn. However very little chance for that strategy to work in the present turbulent political scenario. After 17 months of Trump Presidency, he proves to be effective in solving problems faced by USA and its citizens. He may not be as good for other nations as one may wish. After all he is President of United States. And that is exactly what he focus too. ",

            "answer_text": "The Trump Administration is just getting started. Depending on what happens in congressional and senate elections in a couple weeks, America will either remember who she is and work toward becoming great again, or take a dangerous veer off the path of liberty and towards socialism. But in answer to your question, in the off chance that you're actually looking for an honest answer, here are ten off the top of my head: Slowed illegal immigration to a trickle and overseen 400 mi of border wall erection in our most vulnerable areas on the southern border.Deported more than 50, 000 illegals that were criminals and gang members and supported our ICE agents and other law enforcement agencies that are doing very dangerous jobsIn the first three years of his administration built the fastest growing economy that we have seen since World War II with record unemployment even among minority communities. This is why by the way I think you will see President Trump receive twice the support from the black community and Hispanic community in 2020 than he received in 2016.Passed the First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform bill that undid ridiculous stuff from the past like the three strikes laws that could put people in prison for life for three minor drug incidents.Instituted Enterprise zones and Opportunity zones targeting inner cities to provide grant money and low interest loans to minorities primarily who wanted to start businesses and employ folks in these blighted citiesInstituted school choice over the objections of the democrat congress and teachers unions and targeted communities to enable lower income people to send their children to schools of their choice rather than be forced to send them to failing government schools. This needs to be expanded to every school district in the United States. Our lackluster public education system badly needs competitionFixed the Veterans Administration and gave veterans the right to have their health care needs met by any hospital of their choice rather than by having to travel long distances to often inadequate government run healthcare facilities.Got the US out of several bad trade deals and renegotiated better ones that leveled the playing field internationally and brought tremendous amount of businesses and capital back to the United States.For the first time in 50 years brought Arab Nations to the bargaining table and to recognizing Israel's right to existence in the Middle East.Got rid of business choking regulations in the energy industry that has led to America becoming energy independent for the first time in 75 years, collaterally that has meant $2 a gallon gasoline, and American soldiers coming home from the Middle East because we don't need their oil anymore.And a bonus for you, appointed three constitutional originalists to the Supreme Court to stem the tide of judicial activism for the next few decades.",

            "answer_text": "Well let's see\u2026.. We now rip babies and children out of their mothers' arms and toss them in cages where they not only do not get medical care or medications but have actually been sexually abused and gave, in a few cases, died. We also \u201cadopt\u201d these children out to American families as if these children were ever UP for adoption in the first place. We also deport their parents back to their country - the country they were trying to get their children out of - where in many cases they're executed for trying to leave. We have a president who fears all that he doesn't understand and that includes: *Politics *The Constitution *Interpersonal relationship skills *Windmills *Wind *Basically all science *History *Government *Intelligence briefings *Word definitions *Spelling *Intelligent speaking *Common courtesy We have a president who has slashed funding and /or support for our CDC, CHIP, SNAP, CIA, FBI, NSA as well as assistance programs for our elderly, struggling families and ill children. We have alienated pretty much all of our allies thanks to a president who lies, is greedy, is ignorant, does not comprehend most matters of importance, and is so far up Vladimir Putin's butt when he talks Putin passes gas. We are mocked by other, actual world leaders for things Trump's done, said, suggested, ignored, tried, threatened, and/or believes. We have a civil war raging now, instigated by our president and kept burning by our president, between political parties as well as between Trump followers and Trump opposers. Our new version of Christianity is a religion centered around a fat, dumb god, while the ACTUAL God is portrayed as being weak and compromising and winking at any sin committed by Donald Trump. Adultery? Dishonesty? Greed? Laziness? Sloth? Cruelty? Sexual terrorism? It's all good if it's all Trump! Our deficit has hit historical levels. Corporations and billionaires are pandered to and coddled by our president as the middle class shrinks and the lower class grows and is targeted by our president and his cronies. The only solution offered to date for gun violence is for Trump to be present so he could take down the shooter with HIS OWN BARE HANDS. We've failed the world by withdrawing from yet another issue Trump doesn't understand - climate change. Our environmental protection is quickly becoming non-existent as Trump manically attacks every single environmental control regulation put in place by Barack Obama. Air, land, water - it's all endangered by Donald Trump and his followers. Our Social Security and Medicare are big targets for Trump & Co. so the money we have put INTO those programs has now been labeled \u201centitlements\u201d and we may never see it again. Medicaid programs are being slashed also as Trump acts on his belief that poor people are worthless and basically need to just die already. Our research of diseases will be quickly declining as Trump further slashes funding for medical and biological research. Dormant diseases can easily pop back up, mutating as well, as new diseases also pop up and, thanks to being made greatly ignorant again, America will have no new, current, helpful research on which to rely. Maybe we can borrow research from other countries who have remained intelligent and updated\u2026.countries we've probably already alienated. Our fellow Americans hit by natural disasters are left to struggle, suffer, and often die, by a president who operates on a PO basis - who's pissed him off and who hasn't. Those who have po'd Trump get no federal assistance, those who have not MAY get some federal assistance and that's really depending on his mood that day. Throwing paper towels at hurricane victims has now become a type of federal assistance. We have racists and racist organizations feeling very much welcomed and accepted by our president - they do include a lot of \u201cvery fine people,\u201d after all. We're seeing the resurgence of straight up, ignorant racism and it's being supported and cheered on by our president and by his frenzied fan club. We have a president who attacks children and not only sexually but also verbally. Especially if they oppose him. Especially if they make a fool out of him. Especially when they are more intelligent and aware than he is. Especially when they school him to hell and back on the basics, realities and dangers of climate change. We have a president whose entire presidential MO is erasing the one man he feels the most inferior to: Barack Obama. Everything about Obama threatens Trump because Obama is everything Trump is not and will never, ever be. Trump believes he can somehow erase Obama and that's exactly what we've watched him try to do since his inauguration. Every day he's reversing, revising, erasing everything Obama achieved during his two, scandal-free, unimpeached presidential terms. We have a president openly mocking a handicapped man, trash talking a dead war hero, openly mocking Christianity, spitting out incomplete and nonsensical sentences which are always wrong or always lies, calling people childish names on social media IN ALL CAPS, spreading rumors and lies about people he dislikes, calling a political party evil and stupid and criminal, sleeping with our biggest adversary while granting him private access to OUR White House, supporting the dismemberment of an American based reporter, mocking gun violence victims, calling himself God, calling himself the savior of America, supporting men who have sexually molested children, taking away our healthcare coverage options, punishing the sick and the poor while giving huge gifts to his fellow a billionaires. We have a president being impeached for withholding assistance from another country unless and until they investigate one of his political rivals. We have an entire political party turned into pack mules, servants, fans, cheerleaders and worshippers of one of the most corrupt, cruel, psychotic, incompetent and fundamentally stupid men to ever slither onto our political stage. The entire world sees our president violating our Constitution and an entire political party supporting him as he does it. We have televised pep rallies where he stands at a podium and performs some cringe-worthy stand-up comedy act, calling people asinine names, calling all Democrats asinine names, spurting lie upon lie upon lie, and making threats as he's worshipped and praised and cheered on by red-faced, flag-wearing, usually obese, frenzied masses wearing ill-fitting, stained and strained \u201cHe can grab MY pussy ANY TIME!\u201d t-shirts and red MAGA hats. We have a president who, in his own words, could \u201cnever understand wind.\u201d We not only have a president who has turned his fat self inside out trying to help Saudi Arabia (you know, the giver of most of the 9/11 terrorists, the country that for months after 9/11 protected the bombers' identities, THAT Saudi Arabia) become nuclearized but we also have his followers SUPPORTING that\u2026.the same group of \u201cpatriots\" who trashed football players for being \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and \u201cunAmerican\u201d because they knelt for the anthem in a silent, peaceful protest against police brutality. It's global knowledge that America is being ruled by a dictator-wannbe, that his ignorance of pretty much all subjects makes us a very weak country, that we can no longer be trusted by ANYONE, that we no longer have any loyalty to anyone besides our president and Putin (and aren't they the same person now?) and that every day we're becoming a bigger and bigger sitting-duck target. We're being \u201cled\u201d by an idiot. We're not protected, we're not strengthened, we're not secure and we're not safe. We're 100% ripe for a takeover by an adversary\u2026perhaps the same adversary Trump is billions of dollars in debt to? Aside from his many, many emotional and intellectual deficiencies Donald Trump has every sign of dementia and, as the live-in, 24/7 caregiver for my mother who was diagnosed with dementia three years ago, I know the signs. The blank stare, the vacant facial expression, the memory loss, the wandering off, the rambling sentences, the nonsensical sentences, the incomplete sentences (reflecting incomplete thought processes), the lack of boundaries, the lack of restraint, the weird moods, the self-centeredness, the childishness and name-calling, the attempts to make his own reality - those are all signs of dementia. More frighteningly, those are not EARLY signs of dementia. They are signs of dementia that's fairly progressed. I do not want my mother controlling even her own checking account yet I should be ok that Donald Trump controls my country, my future, and the futures of my children and grandchildren??? Our country is divided, our religions are divided, our cities and towns are divided, our neighborhoods are divided, our churches are divided, our classrooms are divided, our social media is divided, our friendships are divided, our families are divided - the only thing Donald Trump succeeds at is instigating division, chaos, anger, infighting. And the ONLY thing he has to offer is more of the same. America is not being made \u201cgreat again.\u201d America WAS great until Donald Trump got butt-hurt at Obama making people laugh at him during the 2011 White House Correspondence Dinner (watch a clip, watch Trump's face, you're watching the plan for destroying Barack Obama and, incidentally, also our country, formulate right then and there). America WAS great until Trump descended from above on an escalator, like an old, orange dementor from the sky, announcing his candidacy (AKA the plan to destroy Obama and everything in his path, including America herself). It was right after that that America began losing her greatness and it's been a rapid decline since. Our country right now is regressing at the speed of light. Hate, ignorance, violence, murder, cruelty, apostasy, hypocrisy, racism, bigotry, abuse, mistreatment, greed, greed and more greed, rampant stupidity, Trumpism, brainwashing, unchecked and unmatched corruption\u2026..I'm sorry but these are NOT signs of greatness. And maybe, when Trump takes their Social Security away, their Medicare away, their Medicaid away, their food stamps, family assistance programs, their unemployment or their monthly disability checks away - maybe then the Trump worshippers will wake up to their cold reality: their god betrayed them. Supporting him and praising him and worshipping him and defending him and excusing him and explaining him and trivializing his actions and words, will not protect them. They won't be given immunity, they'll not be given any special treatment because they gave their all to the mighty Trump - they're going to be hit and they're going to struggle and suffer just as much as they want to see all Trump opposers struggle and suffer. You want to make America great again? Then wake up, stand up, speak up against this incompetent, inept, mentally ill man. Vote. Fight for that great America we used to know. It'll be our children and grandchildren who will pay dearly for Donald Trump. Fight for THEM. ",

            "answer_text": "Look around. Are the roads and highways any better?. Are dams being repaired? How about the thousands of bridges that need to be repaired, has the work begun? Is there any improvement in the inner cities? Is healthcare better, cheaper, more inclusive? Is Mexico paying for HIS wall? Are the soybean farmers selling their products to China? Are farmers REALLY happy with Donny\u2019s tariffs? Does your family enjoy spending the extra $1000.00/yr. on you family\u2019s basics due to the tariff\u2019s. Are you happy that we have the biggest deficit and in our history? Do you like the surging trade imbalance we have? Are you happy now that North Korea is now a genuine, international nuclear threat? Do you even care that Donny abandoned our allies, the Kurds in Syria, a war zone? Do you mind that Putin is now a commanding figure in the Middle East? How do you feel about Donny basically telling Germany that there poor allies. How do you like the strained relationships with NATO and each and pro-west European country? What \u201cAllies\u201d is by far the better question these days. Do you like the air you breath now that Federal Air pollution standards have been throw out the window? How\u2019s you water. Raw sewage can be dumped, legally into our streams and rivers. And the allowable containment levels in drinking water, well those limits were made higher than ever by Donny even though scientist\u2019s said specifically, DON\u201dT DO THAT\u201d. There\u2019s more, much more but I am really tired of pointing out the actual calamitous actions undertaken by this president all because President Obama made him the butt of a joke at the annual Press banquet. Donny was bruised by Obama\u2019s comments. And this single action has put him on a path to destroy all the good that President Obama did for our nation. That\u2019s Donny, a vindictive little man, doing everything his Fortune 500 buddies can think of to increase their profits while already ensuring we do not live any longer. That\u2019s right, under this clown, the average lifespan of American citizens has declined. Congratulations Donny, you had us in you gun sights and your killing us quicker than ever. Way to go, fat boy! Let\u2019s talk about the animosity that prevails in our country. Who has fanned the fires of hate and ambivalence in our country for the past three years and five months? Fat Donny, of course. He loves to excite his Evangelical\u2019s, the KKK, the alt-right, white supremacists, and his now most famously noted group \u201cI love the dumb people\u201d with malicious tweets, mean tweets, condoning tweets, and an occasional racial epitaph. Stir \u2019em up. Keep them angry and they will come out in droves to vote for me again is his driving factor. Who cares he killed tens of thousands of Americans ignoring the Corona virus threat for 77 days/. Hell, they probably didn\u2019t vote him anyway. Now hold a rally in Tulsa, against the wishes of everyone that actually gives a damn abut the health of the city. A rally that you won\u2019t pay for, letting the city absorb all the extra costs that must incur making sure Donny\u2019s safe. And by the way Attendees, you must sign away any right to sue me if you are infected and God forbid, you die. I just can\u2019t be sued for a lifetime of wages because some person attended my rally, caught the virus and dies. Sorry about that but your family just has to go on without the money you would have provided. So, do you think AMERICA IS GREAT AGAIN? I think it\u2019s become a cesspool of hate, greed and avarice. Donny\u2019s got to go! He must be voted our of office! Then let the healing begin so America can be a better place to live and enjoy. Bury the ambivalence and let\u2019s all be friends again. ",

            "answer_text": "If we could reach out to the citizens of Pompei in their afterlife, we might find a common thread between their opinions and the citizens who have died needlessly from COVID 19 in the USA. Aside from being cremated, they spent their lives seeking to do what people typically do: to live their lives. While Vesuvius had interrupted their aspersions, so to did the Great Actions by our Commander In Chief. The end results for these individuals have become the same: cremation. It would be hard for me to say if it was more painful to die being burnt to death suddenly; or the weeks long agony for your family to endure your death. What makes today\u2019s cremations so different and difficult to comprehend, is the fact we were warned. Pompei was not. With his \u201cGod given intellect\u201d he had the best advisors telling him \u201c\u201cIt would just All Go Away ~ like Magic\u201d we can see how this has worked out, for him & the dead. And yet he still wants us to believe he is making America Great Again, for those who can survive perhaps. And for those of us who do, we can attempt to rebuild the economy and all the business which have gone, and rebuild the faith in our government after he is gone, and restructure the ways and means our society and law enforcement once worked prior to his rhetoric: \u201c\u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Is this the way to make America Great? It is no wonder this mindset is being protested against. We have been incised by the One Man who should have kept peace in this nation: our President. But ~ he dropped the ball, like countless others. Would we have had better chances if we had the Mighty Casey at bat? At least we would have know ahead of time, we all knew Casey Jones Struck Out. Donald couldn\u2019t hit a home-run. He can\u2019t even hit a line-drive. Any ball he bats turn foul, just like his \u201c\u201cmany popular polls- great ones! So Great in fact ~ they\u2019ll be smiling down from Heaven for what I\u2019ve accomplished!\u201d (In his mind, they were home-runs, but they all turned fowl.) Yes, Donald Trump has done much To this country, and For himself. He will now have something to write about in his up-and-coming book: The Apprentice Graduates, A Stay-At-Home Adventure. All this will eventually sink into even his Perfectly closed mind. What a nightmare this will be when the facades tumble down. I can feel sorry for him then, but not while he is on the horse. He will be The study of what can go wrong in a Democracy like our own, something for the textbooks on the future. In a way, he actually is the catalyst to make America Great again, indirectly tearing down the iconic hallmarks of these United States, singlehandedly toppling the Presidency like a bronze statue of General Lee. He has inadvertently changed the course of history by his ignoble actions: castigating the Senate, like Caligula; treating the people cruelly like Julius; and ignoring the fires while the city burned like Nero. Too bad Epstein was silenced, it would have been nice to have known what Jeffrey knew about Donald, all those parties and businesses dealings. They shared the same town. They shared the same tastes in women. Imagine what a conversation might have been like at one of their parties together: \u201c\u201cWell Don, are you enjoying my hospitality?\u201d \u201c\u201cThis is Great, Jeff! Only in America!\u201d (They had it like that in Rome too, back-in-the-days of Caligula and Julius.) Absolute Power Corrupting Absolutely. Having lived the high life and all the pleasures he could consume, it is no wonder he believed he could continue this increasing power by whatever means it took, running rampant into the Oval Office, as if it were the highest position to attain, providing him bragging rights to the global elite. His Loyal advisors would restrain his actions if his wrath fell out of bounds with protocol. If he couldn\u2019t get something done His way, he would replace the obstacle / person with someone who could. All this has played out before our eyes, our senses numbed and dumbfounded, believing our Commander In Chief would never DO That! But he did, and We The People have paid the price, some with our very lives ~ for his lies. The citizens of Pompei could not avoid their cremation, tragic as it was. The citizens of America did not deserve the avoidable tragedies which have fallen on them. Warning signs ignored, the truth obscured with arrogant lies, political power his only priority; our Leader his in a Bunker like Hitler when the Allies overtook Berlin. With Shock & Awe he had the military gas a peaceful demonstration, sending choppers low to remove the evidence from reporter\u2019s cameras. The then he took a victory walk for his photo-op when protesters disbanded, deeming it safe to climb up from hiding 5 floors below ground. (Can\u2019t justify the troops unless \u201che felt threatened\u201d; an executive prerogative.) Will This man actually have the Secret Service around him for the rest of his life? Can\u2019t we just give him the money and tell him to go away, hire some armed guards rather than staining the careers of more American Service Members? ",

            "answer_text": "Great is subjective but he has made America a whole lot better for the bottom and middle: Released two weeks ago, the Census Bureau\u2019s report on \u201cIncome and Poverty in the United States\u201d for 2019 clearly shows that, pre-pandemic, President Trump\u2019s economic success blew past that of any other presidency. First, the Census Bureau reported that real median household income grew to $68,703 in 2019, an impressive 6.8% increase over 2018. It was the largest one-year increase in median income on record going back to 1967. It was also 45 percent more growth in a single year ($4,379) than Obama/Biden produced in their entire 8 years in office ($3,021). As was the case throughout Trump\u2019s first three years, the economic benefits were widespread. While the overall growth rate was 6.8%, real median income grew by an even greater 7.9% for Black Americans, 7.1% for Hispanic Americans, and 10.6% for Asian Americans. All record highs as were the new income levels for each of these groups. In regards to Trump\u2019s tax cuts: As for talking points about how the Trump tax cuts benefitted only the rich, well, they were false. As incomes grew in 2019, the poverty rate plummeted 1.3 percentage points to a 60 year low of 10.5%. This was the largest reduction in poverty in over 50 years. It lifted over 4.1 million people out of poverty, the largest yearly decrease since 1966. Just for comparison purposes, over the Obama/Biden era, the number of people living in poverty increased by 787,000. Minority groups again experienced the largest improvements. While the overall poverty rate declined 1.3 percentage points, Black poverty fell by 2.0 percentage points, Hispanic poverty fell by 1.8, and Asian poverty fell by 2.8. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) \u201cthe poverty rate fell to an all-time record low for every race and ethnic group in 2019.\u201d Child poverty decreased to 14.4 percent, the lowest child poverty rate observed since 1973 and down from 18 percent at the end of the Obama/Biden era. So much better! ",

She\u2019s now on the shortlist for the first female, and Black female, POTUS in 2024. (i doubt Biden\u2019s running again) So to me that\u2019s pretty great. And apparently her mother was an immigrant. For a person to enter another country and your child can become leader of that country - I mean, that\u2019s pretty great. We\u2019ve also had massive protests for women\u2019s rights, political engagement on liberal ideas, a pandemic that has spurred the call for some form of public healthcare, also Americans experienced a UBI for the first time, and we have the near break-up of the Republican Party into Sane Republicans and Crackpot Republicans, he exposed some weak points in our checks-and-balances, he exposed Obama\u2019s cages and how they could be abused, he settled the question on why and how there can\u2019t be a literal physical wall, there\u2019s also more people making an effort to learn how our government actually works versus how it\u2019s supposed to work, and more! I mean all that is great, great stuff. OTOH, we had/have the 2nd highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression, the 2nd highest death toll of US citizens since the Civil War, we gave China free reign over the Pacific Asian fastest growing economies, the USA has abdicated its leadership position regarding global affairs, it\u2019s now more difficult for minorities to vote in many States, the Administration created the first \u201cSecret Army\u201d in US history that\u2019s answerable only to the President, and new precedents, among many other things. I mean, as a liberal, I don\u2019t want a Democratic President thinking it\u2019s fine to keep all his international business ties\u2026 no, no, no. These things are terribad. But hey, maybe he\u2019s not done. Trump has about a 50:50 chance of re-election. That\u2019s a good chance that he can do more. \ud83d\udc4d ",

            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s just use the numbers, because numbers don\u2019t lie and then my opinion won\u2019t be bias: Covid19 deaths: 200.000 and counting because the administration and the republicans on my opinion are profiteering heavily both financially and politically from the pandemic!Cases: 6.8 million and counting. Just for comparison China lost only 5.000 with a population of 1.4 billion, and few deaths in the second wave that is almost over. When an authoritarian government does a better job than the so called Christian and the richest country in the world, that also brag about having the best healthcare, alarms should sound that maybe this genocide is by design. For ones, cutting entitlements (since most of the deaths are those with pre existing conditions and the elderly, and both the gop and trump have since the pandemic spoke of cutting entitlements), and since 42% of the victims are minorities, and those in the administration and the gop are certainly backed by racists, it make sense and they aren\u2019t even hiding it:  This is roger stone with the leader of the proud boys, who happens to be his personal assistant:   And if that isn\u2019t enough, here is the 1 million dollars of our stimulus given to a Hate group with no employees nor payroll: \n Here is 1.4 billion given to the Catholic Church and now they are investing 10 million in the swing states to get Catholics not to vote to Biden: \n Even his liar in chief got paid(with our small business stimulus, of course) Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s Parents Received at Least $1 Million in PPP Relief Funds https://t.co/XXmivuDhi3\u2014 #TuckFrump (@realTuckFrumper) July 9, 2020\n And to finalized just how racist and corrupt they are, here are the small business that got no stimulus:  Now back to the numbers right? Unemployment: was 4.2% now is 12% to 16%GDP: was 24 trillion, now it\u2019s 21, but the 3 trillion dollars that the fed printed and gave to corporations to buy back their own shares to prop up wall street, to fake people into believing that the economy is doing well, haven\u2019t been added to the deficit nor the GDP yet, if added the GDP is down to 18 trillion in 4 years!Deficit was 18 and now is 26.7(again the other 3 trillion isn\u2019t included, if so it\u2019s 29.7), again in 4 years!Homeless: were 1/2 million and now it\u2019s over 1 million and 14 million are facing eviction!Poverty: was 142 million living under or just above the poverty line, it\u2019s now estimated at around 162 million, nearly 1/2 of the population!Healthcare: there were 37 million uninsured or underinsured (meaning that even though health care is available they can\u2019t afford it! And trump and the GOP are right now asking SCOTUS to end the CARE act that would put another 24 million without health care, also they are the most vulnerable in the USA, that certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to afford healthcare!1 in 5 children go hungry in the USA! Black children die at a rate 3 times higher when treated by a Caucasian doctor than by a black doctor! A black woman die at a rate six times higher during birth than a white one. Blacks are 3 times more likely to be killed by the police. THAT SHOW THAT RACISM IS ENDEMIC!A black, home owning family of 4 make on average 90% less than a white one, and yet trump supporters claim that they are the ones being persecuted for being white!Police is extremely corrupt and have been highly infiltrated by their trailer cousins white supremacists! They are now running the illegal, corrupt, \u201corganized community stalking program\u201d masquerading as community policing, a program exploded by the trump administration to reward his racist trailer park supporters(with out tax dollars), but the main reason is to hide the crimes both the administration and the fusion center agencies and their hired idiots are committing!He signed the executive order making harder to sue corrupt police and agencies for the violations of ones right!Signed the executive order allowing the dod and the Military to spy and stalk targets in the USA!the USA dropped from 6th to 49th in press freedom!It went from 49th to nearly # 1 in the industrialized world for fake news!Education is now 48% out of 49 in the industrialized world!The USA went from having the largest coalition in the UN to now only having Israel and Brazil.(both seeing as pariahs as the USA)!1 in 6 small business closed and another 1/3 are expected to go under. Which is right in line with the interview Trump gave in 2014 when he said he hoped the us economy would crash, then he could by everything at bargain prices and pennies on the dollar, and by coincidence that is exactly what he and the gop have done so far:\n 42% of small farmers are facing bankruptcy! Just like the USA is, after all there is three things trump is really good at and those are, lying/coning, stealing and bankruptcy (bankrupted 5 business so far, and our economy is his 6Th bankruptcy).To him, his administration, his children, his party, his handlers as the Koch industry and the 200 other billionaires that put him in power for the largest transfer of wealth from the lower classes to the wealthy, ever seeing in the history of the world, (here are how many of his administration are controlled by the kochs and the billionaire friends:) \n His corrupt, racist, white evangelicals controlled by the charlatan fascists of \u201cThe Family\u201c:  That themselves are nothing more than corrupt fascist in the hands of the Koch and their billionaire friends, and his handlers in the American, Jewish/Russian, Ukrainian, Russian and the israeli mafias, things are going according to plan! They have so far operated the biggest hoax and heist of not just the us economy and democracy, but destroyed the democracies and robbed the economies of the whole of Latin America and many other countries. It will take the USA decades to get out of the hole they put this country in, and will probably never again recuperate it\u2019s hegemony in the world. And they did it for cheap, that\u2019s why these are their supporters:   In reality I don\u2019t even believe that the kochs, trumps, their 200 billionaire friends are racists, these people don\u2019t see color, they see money, they just use the racists as their base, because they are uneducated, easily impressed and extremely cheap to buy, a simple section 8 will suffice!

First we have to remember we are only 18 months into his Administration, that is early still. I think we are better off with much still to do. Being objective I question some of his policies and completely disagree on some things. The biggest things he has got right are; Niel Gorsuch on the SCOTUS Judge Joe/Jane Doe on the SCOTUS. I'm hoping for Judge Amy Coney. She is brutal. But that will be a fight. Negotiations with Chairman Kim started Challanges to NAFTA Challanges to NATO, next week will be exploding heads at the NATO Conference I think. Travel Ban from Mid East Zero Tolerence Policy on the border. But it severely lacked the needed planning obviously, they just got overwhelmed instantly. Tax Cut He has maintained and improved on the Economy, unemployment, and Stock Market he inherited. I'll give Obama some props there. The military is stronger The VA is better He has met with a lot of foreign leaders, that is almost always good. I'm behind him on the Trade Tariffs and Sanctions. I'm good with getting out of the Iran Deal, it was poor diplomacyfor the sake of diplomacy. He is open to TPP if he can get a better deal. He is open to Paris if we can get a better deal. We were gonna get screwed on that one. He did well moving the Embassy to Jerusalem. We have been saying and promising that for 20 years. I'm okay with challanging allies. I'm ok with, \u201cWe are America, B>/*h!\u201d on some things. We have been walked on long enough. He is willing to deal on DACA. Which is going hard against his base. I'm not sure that will be there after the election. Where I don't agree, at the very top are his looney tunes nasty tweets. I don\u2019t care about his personal life but he needs to clean it up and the nation move on. He has done a horrible time with staffing and it still hasn't settled down. Fire Pruitt at EPA Now. He could have probably handled the Mueller investigation better. I want HRC prosecuted on mishandling and failure to safe guard classified information. If she gets,off, I'm cool with it. Otherwise a bunch of military personnel are really getting screwed. The standard of conduct goes up with increased position not down. I'm a member of the NRA and I want firearms reform. Shooting up schools and churches is not responsible gun ownership. I want money put back into Mental Health facilities. I'm just going to say this flatout. We lock up mental health patients in jail. When released they go back home to their partners who are also often mental health patients. They procreate and create more mental health patients. #breakthecycle I want National Healthcare for all. If that means we can\u2019t go to the damn Moon and Mars then so be it. I want every school age child to have access to high-speed internet and appropriate devices. I want more police and first responders. Stop Sanctuary Cities. I'd like a lot more on education. Rebuild infrastructure. Cut foreign aid to countries that hate us and don\u2019t help us. Build the Wall. I'll stop. My feel from that list is we are better off than we were 18 months ago. But as I said there is much more to do. Just my opinion ",

            "answer_text": "What\u2019s your barometer for greatness? If you believe those pushing the narrative that it was all about racism and putting a white person back in the white house, hey, he\u2019s already succeeded. Of course it\u2019s nonsense and was propaganda to deter people from supporting him. It also fails to address that Clinton is also white, but hey, lets not actually use logic here. I find it amusing that people are saying he did not magically undo everything in the first 100 days so ... failure for \u2026 reasons. I think he\u2019s actually made a good down payment towards fulfilling a number of his promises, but the problem is, is that the GOP is not unified and don\u2019t have the ability to overcome the Democrats in the budget process just yet. So, no money for the wall just yet and no repeal and replace for Obama care. This can all change if they truly go nuclear on all legislation, but I don\u2019t expect that to happen. So, Trump will need a way to lead to a new vision that is yet undefined. But he does have a few success under his belt. The replacement of a Supreme Court Justice with an actual conservative. The Senate Democrats were so used to having their way and having a \u201csay\u201d in who should it be that they are no doubt still reeling from that one. I expect Trump will be able to replace at least one more this term. Perhaps he\u2019ll allow Garland to replace Ginsberg, but the Democrats in the Senate have done nothing but be obstructionists so I can\u2019t imagine that happening.The flow of Illegal Aliens has dropped significantly as the mere threat of actual enforcement for the first time since the days of Reagan makes it less of desirable proposition. If and when he get the all clear to yank the grants that the states signed saying they would enforce the law, yet failed to do so, then I expect those states to cave as the benefits of preserving the illegal alien presence drops significantly.The work towards limiting the abuses of the H1B visas and the like are starting to bear fruit too, but its early yet.The actual enforcement of a \u201cred line\u201d for using chemical weapons on civilians has restored the idea of a leader that is willing to attack more than just the guys on camels or living in caves.Trump\u2019s biggest problem is that the mainstream media is biased against him. Thankfully they are so biased that its obvious. Sadly, he does make it too easy for them at times with his addiction to twitter and willingness to give interviews with people that are hostile to him. Why should he help them get ratings? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read right through this thread and there seems to be some debate among the answers, so I will steer clear of any \u2018internal\u2019 US Trump issues and stick with my perspective as an overseas foreigner who spent his early years as a pseudo American, just off the coast of Florida. Although a British colony, we only had American Radio and TV, millions of American visitors, and went back and forth freely to florida to do our shopping. We even shared your international telephone Country Code for god\u2019s sake. Anyhow, I was a real admirer of America and Americans. In particular I loved your patriotism. Then, my family migrated to Australia. . . Talk about a change, Australia was certainly a very different country. The thing that hit me the hardest was how \u2018insular\u2019 America was/is. I quickly realised that your great patriotism extended to the \u2018free press\u2019, i.e. your media all but ignored foreign matters (at that time) and I suspect out of blind patriotism would never air anything that wasn\u2019t pro-American. And I mean no offence, but what US citizens heard was heavily censored, almost like China or Russia, but not by the government. From the 50 to the late 70\u2019s America was great! But as a saddened admirer, I have watched (from afar) the steady decline of the U.S. over the last 30 years, but many Americans are still living with the glorious 60\u2019s \u201cwe are the greatest\u201d false belief. Has Trump Made America Great Again?The one indisputable fact is that Trump has made America the world\u2019s greatest \u2018laughing stock\u2019, as the dictionary puts it \u201cfigure of fun, object of ridicule, dupe, butt, fool, joke, standing joke\u201d. It really does sadden me to say that, because it appears you are the last ones to realise it. Personally, I think democracy has gone off the rails. I believe Americans like citizens in many other democratic countries are increasingly faced to choose between one self-interested group or another and out of desperation we have seen some of least suitable leaders imaginable. When you are forced to choose between the biggest crook in town, or the village idiot, who are you going to vote for? I generally don\u2019t follow American politics as we have our own political merry go round here, but I think it says a lot when the post 911 pain is still there and anti Muslim sentiment was at a peak, not only does America vote in a Koran toting Muslim, but a black American Muslim. Up front, I don\u2019t have a problem with non radical Muslims or black people!!! Thankfully I learned to dislike racism and discrimination at a very early age, and try to treat everyone as I would like to be treated. Having expressed my surprise about Obama being elected, from what I can tell he did a much better job than every other president I can recall since Nixon got caught out. Since then voters seem to have picked one doozie after another. When Trump first mentioned he might run, I knew for a certainty he was a shoe-in. Seriously . . .Because of the power America wields, you folks (American voters) have a huge responsibility. The rest of the world relies on America to keep Russia and China from getting the idea of doing a hitler. China has a massive population who have work ethics like nobody else, all wanting their fair share of the greed America and other countries have been enjoying. An unstoppable force, meeting head on with an immovable object, you don\u2019t have to be a genius to believe there are big changes ahead. Those of you who really understand the \u2018Bay of Pigs\u2019 events need to ask where the world would be if Trump were there instead of Kennedy. With Russia having suffered a big setback, China has its eyes set on it\u2019s turn as World Leader, making diplomacy the most critical asset any leader needs to have. And instead or an intelligent diplomatic leader you have chosen to have what appears to the rest of the world as a President who has spent his entire life demanding or taking everything he wants, with a total disregard of moral, ethical or legal standards. Someone, from what I can tell is globally regarded by psychiatric professionals as a textbook narcissist with grandiose self importance, almost certainly on the edge of senility. He doesn\u2019t hesitate for a moment to declare himself the greatest president American has ever had, the world's greatest businessman, and I suspect will declare himself the world's greatest forest fire expert any day. At this moment, if I had to choose between giving the big red nuke button to Trump or Kim Jong Un, it would be a difficult choice and based on the past year, I think I\u2019d hand the button to North Korea as at least he fears/respects China and I think they would secretly cut the wires anyhow. No, right now America is in peril and many other countries could be taken down with it, meanwhile some toddler in his own \u2018make believe world\u2019 plays with gasoline, explosives and matches, while you seem content to just watch on, and your biggest concern seems to be about the \u2018Great Wall of Trump\u2019. Please, start adding lots of toilet paper to your international care packages, because the rest of us are sh\u2026.. Talk about your big bang theory, it sure feels good to have gotten all that lot out, It's been bottling it up for ages. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cGreat again.\u201d The question is, how will we measure \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201cagain\u201d? What were the halcyon days of the United States and in what ways? The GDP Definition of \u201cGreat\u201d\u2014 The White House, despite all its internal, warring factions, is defining \u201cgreat\u201d strictly in terms of economics: GDP, job numbers, and Americans\u2019 disposable income (a questionable indicator of The American Dream). You would think that by paring down the dozens of issues that affect the U.S. and its people to these three would make it very easy to be \u201cgreat.\u201d The Historical Definition of \u201cAgain\u201d\u2014 But maybe, not great again; even during the Reagan years, people in the bottom tiers of the U.S. socioeconomic classes were struggling, some kinds of taxes were replaced by other kinds of taxes. Unemployment tends to follow international economic swings, so the fact that things actually got worse while Reagan was president is somewhat similar to what President Obama inherited as the globe was taking an economic dive (in large part due to financial institution over-extension with debt offerings). Again? Under FDR? Truman? Nixon? Reagan? Bush #1? Bush #2? The 2017 Federal Budget Definition of \u201cGreat\u201d\u2014 Almost every issue is now framed in terms of theories about what will make the U.S. GDP grow faster than that of other countries. The exceptions are increases in military funding, Dept. of Homeland Security funding, and a $1T investment in \u201cinfrastructure\u201d (to be a shared expense with businesses that participate). \u201cThe Wall\u201d is based on a different theory of economic benefits vs. the cost of construction, maintenance, and staffing. Drawing from the White House budget document, we can see the places where Americans can expect less: Major reduction in healthcare insurance availability and in healthcare services available.Reduced and eliminated financial institution regulatory oversight (reintroducing the circumstances that led to the financial institution collapse of 2007\u20132008)Substantial reduction in access to Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, temporary financial assistance (aka \u201cwelfare\u201d), and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program for families living in povertySubstantial reduction in government oversight/administration of student loansSubstantial reduction in funding for teacher training, after-school programs for children living in poverty, and programs designed to give children living in poverty and those with disabilities or other learning disadvantages a \u201cboost\u201d in completing their education and being prepared for post-high school education/training; move from support for public schools to greater support for private and religious K-12 schoolsReduction in support for farmers/agriculture (plus the elimination of much of the workforce that plants, tends, and picks the crops)Reduction in retirement benefits for federal employees (other than senators and House representatives)The devil is in the details. For example, a quick look at the spreadsheet in the budget document shows that the federal deficit decreases as percent of GDP for a couple years, and then it increases as percent of GDP. Another issue is whether the targets for these reductions are achievable. As an example, look at reductions in Medicaid as a way of understanding what\u2019s behind some of these cuts. The major fraud committed with Medicaid comes from healthcare providers. (In Medicare, the major fraud is split between insurances billing for services not received by patients and healthcare providers delivering treatments that are not needed or are over-billed.) However, the \u201cremedy\u201d being offered in Congress and the White House is to reduce the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid. It\u2019s not clear how remedying something other than the root cause of the problem will make things great for anyone other than those insurance companies and healthcare institutions that are unscrupulous. And then there\u2019s this: The theories about rapid GDP growth for middle- and working-class Americans and for the working poor are based on a premise that has been proven false: When corporations make more profit, their shareholders benefit, especially if they don\u2019t expand their workforce. By law, corporations are required to maximize shareholder returns. The stock market rise is based on the belief that corporations will continue to make record profits, not that they will expand their workforce. We\u2019re already great! The U.S. is already great. In fact, in many ways, it\u2019s the best it\u2019s every been\u2026 even if you just look at GDP. Yes, the U.S. can get even better, but that\u2019s different from claiming it\u2019s not great now and it will be later. Unfortunately, \u201cMake America great again!\u201d has a sound bite advantage over \u201cMake America even better than it\u2019s ever been!\u201d American nostalgia for what never was is infamously resistant to facts. U.S. Quality of Character\u2014 Since the November election the rest of the world has been judging the U.S. more harshly. They had their frustrations with G.W. Bush and Barack Obama\u2014 frustrations that pale in comparison to what they\u2019re feeling now. They\u2019re judging the President and the 63 million Americans who voted for him because the White House\u2019s notions of what makes a \u201cgreat\u201d country should include a lot more than GDP. Let\u2019s assume that a \u201cgreat America\u201d has something to do with the \u201cquality of character\u201d of the nation in the way that it treats its citizens, residents, and world neighbors. Quality of character includes being honest & prudentself-disciplined in behaviorrespectful of otherscollaborativewell-informedgenerous/benevolentdependablepersistent & consistentprincipled (making decisions and behaving based on fundamental ethical principles)benevolent/generous (of spirit and deed)responsible (taking responsibility for one\u2019s words and deeds, plus looking out for all Americans, in our case)In other words, for the U.S. to be \u201cgreat,\u201d its leader(s) need to have these qualities of character. Of the eleven characteristics listed, President Trump demonstrates about one (persistent but not consistent; principled in some ways and lacking integrity in others\u2014 awarding 1/2 for each). Quality of Character and Treatment of Americans\u2014 Further marginalizing people living in poverty, including the working poor (67% of those on Medicaid), taking funds from the public schools that working-class and poor families must depend on for a quality education, and increasing the financial assets of the upper class disproportionately more than that of the middle- and working-classes are actions that are contemptuous of many, if not most, Americans. This is a consistent mentality: The wealthiest nation on Earth should do whatever it can to accelerate its economic growth, even at the expense of others. And the wealthiest individuals in the U.S. should do whatever they can to accelerate their financial growth, even at the expense of the rest of the nation. This is not a mentality we normally associate with a high quality of character. It is selfish in terms of assets and power. It applies to many in the current White House. Quality of Character and Treatment of Allies\u2014 Since the beginning of Donald Trump\u2019s bid for the presidency, he has maligned, snubbed, and disrespected U.S. allies and their leaders while praising despots like Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un, and Rodrigo Duterte. His profound deficit in knowledge about world affairs is not just a deficit in being well-informed; it is actually a deliberate preference not to know the facts: He would not attend intelligence briefings after the election, deeming them a waste of his time; he says he does not like to read and prefers to base decisions on his \u201cgut.\u201d In a meeting with President Xi Jinping, Trump volunteered that ten minutes spent talking about North Korea introduced him to some of the complexities in dealing with Kim Jong-un and that government. (And that statement was given the same importance, by Trump, as noting that the chocolate cake they\u2019d had was \u201cfantastic.\u201d) However, it is not just Donald J. Trump who is treating allies with disregard. There are others in the White House who are rabid nationalists (not just Steve Bannon, by the way). To be clear: Most members of the U.S. Congress, especially the Senate, recognize the importance of respectful and tactful international relations\u2026 especially with allies. They, too, represent the nation and, in that capacity, their quality of character should be acknowledged, at least in that regard. Can President Trump make America great again? Probably not, unless we consider only GDP and not who within the U.S. benefits from that. Surely not, if we consider the quality of character of the nation\u2019s leadership and the nation\u2019s domestic and foreign policies. ",

Trump, his senior aides and supporters in Congress have regularly complained that the media isn\u2019t covering the achievements of the administration. Below is the White House list: 500 DAYS: In his first 500 days in office President Donald J. Trump has achieved results domestically and internationally for the American people. \u2022\tSince taking office, President Trump has strengthened American leadership, security, prosperity, and accountability. \u2022\tAfter 500 days, the results are clear: the American economy is stronger, American workers are experiencing more opportunities, confidence is soaring, and business is booming. \u2022\tPresident Trump has re-asserted American leadership on the world stage, secured vital investments in our military, and stood up against threats to our national security. \u2022\tPresident Trump has put the American people first and made government more accountable. AMERICA\u2019S ECONOMY IS STRONGER: The American economy is stronger today and American workers are better off thanks to President Trump\u2019s pro-growth agenda. \u2022\tNearly 3 million jobs have been created since President Trump took office. \u2022\t304,000 manufacturing jobs have been created since President Trump took office, and manufacturing employment stands at its highest level since December 2008. \u2022\t337,000 construction jobs have been created since President Trump took office, and construction employment stands at its highest level since June 2008. \u2022\tUnder President Trump, the unemployment rate has dropped to 3.8, the lowest rate since April 2000, and job openings have reached 6.6 million, the highest level recorded. \u2022\t67 percent of Americans believe now is a good time to find a quality job, according to Gallup. \u2022\tOnly under President Trump have more than 50 percent of Americans believed it is a good time to find a quality job since Gallup began asking the question 17 years ago. \u2022\tPresident Trump prioritized job training and workforce development to empower workers to seize more opportunities, signing an Executive Order to expand apprenticeship opportunities. \u2022\tPresident Trump has restored confidence in the American economy, with confidence among both consumers and businesses reaching historic highs. \u2022\tConsumer confidence in current conditions has reached a 17-year high, according to the Conference Board. \u2022\tOptimism among manufacturers has hit record highs under President Trump, according to the National Association of Manufacturers. \u2022\tSmall business optimism has sustained record-high levels under President Trump according to the National Federation of Independent Business. \u2022\tPresident Trump signed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law, cutting taxes for American families and making American business more competitive. \u2022\tAmerican families received $3.2 trillion in gross tax cuts and saw the child tax credit double. \u2022\tThe top corporate tax rate was lowered from 35 percent to 21 percent so American businesses could be more competitive. \u2022\tPresident Trump has rolled back unnecessary job-killing regulations beyond expectations. \u2022\tIn 2017, President Trump far exceeded his promise to eliminate regulations at a two-to-one ratio, issuing 22 deregulatory actions for every new regulatory action. \u2022\tThe Administration rolled back rules and regulations harming farmers and energy producers, such as the Waters of the United States Rule and the Clean Power Plan. \u2022\tRegional and community banks and credit unions got relief after President Trump signed legislation reducing harmful requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. \u2022\tSince taking office, President Trump has advanced free, fair, and reciprocal trade deals that protect American workers, ending decades of destructive trade policies. \u2022\tDays after taking office, the President withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations and agreement. \u2022\tPresident Trump\u2019s Administration is working to defend American intellectual property from China\u2019s unfair practices through a range of actions. \u2022\tThe President improved the KORUS trade agreement with the Republic of Korea, which will allow more U.S. automobile exports to South Korea with lower tariffs and increase U.S. pharmaceutical access to South Korea. \u2022\tAmerican agriculture has gained access to new markets under President Trump. AMERICA IS WINNING ON THE WORLD STAGE: President Trump has re-asserted American leadership on the world stage and is achieving results for the American people. \u2022\tPresident Trump followed through on his promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. \u2022\tPresident Trump ordered an end to United States participation in the horrible Iran deal and immediately began the process of re-imposing sanctions that had been lifted or waived. \u2022\tThe President has taken action to confront aggression by Iran and its proxies. \u2022\tThe Department of the Treasury has issued a range of sanctions targeting Iranian activities and entities, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force. \u2022\tUnder President Trump, the United States has led an unprecedented global campaign to achieve the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. \u2022\tPresident Trump\u2019s leadership has contributed to the return of 17 Americans held overseas. \u2022\tIn May 2018 alone, Venezuela released one American and North Korea released three Americans who came home to the United States. \u2022\tThe President has secured historic increases in defense funding in order to rebuild our Nation\u2019s military with the resources they need, after years of harmful sequester. \u2022\tPresident Trump signed legislation to provide $700 billion in defense spending for fiscal year (FY) 2018 and $716 billion for FY 2019. \u2022\tThe United States has worked with international allies to decimate ISIS. \u2022\tPresident Trump ordered strikes against Syria in response to the regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons in April 2017 and April 2018. \u2022\tThe Trump Administration has imposed a range of sanctions on the Maduro dictatorship in Venezuela, including sanctions targeting Maduro and other senior government officials. AMERICA\u2019S COMMUNITIES ARE SAFER AND MORE SECURE: President Trump has worked to secure our borders, enforce our immigration laws, and protect the safety and security of American communities. \u2022\tDespite limited resources and obstruction from Congress, President Trump has worked to take control of our border and enforce our immigration laws. \u2022\tPresident Trump has called on Congress to provide the resources needed to secure our borders and close loopholes that prevent immigration laws from being fully enforced. \u2022\tPresident Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard to help secure our borders. \u2022\tPresident Trump\u2019s Administration has carried out immigration enforcement efforts based on the rule of law. \u2022\tFrom the start of President Trump\u2019s Administration to the end of FY 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) made 110,568 arrests of illegal aliens. \u2022\tArrests made in this timeframe represented a 42 percent increase from the same timeframe in FY 2016. \u2022\tOf the 110,568 arrests made, 92 percent had a criminal conviction, pending criminal charge, were an ICE fugitive, or had a reinstated final order of removal. \u2022\tPresident Trump has made clear that his Administration will continue to combat the threat of MS-13 in order to protect communities from the horrendous violence the gang has spread. \u2022\tIn 2017, the Department of Justice worked with partners in Central America to file criminal charges against more than 4,000 members of MS-13. \u2022\tThe Trump Administration has cracked down on the import and distribution of illegal drugs in order to stop them from reaching our communities and causing even more devastation. \u2022\tAs of April 2018, U.S. Border Patrol has seized 284 pounds of fentanyl in FY 2018, already surpassing the total of 181 pounds seized in FY 2017. \u2022\tThe President has launched a nationwide effort to fight the opioid crisis, which has devastated communities across America. \u2022\tThe President\u2019s Opioid Initiative seeks to reduce drug demand, cut off the flow of illicit drugs, and save lives by expanding treatment opportunities. \u2022\tPresident Trump signed an omnibus spending bill which provides nearly $4 billion to address the opioid epidemic. \u2022\tThe bill included $1 billion for grants focused on the hardest hit States and Tribes and provided funding for a public-private research partnership on pain and addiction. AMERICA\u2019S GOVERNMENT IS MORE ACCOUNTABLE: Since taking office, President Trump has worked to ensure government is more accountable to the American people. \u2022\tPresident Trump has confirmed the most circuit court judges of any President in their first year, and secured Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation to the United States Supreme Court. \u2022\tPresident Trump has signed legislation to bring more accountability to the Department of Veterans Affairs and provide our veterans with more choice in the care they receive. \u2022\tPresident Trump signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, improving processes for addressing misconduct. \u2022\tPresident Trump signed the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act into law, authorizing $2.1 billion in additional funds for the Veterans Choice Program. \u2022\tPresident Trump successfully eliminated the penalty for Obamacare\u2019s burdensome individual mandate. \u2022\tThe President\u2019s Administration is seeking to provide more affordable health coverage and broader access to affordable alternatives to Obamacare plans. \u2022\tPresident Trump has released a blueprint to lower drug prices for Americans. \u2022\tPresident Trump has ensured that the religious liberties and conscience of Americans are protected and respected by the Federal government. \u2022\tPresident Trump signed an Executive Order to protect the free speech and religious liberties of groups such as the Little Sisters of the Poor. \u2022\tThe Department of Justice issued guidance to all executive agencies on protecting religious liberty in federal programs.

            "answer_text": "Here we go again. I cannot help but wonder when America stopped being great, but I do believe it began sometime around the end of 2016. It was around that time we decided that we no longer would help lead the fight against climate change. It was somewhere around that time that we decided that putting prekindergarten children in cages was a good idea. It was about that time that we decided that our historic allies were no longer worth supporting. We decided that leaders like Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong Un, President Erdogan, and the Saudi Royal family were the type of leaders we should associate with. We made the decision during this period that jailing our opposition sounded like a legitimate rally cry. The promise of the President of the United States to pay the legal fees of thugs who would attack his opposition at his rallies became the norm. To attack members of one's own party with childish nicknames and innuendoes now sounds like acceptable political strategy. I am waiting to hear the President yell \u201cNanna nanna boo boo\" at his next debate. I have watched America's honor being questioned by the Kurds and the Ukrainians. Is this what Making America Great Again looks like? We are rapidly becoming a laughingstock among the nation's of the world. Is that the definition of Great now? We have a President who cannot speak in an orderly manner and has a vocabulary reminiscent of an elementary school student, and that is considered Great? I realize I am probably going to make some people angry, but we have to stop this insanity. Donald Trump is not characteristic of what America stands for. In fact he is the antithesis of what we have historically represented. America was Great, then we elected Donald Trump and everything just fell apart. As the famous Ricky Ricardo said, \u201cWe have some splaining to do\". I know, you have to be kind of old to know about Ricky Ricardo and that quote. Look it up. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a great job. My 401K is doing so well that I might be able to retire YEARS earlier than expected. The economy is actually doing well for everybody not forced into unemployment by governors determining who gets to live or die. Gas prices are reasonable and I can buy toilet paper again! On a personal note, the \u201csky is falling\u201d claims that those of us in the LGBTQ+ community would be marched off into gas chambers hasn\u2019t materialized and won\u2019t. From a climate perspective, the glaciers are still melting, and will continue to do so as long as India and China don\u2019t have to abide by any climate accords. But we have banned plastic straws in California!!!! The world is saved!!!! We haven\u2019t started any new wars, or invaded any countries. A cruise missile here or there, but nothing to get excited about. COVID-19 is everywhere, and every nation leader is being blamed for everything. It\u2019s the same story in every country. Riots and (ahem) peaceful protests are breaking out in cities around the country with looting and burning down of businesses and homes. This, of course, is all Trump\u2019s fault, just as Ferguson, Baltimore and others during the Obama-Biden administration were Obama and Biden\u2019s fault. The police are still corrupt and shooting people of color, but they are awesome as long as they are trying to take down a president. The fact is, the typical person in America is going on with life just fine. It really doesn\u2019t matter much who is in the White House for most of America. The Federal government is all about regulations, taxes, military, and overall economic stability. And frankly, we\u2019re remarkably stable. Most people really couldn\u2019t care less about all the shouting in the political landscape. It\u2019s a very rare thing that the President does that has any direct bearing on our everyday lives. And this is the problem. As long as the people are doing well, they don\u2019t have any compelling reason to change what seems to be working. In fact, the threat of change (we\u2019re going to take your guns away, make you ride public transportation, raise gas taxes, etc.,) is more of a turnoff than any perceived threats to humanity Trump is said to pose. And nobody is being forced to speak Russian yet, so that narrative doesn\u2019t seem to be flying either. Most people realize that COVID-19 is a global issue and are more angry at their mayors and governors than they are Trump. They go into the grocery store, but can\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t go into their church. They don\u2019t blame Trump for that. It\u2019s not Trump that is forcing their kids to stay home from school, it\u2019s somebody else. Trump\u2019s America? It\u2019s only bleak for some. But for everybody else, it\u2019s business as usual. As long as they don\u2019t watch the cable new channels, which most don\u2019t because there are dozens of scripted reality shows they\u2019d rather watch. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello! I can answer that question. Trump is a magician whose only magic trick is convincing a group of backwater racists that he shares the same values as they do. Trump has mastered the art of tapping into their racist beliefs, thereby convincing them that he\u2019s one of them, when in fact, he\u2019s never been one of them. He grew up rich, dodged the Vietnam War and inherited the majority of his wealth. Trump\u2019s true allegiance has always been to Trump and his willingness to maintain that allegiance is not rooted in American values. Trump will sell himself to the highest bidder no matter where they are from. The magic of Trumpism is that his followers actually believe that the huckster is a true patriot, just because he hates what they hate. So, because he\u2019s willing to rip migrant children away from their parents at the borders or rage against black NFL protesters who want to see an end to police violence against African Americans, he\u2019s one of them. Except when it comes to Trump\u2019s businesses. For years, Trump\u2014whose wife Melania is an immigrant whose parents are also permanent, legal residents and yet no one knows how this happened\u2014has used labor outside of the United States to make his shitty wares (remember the historic television moment when David Letterman called Trump out for having his ties made in China?) So the news isn\u2019t shocking, although it should be, that while the Trump administration and their zero-tolerance border policy left some 3,000 migrant children in custody with no idea how to reconnect them with their family, Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, in Palm Beach, Fla., is looking \u201cto hire 61 foreign workers to serve as waiters and cooks during the winter social season,\u201d the Washington Post reports. And yet, Trump\u2019s base is not screaming about jobs being taken from Americans! There aren\u2019t any Trump supporters talking about how this goes against the fabric of what America was built on. There have been no segments on Fox News exploring the shift in Florida economics when foreign workers take jobs from Americans. Because it\u2019s all bullshit\u2014all the faux outrage and drummed-up drama; all of Trump\u2019s rants about murders and MS-13 and Mexican rapists is all bullshit and that\u2019s the magic of Trump\u2014his ability to say one thing while doing another and never losing his connection to the base. They don\u2019t hold him accountable for anything. In fact, Trump has made following a Trump news cycle an Olympic event. What he says Monday holds absolutely no weight on Tuesday and no one who supports him cares. So Trump\u2019s shitty elitist club with tons of health code violations is looking to hire 21 cooks and 40 waiters and waitresses all from overseas to work October to May and then, once their work is finished, they will be asked to return home. And no one inside the Trump administration thinks this is a bad look? Just the optics of this would be jarring for any other administration, considering how unwavering this one has been on immigration, except when it concerns the president\u2019s family or business interests. \u201cThe postings show that\u2014despite Trump\u2019s insistence that immigration is holding down wages and crowding out native-born American workers\u2014his club believes it cannot find any Americans in South Florida who are qualified to hold two very common restaurant-industry jobs,\u201d the Washington Post reports. The Mar-a-Lago Club is not only looking to hire workers from overseas, they\u2019re looking to pay them less than they did just a year ago. Here\u2019s how the Washington Post breaks it down: These postings give some hints about the business Trump\u2019s company expects at Mar-a-Lago this year\u2014and also about what it is willing to pay workers, in a time of slowly rising wages. This year\u2019s postings show Trump\u2019s club wants to hire one more foreign cook than last year. But it is seeking to pay those cooks slightly less than in 2017: the posting says Mar-a-Lago\u2019s pay for cooks starts at $13.31 per hour, down 3 cents from the year before. The posting for waiters shows Trump wants to hire five more foreigners for those jobs than in 2017. The base salary his club is offering to waiters is higher in 2018: It rose from $11.88 per hour last year to $12.68 per hour this year. The Post notes that after Trump noted that tiki-torch-wielding white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va., were \u201cvery fine people,\u201d many longtime charity clients quit hosting events at Mar-a-Lago, which Trump has called his \u201cWinter White House.\u201d Now the club\u2019s ballrooms have been rented out by \u201cYoung Republicans, the Christian Broadcasting Network and a group of superfans called \u2018Trumpettes USA,\u2019\u201d the Post reports. I guess the one really shocking thing here is that nothing is shocking here. Trump will continue to do what he always does, which is speaking out of one side of his ass while being spanked on the other with a rolled-up Forbes magazine. And no one: not a Republican, not his followers, not the 53 percent of white woman who voted against their self-interests, can explain how any of this makes sense. So no, Trump\u2019s not making America great again but rather the opposite\u2026 This answer is attributed to all the links applied in the text. ",

Because the USA was great. 2016 came and Trump got in office. And I expected as most did: \u201cHe will tone down and govern to ALL Americans, and American institutions are so strong, we will not be able to cross the line, because Americans will defend their Constitution to death\u201d. Wheat I\u2019ve seen happening from 2016 until today is a disgrace. I not only think America is no longer great. Trump is the symptom of a bigger problem, a problem which has been there for a long time. But the problem was contained, and Trump enabled it and set it loose, showing the world the worst of America. America was called \u201cthe leader of the free world\u201d. In the face of this pandemic, and how Trump treated his own people and people from other countries, the are definitely not the leader anymore. They lost that position. The international community doesn\u2019t trust America anymore. And I, myself, quit the dream of moving back to America. I quit because I don\u2019t consider America \u201cgreat\u201d anymore. Suddenly, staying in my \u201cshithole country\u201d (using Trump\u2019s definition) feels better than moving to America. But hey, that\u2019s good news: One less immigrant \u201cstealing American jobs\u201d, right? Why couldn\u2019t he \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d? Because America was already great before Trump. Not without its issues. But great. And it took one con-man to destroy over 200 years of building that greatness. All I can hope for the American people is, they change the Administration and work on the recovery. And it will take a lot of work and effort to rebuild from the wreck Trump is leaving. I honestly want to see America recover. ",

            "answer_text": "No, reminds me of the movie The Ugly American . Trump is an embarrassment to the country and has embarrassed us on the world stage He ALWAYS managed to prove that he really is just as obnoxious and unlikable by saying or doing something obnoxious almost immediately. Unless, a person is a Trumper, Donald Trump is obnoxious, only on steroids. It\u2019s ALMOST like he cannot say anything kind, anything compassionate, anything to bring our nation together\u2026 ANYTHING THAT IS REMOTELY NORMAL FROM A PRESIDENT\u2019S MOUTH. And HE IS serving as our nation\u2019s president and has been for over two years. He is not just learning the job but he is still making rookie gaffs, Plus, I hate to break the news but: He is RUNNING OUT OF \u201cTHE BEST PEOPLE\u201d to fill all those necessary appointments that a president has to make. They keep getting fired or indicted. Even his tweets (what he avows is his choice of communication with the American people) are filled with insults, attacks on his perceived enemies and excuses, lies and justifications for his own behavior. That\u2019s not communication\u2026.that\u2019s a cheap-ass apology tour.He WAS NOT ELECTED to enrich himself and his family and his friends, he was not elected to pick fights with our Allies and to find reasons to praise the World\u2019s dictators and enemies. He was not elected to give tax breaks to the wealthy while taking away protections from ordinary citizens. He was not elected to \u201cbe proud\u201d to shutdown our government and to try to blackmail Congress into funding a \u201cbig, beautiful, great wall\u201d (or even \u2018steel slats\u2019) INSTEAD OF FINDING AN ACCEPTABLE and workable way to allow normal channels of asylum for endangered immigrants and a path to citizenship for DACA young men and women who were following the rules set out for them and then had those \u2018rules\u2019 changed by DT. I sure won\u2019t make excuses for Donald Trump. It makes ME angry that DT is the way he is\u2026and I expect it makes a lot of other people angry too. American citizens deserve better in their president! ",

            "answer_text": "First, a disclaimer. This is MY opinion and everyone knows the saying about opinions. With that in mind, this is my answer to your question. Since Donald Trump has taken office, all we have heard is lies. We started hearing these lies during his campaign. He said he would release his tax returns and is still fighting that one in the courts. He said that he would build a wall (NOT a fence) on our southern border and have Mexico pay for it. We all knew that we would not be getting a check from the Mexican government. Many Trump supporters have said that the new USMCA trade agreement that replaced NAFTA is how we are getting paid. Most economists disagree with that perception. Now, a construction firm that has been repeatedly touted by Trump has gotten a contract to install 42 miles of border wall fencing that will cost taxpayers $30 million per mile. The budget office is investigating the bidding process on that one. Trump said his first priority would be a new healthcare reform bill to replace Obamacare. Even though the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress for the first two years Trump was in office, there was no healthcare bill. The Republicans could not come up with anything that would appeal to voters while protecting their buddies in the insurance industry. So, they abandoned work on the bill. Trump said that there would be an infrastructure repair bill that would create thousands of jobs. There has been no sign of that at all. Trump made overtures to North Korea to limit their nuclear ambitions. Just this week, foreign minister Ri Son Gwon stated, \u201cNever again will we provide the US chief executive with another package to be used for achievements without receiving any returns,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is more hypocritical than an empty promise.\u201d Another Trump failure on the international stage. Trump\u2019s cancellation of our agreement with Iran has led that country to restart and accelerate their nuclear weapons program. Still yet another Trump failure on the international stage that even brought the ire of some of our main allies. Trump and the Republicans gave a permanent tax cut to the wealthy while giving a pittance with a sunset clause to the middle and lower classes. Trump\u2019s never-ending tweets have made us a laughing stock to the entire world. His constant petty name-calling brings to mind a third-grader on the playground. No one on his staff seems to be able to control it and some even agree with it. That is a poor showing by our Executive branch in Washington. There are many more things that I could point out, but it would take too long. IMHO, Donald Trump and his ilk have put a stain on the United States that will take decades to erase. This time in our nation\u2019s history will be looked upon by scholars as the worst time ever even exceeding the McCarthy years. ",

            "answer_text": "A true leader has the comprehensive intelligence to see greatness where it exists and act on behalf of that already present greatness to fortify it by knowing where the weakness within its progression lies, and working in synergy with real present potential to manifest the next step of growth. Trump never looked up the word \u201cgreat\u201d in the dictionary. Nor does it apply to his severely lacking mentality, morality or person. When you do not know what the word truly means, you make up your own definition and protect it with what you call \u2018alternate facts\u2019. Therefore, since greatness has absolutely nothing to do with the likes or agenda of Donald Trump, please allow me to explain what is really going on here. The key word is INFECTION. \u201cInfection occurs when viruses, bacteria, or other microbes enter your body and begin to multiply. ... In response to infection, your immune system springs into action. White blood cells, antibodies, and other mechanisms go to work to rid your body of the foreign invader.\u201d Trump is as an infection that has entered the body of America. The only good he has managed so far is to activate response from our immune system, i.e. sane Americans who are strongly resisting Trump\u2019s toxic performance in the Oval Office. He has, unbeknownst to him, awakened a sleeping giant. America\u2019s immune system, i.e, those who do understand the greatness in this country already present, and who have worked to sustain hard won progress made in past decades, have been powerfully set into \u2018emotion\u2019 [sic] in this country. This conscientious tour de force are multiplying their efforts to slow the painful damage already in progress at the hand of Trump in a mere 100 days, as he smugly flips the bird to all that Americans have fought and died for. This \u2018immune system\u2019 is deeply committed, invoked by the sheer perversion of a Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Daily they work to rid America of this FOREIGN INVADER. For there is absolutely NOTHING American about Donald Trump, nor his entourage of psychos that hobble behind him trying not to bump into his engorged ego. Trump is a Foreign Invasion. As well, his biggest business deals are with foreign countries and all of his products are made in foreign countries. I think his hair was made in China. Who among us who had our heads filled through our entire childhoods with what it means to be an American can truly find it in our hearts, minds or conscience to look at this \u2026..man (I guess), and find anything that he represents to be in alignment with what we learned? What he is, is on the wrong side of history, and he represents all that we learned about that brought suffering and sorrow to a country newly developing. The words \u201cTrump\u201d and \u201cGreat\u201d together create an oxyMoron, with a capital M. ",

            "answer_text": "The United States is at a crossroads. Technological change is disrupting traditional work patterns, the baby boomers have entered retirement and are intent of protecting their privileged circumstances (if they are lucky enough to have them), inequality is the highest it\u2019s been since the gilded age. The list goes on. Negotiating these changes is never easy. Usually it takes a crisis before people put aside their personal interests and grievances and are prepared to unite to save the country by accepting the difficult choices that need to be made. Rather than do this, Donny Tantrum is riding the wave of anger and revulsion against the pace of these changes. He has a Svengali-like ability to harness these emotions and is surrounded by enablers all competing to try and catch this wave so that once Donny has left the building, they might be able to capitalize on this deep disaffection personally. Donny promised to Make America Great Again but all he\u2019s succeeded in doing is galvanizing his supporters in the electorate so that the nation is more divided than ever, successfully doing the very opposite of Lincoln\u2019s great \u2018a house divided against itself cannot stand\u2019 speech. Civil war is not out of the question. America\u2019s enemies are rejoicing at this weakness and see opportunities to challenge the global order. As a result, we are living in \u2018interesting times\u2019 with a rudderless Washington cast adrift just when enlightened leadership is most needed. So, no, Trump has not \u2018made America great again.\u2019 There is no strategy, only tactics, and these had weakened American democracy and threaten the stability of the whole planet. ",

            "answer_text": "Trump has not made America great as simple as that. However, I also don't think he meant he has a magic wand to return America to the manufacturing era in 4 or 8 years time. His whole philosophy is Americans should stop shipping jobs overseas. Americans should think of themselves first before other nations. Don't think black/white, straight/gay, major/minor ethnic groups but think collectively as Americans. Like we used to think when challenged by external forces in the past. That is not to say these divisions do not exist but they shouldn't be magnified as the most pressing issues because at the end of the day, the difference is between the rich and the poor and if there are jobs for all, we will all get along. He has started the revolution and as many populists, he will be misunderstood, attacked and ridiculed but should the country have republican presidents for another 16/20 years, Trump would be the one laughing. I don't think he saw the opposition to be this spread across from the DNC to a press that should do reporting not give opinions to celebrities and leaders of nations. The man is fighting on all sides. He didn't need to. He was already rich and famous before he became the president. Hence, he believed in what he wanted and is ready to go down for it. He will fight till he can't. That doesn't mean he hasn't had his shortcomings and mistakes but the opponents have sought ways to blow them out of proportions. I get it that this is politics but do most gullible masses out there do? They believe with all their hearts that there exists this existential evil in the White House that is worse than Hitler. In the end, in another 15/20 years from now, historians will separate the facts from the myths about the 45th president and history will judge if it was all worth it. ",

But here's the real answer to your question\u2026 America has not been truly great, ever. We began through conquest of an entire continent, committing genocide. We built our early country on the backs of slaves, and continued for the entire first half of our history. Then we began our imperialistic phase, destablizing governments, and toppling them to raise up our puppets. All the while, keeping non whites and women in the position of second grade citizens, and denying them the same basic rights that white men take for granted. We place profit above all else, and by every standard measured, we rank below virtually every other industrialized nation, in terms of health outcomes, education, percentage incarcerated, crime, corruption, etc. I dont want to \u201cMake America great again\u201d. I dont want to return us to an even worse time. I want to make America great for the first time. I want us to take care of our sick, take care of our disabled, our elderly. I want to ensure that every young adult begins their career with the education they need to be successful, without saddling themselves with an insurmountable debt. I want everyone to have shelter, and enough food. I want to eliminate the root causes of the senseless violence and hate that permeates our culture. I want us to stop building up and increasing the size of the largest standing military in the world, and begin withdrawing from the practice of trying to the puppet masters to the world. In short, I want America to be great, not just as seen through the rose colored lenses of our own hubris, but through the eyes of the world. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe President Trump is on a path to define again, for a country which seems to have forgotten, the baseline characteristics of what constitutes a nation. As I read through the answers on this thread, I certainly recognize the vitriol, hatred of the president and fairly outrageous theories regarding his intent regarding the office he holds. \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is a slogan any individual can dress for their own purposes, however I see in it an unusual simplicity of purpose. I believe President Trump is someone who wishes to leave a nation intact for his children\u2019s generation, and as a father of four I would tend to agree. Nations cannot exist without defined geographic boundaries, and those boundaries must be maintained, defended and universally recognized. When they are not, for instance now with the promised incursion of thousands, nations fail by definition. These are uncomfortable truths, yet truths nonetheless. We have substantial economic capability and a government which has failed these past three generations to learn how budgets function and why balance sheets matter. My issue in this regard is not whether President Trump has the ability to correct these matters on his own, but the absolute intent of millions to disallow some of the truths he brought to the office upon his arrival. While I recognize Donald Trump\u2019s imperfections as a person, I also recognize my own. So many who have decided President Trump is the worst American to have ever lived fail to revisit why he was elected, what this nation was attempting to accomplish at a difficult point in time. I do not wish to trade in the back and forth hatred evidenced on this thread. I find it impossible to look at fringe leadership of either party and see any possibility for finding fundamentals upon which the parties can agree. These are necessary for the nation to move forward rather than continue falling behind in any number of critical metrics. Debt, for one, will haunt us sooner than later. It is my firm belief President Trump is the best president for the nation, in his time, in my lifetime. I say that unequivocally, as I believe the statement is true and easily defensible. (For the record, I\u2019m 47). As a very moderate conservative with strong liberal leanings, we must remember gains made for civil rights regarding all races and sexual orientation need a concrete solid nation to protect them. I do not see the left capable of producing such a nation, however I do see a president working very hard to install responsible fundamentals to a nation which is missing them entirely. No matter the political winds of today, President Trump will be viewed historically as among the most wise and necessary leaders the nation has enjoyed. We are fortunate he is here in that office at this time, however it is quite likely few of his beliefs and intentions will be heeded. This will, with certainty, be at our peril. We will fail to follow the raw facts he is laying before the country, and in retrospect he will be among the most consequential men to have held the presidential office. As a direct answer, has he made America great again? The nation is great, beyond any slogan or propaganda. And President Trump knows this. I believe, as one of his voters who is not blind to his lesser qualities, that he is laying at the nation\u2019s feet a number of caveats our children will wish we had heeded. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on your point of view, as all things in politics does. If you support general deregulation (especially of the fossil fuel industry), heavy trade protectionism, tax cuts (though they mostly affected the upper echelons of tax payers), strong support for Israel, and much more aggressive immigration enforcement, then you could easily argue that the United States has become \u201cgreat again\u201d or better than it had been previously. On the other hand, if you support more business regulation, a more hospitable policy towards migrants, illegal and otherwise, as well as tax hikes for the upper echelons of our tax payers, you could argue that America has grown significantly worse than it had before. Now, if you\u2019re talking about how his presidency has affected day to day American life, the answer is also dependent on who\u2019s asking the question. For a large contingent of the American population, essentially nothing has changed under the Trump administration, except possibly altered tax rates. For the poorer part of America, things have gotten slightly worse. Tax cuts have had a limited impact on this income bracket, with many actually seeing higher tax rates than before. Prices of goods are rising or will rise as a result of the ongoing Trade War with China and the tensions with Iran. Drug prices are also continuing to rise and the healthcare situation of the poor is not at all in ideal shape. On the other hand, for the wealthier parts of America, life has improved to an extent. Taxes have dropped, business has been deregulated, the stock market is going great (though, it\u2019s very debatable how much, if any, the Trump administration has contributed to the market), and Trump\u2019s trade war has a limited affect on them. So in the end, it all ends up being based on your perspective. ",

Historically the United States has been a bastion of freedom\u2026this does not mean that everything is free. I remember my friends from SE Asia you're always asking me why America is a free country when everything was so expensive. I tried to explain the difference between being free as a person to do what you want within the limits of the law vs getting things for free. The United States has taken in more refugees than any other nation in history. People who are oppressed in their countries have been able to come to this country and join in with the Melting Pot that this country has been. Some folks like to call it a mixed salad instead of a Melting Pot because there are some who do not like to join the whole... But whether a person sticks out like a sore thumb or becomes Americanized, they will never be as bad off as they were in their own country. The problems we have with the borders have been going on for a couple of decades and Trump has decided to start enforcing the laws that are already on the books. This is a separate issue. When it is Posh for a democrat in the position of POTUS to start cracking down on the undocumented/illegal immigrants, the media seems to eat it up as if they are saving American jobs for the working class. When Reagan did his amnesty, of course you know who was against it. When Senator Obama was pushing for border control, no one complained. So now the current POTUS is cracking down on these things, because he opposed their darling Hillary, he is a racist. Think about it, every citizen who wants a job should not be supporting Sanctuary cities and open borders. Not only does that mean Less jobs, it also means there's less money for the welfare checks to go around. ",

            "answer_text": "It has become painfully certain that American people are being represented by Twitter posts. The entire world is looking at their phone and their phones are looking (and frequently spying) directly back at them. A well adjusted president would never have taken to Twitter to broadcast his message. Twitter is a goliath VIP watering hole where celebrities gather to check on their ratings. It should not be where the leader of the most dominant nation on earth accounts for himself or what his organisation is doing. Obviously America doesn't have a typical administration, or president for that matter, and trump, similar to the internet itself, seems to have no ethical quality, no standards, no core. Rather, similar to every other celebrity, he has a crowd of people thus he gives them what he thinks they want, subsequently these are unlimited mini-Nuremberg's looking for ratings, the only real currency he understands. Around the globe, we're seeing the appalling ascent of populist strongmen who lean toward dictatorship and public display over civility and to hell with democracy. Their usual way of doing things is the equivalent the world over, to steamroll each genuine and imaginary standard we thought we had. Envision your offspring never again having automatic citizenship whenever born in another nation. That law was passed on Oct. 29. The organisation reported, parents and guardians would need to apply for citizenship for their child. Twitter outrage ruled. By that evening it was a cacophony of wails and heartfelt protest that had become so uproarious USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli additionally took to \u2013 what else \u2013 Twitter to quiet the panic his own department had created. Incidentally, Cuccinelli is 'USCIS Acting Director' and not 'Chief' in light of the fact that nobody on this sinking boat of an organisation appears to keep their job sufficiently long enough to be delegated and acknowledge a full post. America is represented by big names and 'acting' chiefs. This is the world social media has created, where legislative issues has become another and possibly deadly form of entertainment, not governance. It won't end well. It's already a circus. The only thing to do is fire the clowns. ",

            "answer_text": "Because America was always \u201cGREAT!\u201d First of all, back in 2016 when Donald Trump was campaigning the Republican field was huge! He had demeaning names for his opponents. Each debate he performed poorly, I thought. Rumors of past indiscretions were making headlines. He shrugged. Everyone already knew he was a failed businessman. Between the numerous lawsuits, and the people who actually worked for him it was clear the stories were true. Meanwhile, Trump stayed the course. And all of the Republicans dropped out, one by one. DJT attacked Clinton's character. He attacked the Clinton administration. He attacked Clinton's marriage too! But Hillary never dignified the insults by fighting back. The Access Hollywood tape came out. Trump downplayed the comments. Polls indicated Clinton would win. However, even though Hillary Clinton did win the popular vote, and she had 3 million more votes than Trump, she still lost the election. In the United States, it is the electoral college that counts the most. This was affirmed by the Supreme Court in the 20th Century. Therefore, Donald Trump won the presidency. And, here we are almost 4 years later. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on who you are. The genius that came up with this slogan was smart not to define the time when America was great, or for whom it was great. Each of us has a greatest hits set of film clips in our head. While we know better, we can\u2019t help wishing for finer simpler times, just like in the movies. By not specifying a time or an objective, this slogan leaves audiences free to make their own interpretations. They are happy to do so, and this increases their support and motivation, because they can pick and choose their own version of the American Dream. \"Make America Great\" would be a worthy goal for a President. But AGAIN makes all the difference. It is a divide-and-conquer word added by someone clever enough to win hearts and sink knives simultaneously. \"Make America Great AGAIN\" had 3 main objectives: Insult and discredit everyone currently running the country (and not just liberals)Rally those left behind by globalization (think Glory Days by Springsteen) to get angry and start dreaming again.And comfort older people and those who fear change.So now to the report card. Objective 1 gets an A (extra credit via Twitter on a daily basis).Objective 2 is a solid B (only the Trump campaign understood that this group had legitimate issues that needed to be addressed - he is being blocked (with good reason), but he is trying to do what they want ).Objective 3 is a D- (the revolving doors and the scandals do not reassure seniors or conservative thinkers)It was a brilliant slogan to win the past election, but the result is now a slightly less great nation. Maybe the new national motto should be \u201cDivided we stand, united we fall.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Better than what\u2026the fires of Hell? Maybe. The economic prosperity trend was already happening; he has managed not to wreck that, but he didn\u2019t cause it. Look at any indicators going back to the Obama years. He is alienating our allies and cozying up to our former enemies, dangerous nations like North Korea and Russia. And he\u2019s doing it all for his OWN gain, not the country\u2019s. He has properties in Russia and seems to be interested in developing something in NK. Even his \u201cMuslim ban\u201d leaves off the most obvious country if you\u2019re using 9/11 as a guideline: Saudi Arabia, home of most of the 9/11 hijackers. Reason? Because he has real estate deals all over Saudi Arabia and isn\u2019t going to jeopardize his business. His tax breaks all went to his rich cronies and corporations, the only world he knows. And, they have skyrocketed the deficit which is now causing Congressional Republicans to rob Medicare and Social Security to pay for instead of just undoing the \u201ctax breaks\u201d that caused it in the first place. He was just about to start a war with Venezuela (he who never served a day in the military, nor has a single member of his family\u2026\u201dbone spurs\u201d indeed) until even his own appointees intervened. He is a loose cannon, akin to giving a 2-year-old a firecracker and a lighter. Eventually he\u2019s going to do something impulsive and we will all suffer. He spends taxpayer money to fly around and hold rallies for no real reason than to feed his own ego. He plays golf nearly every weekend, after criticising Obama for playing golf FAR less in his whole presidential span than Trump has already. And, he goes to his own golf courses, so the money while he plays\u2014taxpayer money mind you\u2014is going into HIS bank account. Why does nobody care about this?? ",

            "answer_text": "What is great. Certainly believers in fascism believed Italy was being made great with Mussolini same with Hitler. I\u2019m not suggesting Trump is either but you can see the definition of great is highly individualistic. Simply based on his comments it would be easy to see that racists, bigots and neo Nazis who yearn for the good old days in the south think Trump is on the right track. The flat earthers of the climate deniers persuasion certainly would think so along with the ripoff artists who want to see the removal of consumer protections from getting in the road of their sacred freedom to make as much money as possible. The evangelicals are happy to see the highest court packed with extreme right wingers and would certainly cheer it on. It will allow them to use government to impose their religious beliefs on others, establish religious privilege and give religion a privileged position in society . Then there are the gun lovers Trump hasn\u2019t even outlawed bumpstocks and has instead pushed the idea of armed teachers. Just think how those police in Aurora would be perfectly fine if the plant had a bunch of armed teachers to stop the killer. Then there is the FREEDOM bunch whose only wish to do whatever they feel like and ignore its effect on others. The only think that counts in their belief is how much money you have. Competition is sacred. Those with good medical plans can celebrate the fact they do not have to contribute others survivability. Certainly the wealthy can celebrate having tax cuts when the only permanent ones apply to them. To my knowledge Trump never claimed he would control the deficit and has in fact set massive debt rises in the future. Traditional anti government conservatives cheer deficits because it gives them excuses to cut social services. When Trump abuses women of boasts about there are some who cheer. In foreign affairs he declares victory when it doesn\u2019t exist in Syria and walk a away, similarly in Afghanistan. Again a glorious victory with North Korea when the only one who made concessions was the US. Believers of one sided American histories are happy when he bashes allies with lies and lauds criminal thugs like Putin. All to the good they will say. When he abuses Muslins and bashed refugees, all to the good many of his supporters say. Of course he does the approval good allies like Netanyahu despite the fact Israel has never done anything for the US or the Saudis the originators of Al Qaida and the financiers of ISIS. So for many people he actually has made America great again at least by their criteria. The minority that put him in power actually do think this behaviour is making the US great and putting things back to where they used to be.or at least the ones who pay attention. Of course according to a survey 40% of Trump supporters claim he has never lied so it is impossible to know what they think is great. Certainly you have to be oblivious to what's going on to believe that. Many won\u2019t care or even applaud the fact that the US can not claim it is the leader of the free world any longer. When at the Munich Security meeting when Pense stated Trumps international successes not one person clapped. When the Canceller of Germany spoke she received a standing long ovation. Based on the above you can see what their idea of greatness is. It\u2019s not mine but I\u2019m not an American. ",

            "answer_text": "Has Trump made America great again? No, he has demolished America\u2019s greatness. I cannot say it better than Fintan O\u2019Toole said it in the Irish Times:. https://www.irishtimes.com/\u2026/fintan-o-toole-donald-trump-ha\u2026 Fintan O\u2019Toole: Donald Trump has destroyed the country he promised to make great againThe world has loved, hated and envied the US, Now, for the first time, we pity itSat, Apr 25, 2020, 06:00Fintan O'Toole Over more than two centuries, the United States has stirred a very wide range of feelings in the rest of the world: love and hatred, fear and hope, envy and contempt, awe and anger. But there is one emotion that has never been directed towards the US until now: pity. However bad things are for most other rich democracies, it is hard not to feel sorry for Americans. Most of them did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016. Yet they are locked down with a malignant narcissist who, instead of protecting his people from Covid-19, has amplified its lethality. The country Trump promised to make great again has never in its history seemed so pitiful. Will American prestige ever recover from this shameful episode? The US went into the coronavirus crisis with immense advantages: precious weeks of warning about what was coming, the world\u2019s best concentration of medical and scientific expertise, effectively limitless financial resources, a military complex with stunning logistical capacity and most of the world\u2019s leading technology corporations. Yet it managed to make itself the global epicenter of the pandemic. As the American writer George Packer puts it in the current edition of the Atlantic, \u201cThe United States reacted ... like Pakistan or Belarus \u2013 like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.\u201d It is one thing to be powerless in the face of a natural disaster, quite another to watch vast power being squandered in real time \u2013 willfully, malevolently, vindictively. It is one thing for governments to fail (as, in one degree or another, most governments did), quite another to watch a ruler and his supporters actively spread a deadly virus. Trump, his party and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News became vectors of the pestilence. The grotesque spectacle of the president openly inciting people (some of them armed) to take to the streets to oppose the restrictions that save lives is the manifestation of a political death wish. What are supposed to be daily briefings on the crisis, demonstrative of national unity in the face of a shared challenge, have been used by Trump merely to sow confusion and division. They provide a recurring horror show in which all the neuroses that haunt the American subconscious dance naked on live TV. If the plague is a test, its ruling political nexus ensured that the US would fail it at a terrible cost in human lives. In the process, the idea of the US as the world\u2019s leading nation \u2013 an idea that has shaped the past century \u2013 has all but evaporated. Other than the Trump impersonator Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, who is now looking to the US as the exemplar of anything other than what not to do? How many people in D\u00fcsseldorf or Dublin are wishing they lived in Detroit or Dallas? It is hard to remember now but, even in 2017, when Trump took office, the conventional wisdom in the US was that the Republican Party and the broader framework of US political institutions would prevent him from doing too much damage. This was always a delusion, but the pandemic has exposed it in the most savage ways. Abject surrender What used to be called mainstream conservatism has not absorbed Trump \u2013 he has absorbed it. Almost the entire right-wing half of American politics has surrendered abjectly to him. It has sacrificed on the altar of wanton stupidity the most basic ideas of responsibility, care and even safety. Thus, even at the very end of March, 15 Republican governors had failed to order people to stay at home or to close non-essential businesses. In Alabama, for example, it was not until April 3rd that governor Kay Ivey finally issued a stay-at-home order. In Florida, the state with the highest concentration of elderly people with underlying conditions, governor Ron DeSantis, a Trump mini-me, kept the beach resorts open to students traveling from all over the US for spring break parties. Even on April 1st, when he issued restrictions, DeSantis exempted religious services and \u201crecreational activities\u201d. Georgia governor Brian Kemp, when he finally issued a stay-at-home order on April 1st, explained: \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that [the virus can be spread by people without symptoms] until the last 24 hours.\u201d This is not mere ignorance \u2013 it is deliberate and homicidal stupidity. There is, as the demonstrations this week in US cities have shown, plenty of political mileage in denying the reality of the pandemic. It is fuelled by Fox News and far-right internet sites, and it reaps for these politicians millions of dollars in donations, mostly (in an ugly irony) from older people who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus. It draws on a concoction of conspiracy theories, hatred of science, paranoia about the \u201cdeep state\u201d and religious providentialism (God will protect the good folks) that is now very deeply infused in the mindset of the American right. Trump embodies and enacts this mindset, but he did not invent it. The US response to the coronavirus crisis has been paralysed by a contradiction that the Republicans have inserted into the heart of US democracy. On the one hand, they want to control all the levers of governmental power. On the other they have created a popular base by playing on the notion that government is innately evil and must not be trusted. The contradiction was made manifest in two of Trump\u2019s statements on the pandemic: on the one hand that he has \u201ctotal authority\u201d, and on the other that \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all\u201d. Caught between authoritarian and anarchic impulses, he is incapable of coherence. Fertile ground But this is not just Donald Trump. The crisis has shown definitively that Trump\u2019s presidency is not an aberration. It has grown on soil long prepared to receive it. The monstrous blossoming of misrule has structure and purpose and strategy behind it. There are very powerful interests who demand \u201cfreedom\u201d in order to do as they like with the environment, society and the economy. They have infused a very large part of American culture with the belief that \u201cfreedom\u201d is literally more important than life. My freedom to own assault weapons trumps your right not to get shot at school. Now, my freedom to go to the barber (\u201cI Need a Haircut\u201d read one banner this week in St Paul, Minnesota) trumps your need to avoid infection. Usually when this kind of outlandish idiocy is displaying itself, there is the comforting thought that, if things were really serious, it would all stop. People would sober up. Instead, a large part of the US has hit the bottle even harder. And the president, his party and their media allies keep supplying the drinks. There has been no moment of truth, no shock of realisation that the antics have to end. No one of any substance on the US right has stepped in to say: get a grip, people are dying here. That is the mark of how deep the trouble is for the US \u2013 it is not just that Trump has treated the crisis merely as a way to feed tribal hatreds but that this behaviour has become normalised. When the freak show is live on TV every evening, and the star is boasting about his ratings, it is not really a freak show any more. For a very large and solid bloc of Americans, it is reality. And this will get worse before it gets better. Trump has at least eight more months in power. In his inaugural address in 2017, he evoked \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d and promised to make it stop. But now that the real carnage has arrived, he is revelling in it. He is in his element. As things get worse, he will pump more hatred and falsehood, more death-wish defiance of reason and decency, into the groundwater. If a new administration succeeds him in 2021, it will have to clean up the toxic dump he leaves behind. If he is re-elected, toxicity will have become the lifeblood of American politics. Either way, it will be a long time before the rest of the world can imagine America being great again. ",

Trump from day one has been destroying the American fabrics of life, culture and all- peice by peice,day by day-there is no decency left, everything is a lie, the press is now our enemy!. You know that one of the first things dictators hate is a free press. Even the White House Melinials lie about their jobs so they can get a date since people don\u2019t want to deal with them once they find out they are connected to Trump, and they say they got their idea out of Trump\u2019s playbook. That really makes America great for the first time, not just AGAIN! Doesn\u2019t it? America is on a very wrong path to nowhere, and we need to make a U-Turn asap, so please vote in November and stop this nightmare, America deserves better!! ",

There is a thinly veiled thought of distrust from the people that used to be our allies. The world watches as his cabinet carpools in a clown car every morning to figure out how to fuck the American people out of their hard earned cash. Trump hires only yes men. These incompetent nincompoops are more than willing to invoke any stupid idea Trump has. Laws? If the president does it isn\u2019t illegal. Trump further proves he wants to be dictator by trying to limit free speech and freedom of the press. He has an inherent disdain for people that don\u2019t say nice things about him. Even though he finds it extremely to do that for others. He uses other tyrannical leaders methods, such as calling names and using epithets to encourage his followers and suppress any dissent against him. He deflects every crisis on Obama and the Deep State. He encourages conspiracy theories that he finds out about on the internet and allows them to pack his brain, instead of running the country. There is much, much more. My arthritic fingers are starting to ache. You an fact check it for yourself. This is how Trump has Made America Great in the eyes of the world. Not so much here either. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely . . . he is the first President in my lifetime ( 72 years ) who has spoken without prevarication regarding his policies and carried them through ( example: moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem ). I believe he will be re-elected in 2020 for four major reasons: 1.) He is politically beholden to no one and addresses issues in a frank and forceful way by addressing basic issues important to the greater American public. I think one of the reasons he has been so viciously vilified by the press and the main stream media is because he threatens the patently corrupt \u201c business as usual \u201c Washington establishment which has its invested interests in continuing the flow of money to politicians and lobbyists whose sole concern is not for implementing rational, common sense policies beneficial to the people and nation of America, but rather for manipulating the American public with the purpose of cynically supporting established policies instituted by politicians for financial gain and to ensure their personal political futures. Uncontrollable political mavericks like Trump are anathema to the corrupt politicians in Washington because he doesn\u2019t play by the \u201c rules \u201c. 2.) A sure indication of his popularity among grass roots Americans and the threat he poses to the \u201c establishment \u201c are the transparently false and increasingly outrageous and hysterical accusations leveled by the liberal Democrats against him using \u201c trigger \u201c terms like \u201c racist \u201c, \u201c white supremacist \u201c or \u201cHitler \u201c, as well as the Democrats tacit support of violence by Antifa, the mob mentality of the Democrats we saw during the Kavenaugh hearings, the personal threats to his life, the threats and physical intimidation of conservative supporters on high school and college campuses. etc. all in response to policies unfavorable to \u201c liberal \u2018 Democrats. 3.) When we see the openly hostile and personal attacks on the man rather than addressing the issues in open debates and the obscene statements by such individuals like Bill Maher who recently said he hopes for national recession in order to injure Trump . . .Maher is willing for all Americans to suffer financially just to unseat Trump. This is also a revelation of the Democrats unhinged mentality within the Hollywood community where people who make their living by playing characters in imaginary worlds feel their opinions that carry more weight than the opinions of ordinary hard working Americans. This borders on clinically unbalanced megalomania. Another aspect of the \u201c Hollywood psychosis \u201c where \u201c liberals \u201c who rabidly advocate against the 2nd Amendment regularly portray violent characters using guns on the big screen. Some of the most highly vocal and virulent anti-Trump members of the Hollywood community such as Robert De Niro have made their fortunes portraying violent, gun wielding criminals. The absolute unparalleled example of the psychotic mentality of Hollywood is the recently touted film \u201c The Hunt \u2018 where rabidly anti- 2nd Amendment liberal actors portray rich individuals who hunt and kill conservatives for sport. 4.) Trump is serving UNPAID in the position of President of the United States. That alone shows me the strength, honesty and dedication of this man in his love for America. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Trump has succeeded in making America Great for those who are extremely wealthy. He reduced the amount of taxes that their corporation and what they personally have to pay. AND these people are now even wealthier than ever with money that they do not need or have use for. In return, he increased taxes for the rest of the American by increasing tariffs on the goods that they have to purchase. He also destroyed the livelihood of farmers leaving many of them bankrupt. He destroyed whatever little universal health care Americans have so that poorer or middle class American can die if they are sick. In the world, when Trump wanted to hold a G7 summit in June, none of the other countries would attend. Alone only amongst one or two other countries, the US could not provide a national coordinated strategy to control coronavirus AND as a result over 100,000 Americans have to die and many more will in the coming days. He systematically paralyzed critical International institutions like the WTO and WHO, and walked away from treaties keeping the United States and the world safe. Those who had supported Trump now have to asked themselves a difficult question - Did they make possible the leadership of a man from a dark fiery place, a man who had promised those who follow him greatness, who inflicted havoc and chaos on the United States and the world, who caused tens of thousands of needless deaths in his country, AND had critically damaged International Institutions and led the foundation of a future conflict especially with China that will end with armageddon - just as a book revered by many had prophesied.

            "answer_text": "America is better under Trump. There are numerous new jobs, and many, many people who\u2019ve been unable to find employment for years, are now very gainfully employed. Unemployment rates for women and minorities are at the lowest levels ever recorded. Businesses are making increased profits, and are therefore increasing distributions to share holders, and giving raises, and bonuses to their employees. Fewer people are taking benefits payments from the state. There are a record number of new businesses opening and many are small businesses, with minority owners. These are all great achievements for the people benefiting from them, and they look to be likely to continue. What concerns me, and what makes me worried for my country, is the large number of Democrats who went off the (psychological) deep end after the 2016 election and have never come back. We saw riots; the destruction of personal property, and the beating of an innocent person the mob decided voted for Trump. We\u2019ve seen Antifa, self admitted leftists in disguise, who beat innocent watchers at protests. And we\u2019ve seen normal people absolutely come apart as they saw a member of the President's cabinet at a restaurant and literally screamed her out; actually, versions of that have happened several times. The reason I\u2019m concerned this time, because of course the left is very emotional and feeling oriented compared to the right, is that most of this rage isn\u2019t connected to any rational issue; so your candidate lost, pretty common phenomenon in a democracy, right? And, that it doesn\u2019t seem to have abated over time. Oh, I\u2019m sure that some enactors went home and resumed jobs or studying, but their replacements are just all about OUTRAGE! Which isn\u2019t a healthy way to live, or to participate in politics. I worry for these people, and I\u2019m worried about these people. ",

Trump has turned lying into a national (and Fox \u201cNews\u201d) past time. He has given a voice to the most hateful groups in America, including white supremacists, Nazis and everything in between. Worse, his words have spurred some to violence, as is evidenced by the shooting in El Paso, TX this weekend, where the shooter mimicked Trump\u2019s own words about \u201cinvading Hispanics.\u201d Trump\u2019s trade wars are putting America\u2019s farmers out of business and raising prices on imports across the board. Contrary to what Trump says, tariffs are paid by importers and passed on to consumers. That\u2019s us, the American businessman and taxpayer. Because of his backing by the NRA, Trump continues to stonewall on any attempt to create sensible gun laws. Trump knows absolutely nothing about health care (or anything else) and has made it only worse since taking office. Rolling back everything President Obama accomplished, in his first month in office, Trump made it legal for coal companies to dump toxic waste into clean rivers and for the mentally ill to buy guns. Are you better off since Trump took office?   ",

America was already GREAT before Trump, and hopefully, will still be great once he\u2019s impeached, arrested, tried and convicted for his many crimes - unless he dies and goes to Hell first. Before you right wing nuts start attacking me, go look at the cold, hard facts (I know, I\u2019m asking you to read) about Manafort, Cohen, Flynn, and others flipping on him. If there is nothing \u2018there\u2019, then why the fear of \u2018flipping\u2019? You can ONLY FLIP ON A GUILTY MAN!!!!!! Let the truth out, and the courts decide. The truth is, Trump knows what he did; not just in the campaign, but before and since. From treating his foundation like his personal piggy bank, to paying off porn stars to win an election, to obstruction of justice, to LYING 7 TIMES A DAY, he is the MOST CORRUPT president in history. No one like that makes anything great - they only lie to brainwashed masses that repeat the lies, desperate to prove to themselves and the world they made the right decision voting for him.

            "answer_text": "No , and it is not his goal either . His vision for our country is to make it a great environment for the very rich to grow even richer , and that is his main reason for decimating the environment , for promoting greater dependence on oil and coal , for ending regulations on banks that were put in place so that the country would not endure a repeat of the financial disasters of the George Bush Jr. years . An example for the utter disdain that Trump has for American citizen\u2019s health was when the Trump administration turned over the ban on the use of lead ( a known carcinogen ) in the hunting and fishing industry ( for weights in fishing lures , and buckshot in ammunition ) . The ban on those uses of lead was enacted during the Obama years , and to the common good of American citizen\u2019s health . Was reintroducing lead into our waterways and forests part of making America great again ? No , and like every good thing that the Obama administration did , Trump will try to tear it all down , because his racist voting base will never get over that which is abhorrent to them - that we had a black president - and Trump\u2019s admirers froth at the mouth when they see news of Obama era regulations quashed by Trump . Getting them to the polls , and enablement for the wealthy to grow richer - both are , in Trump\u2019s mind , what will make America great again . One way that America was striving to be great , was that during the Obama years , we joined the rest of the developed nations of the world in offering National Healthcare availability to those of us whose employment does not offer health insurance . The well-being and safety of the citizenry is a president\u2019s top responsibility and priority . This current president seems to act in direct opposition of those essential goals of a president . He tried feverishly to end our health care program . He has not acted to end the unfathomable availability of assault rifles , nor stop guns from being sold at shows , online or between private parties . He has not assured our citizen\u2019s safety , when persons who have exhibited signs that they may be dangerous individuals ( such as threatening behavior , restraining orders , membership in hate groups , records of mental illness ) , are still allowed to purchase guns . This president has put our national security at risk , both with denigrating the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. , and his associations with our enemies . The final flaw in any notion that Trump could have an effect on making America great again , is that our leaders should be examples to us all . In a country growing more violent , one of Trump\u2019s solutions was to tell police that it was o.k. to rough up arrested persons during the drive to the police station . Lying , scheming with our enemies , encouraging violence , no consideration towards solving climate change - the negatives of this man as our leader sometimes seem endless . Therefore , the question of whether Trump can make America great again , is surely posed in jest . This is not someone that decent and patriotic citizens could emulate or look to with confidence as to our future . ",

            "answer_text": "You make the common mistake of assuming that there are quick, major changes in the country when the country changes Presidents. It doesn\u2019t work that way. Economists don\u2019t even agree on how long the previous President\u2019s economic policies affect the economy. Some Obama-supporting economists were trying to claim that the economic boom and low unemployment rates that the country was experiencing just before the COVID-19 pandemic were the results of Obama policies. The biggest immediate change when a new President takes the oath of office is a change in general attitude and outlook of that President\u2019s supporters. Actual change takes much longer, and in President Trump\u2019s case, even longer as just about every policy he tried to implement was the subject of numerous lawsuits. Occasionally a President gets one of his major agenda items passed. We are still muddling through the clusterfuck that is Obamacare. Trump was able to get a major tax cut passed and people are still arguing about who benefits from it. This is generally a stupid argument because to benefit from a cut in Federal Income Tax, you have to actually pay the tax and the bottom half of the country doesn\u2019t pay Federal Income Tax! The biggest changes that happen are the appointment of judges to the federal courts and the Supreme Court. These changes take time to propagate through the system. It has taken decades for activist judges to really screw up the country and it will take decades for originalist judges to unscrew things. In the meantime, President Trump can reverse Obama\u2019s executive orders, which may improve the lives of many people. He is also working on reversing destructive federal policies and eliminating excessive federal regulations. These can also have dramatic improvements on individuals and businesses. For most people a change in President has little direct effect on their lives. It still takes Congress to pass laws and State laws are generally unaffected by who sits in the Oval Office. Up until COVID-19, I would have said that Trump\u2019s America is about 10 to 15% greater than Obama\u2019s America. Most of that improvement comes just from not having to listen to Obama telling us that \u201cthat is not who we are\u201d. America\u2019s greatness does not come from the government or its President, but from its people. As long as people have the freedoms guaranteed in our Constitution, the country will remain great. We are still the country where people use their ingenuity, their imagination and their hard work to improve their lives, often improving the lives of others along with theirs. We are still the country where any child can aspire and possibly succeed in becoming a doctor, an astronaut or even President. ",

            "answer_text": "Rump has done nothing but damage our country - horribly. Rump\u2019s priority is not the US, it is himself. He wants to stuff his wallet full from any and everything he can get out of his position. Why the senate republicans have done NOTHING to stop him - who knows! This sends a very strong signal that any republican senator that comes up for election this year or next year need to be cancelled out. THEY ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOBS! 100 senators to represent our population of over 327 million people in our country. They HAVE to work for the people they represent. Rump deserves NO credit for our country\u2019s economy. He was fortunate that he inherited this economy. Rump has hated Obama and can not stand the idea of a black man being the president. Now, Hillary is saying Obama should be reelected. I thought Obama was good for our country. He took the worst recession since the Great Depression and turned it around. I didn\u2019t like everything but I would take him again over rump any day. Our debt has skyrocketed and in this great economy, not a single dollar has been paid toward that debt. He runs the country\u2019s money the way he runs his own money - 6 bankruptcies and he didn\u2019t learn anything from them. Rump also has / is working to undo everything Obama did. Right after the election he wanted to get rid of Obamacare. It was a huge surprise to him and republicans that the \u2018people\u2019 did not want to see it stopped. Pulling out of the Iran agreement was so f**king stupid. There was not a problem with Iran adhering to that agreement. Obama signed the agreement for the US so rump had to get rid of it and look at the problems now. He pulled America out of the Paris Accord and is doing so much to damage our country\u2019s environment and the world\u2019s. He has done so many things against the environment that he keeps under wrap. An example of this (that is not being kept under wrap) is the disgusting lawsuits he started against California and 4 car manufacturers that refused to raise their carbon emissions like rump wanted. California has stricter This is his \u2018punishment\u2019 to them. Rump publicly trashed these \u201cpolitically correct Automobile Companies\u201d that are resisting his efforts to let them produce more gas-guzzling vehicles. Ford Motor Co., Honda, BMW and Volkswagen announced a voluntary agreement with California this summer to meet the state's air pollution goals despite the Trump administration's proposal to freeze fuel efficiency standards at their current level. These suits are rump\u2019s \u2018punishment\u2019 to these companies because they didn\u2019t do what he wanted. The companies agreed to voluntarily increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, essentially ignoring the Trump administration\u2019s plans to roll back car pollution standards. State officials have been trying to persuade other companies to join the agreement; the White House has been trying to prevent that. EPA??? We no longer have one. The head of the EPA is a former coal lobbyist and doesn\u2019t believe in climate change. Rump is opening up so much of our country that is protected to gas and oil drilling - fossil fuels. Rump has no grasp that this IS a very serious issue for people and that people will pay extra if it will help clean and keep our environment healthy. We can not lose another 4 years to the idiot! Rump has done so much damage to our allies and has openly praised dictators. I am certain from my research that he did use Russia\u2019s help in 2016. His fat ass SHOULD NOT even be in the Oval Office. His fat ass needs to be in prison and if the federal government does not do it, New York will. The lies, Lies and MORE LIES. You can\u2019t believe a single thing that comes out of mouth. These are DANGEROUS!!! Why is he saying there is an agreement with Japan now and Japan has said that nothing is signed and is not sure that they are ready to sign. Why did rump say that Melania and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un are getting close and they\u2019ve never even met. Big and small, he lies about it all. It is easy to see why so many books have been written about him and his administration. He was going to \u2018drain the swamp\u2019 and \u2018have the best people.\u2019 The swamp is overflowing and overflowing with people who have no f**king idea what they are doing. 9 members of his resorts and \u2018bigly\u2019 have been given upper level positions in his administration. Betsy Devos is the Head of the Department of Education. Qualifications: 0 and it shows!!! She is so bad at the job, but she was a big donor to rump. My heart was lifted today when when I saw rump\u2019s approval rating down to 38%. A large poll was done asking if rump deserved to be elected again - a resounding NO by 60% of Americans. I do believe rump is his own worst enemy. His one slogan he\u2019s sloshing out there is that if he is not elected again, the stock market will crash. We are no longer a respected country. Rump is not respected by any world leader. He is an embarrassment to America and we, the people, do not look too good for putting him in office. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't live in the United States. My answer will therefore be that of a European who has a necessarily different vision of a person living in the United States.  From my point of view, Donald Trump has weakened the United States internationally by opening the door wide to China. The United States had for decades been the world's policeman. All countries turned to the United States whenever they had a problem. More and more countries are turning to China now. By opting for a US strategy of turning inward, Donald Trump is opening the door to China's rise to global prominence. Domestically, I have the feeling that Donald Trump has only served to divide a country that was already extremely divided. He is only stirring up tensions. The expression divide and conquer seems to have been coined for Donald Trump. The good economic figures for the United States at the beginning of 2020 were just window dressing. Donald Trump's short-sighted approach paid off, but in the medium term it makes the US weaker. The coronavirus crisis that erupted finally confirmed what everyone suspected: Donald Trump does not embody the leadership that the US needs in difficult times. The Donald Trump experiment is a failure in my opinion, and it did not make the United States great again, in fact the opposite is true. ",

She points to the stock market, unemployment, Christmas sales and other economic indicators as proof that \u201cTrump has moved America to be great again\u201d. This has been the mantra of Trump supporters in the absence any other positive accomplishments. It is much like saying a person has pearly white teeth while they are dying of cancer. While there is a difference of opinion whether the economy is the result of Trump\u2019s actions or a continuation of Obama\u2019s, it is all transactional. To me, the presidency must also be inspirational, and in this, Trump has failed miserably. A president should inspire people to be their best; Trump seems to relish in inspiring people to be their worst. No, I cannot say that Trump has moved America to be great again. He is moved America to the lowest common denominator: one of greed, corruption and racial bigotry. He has forfeited America\u2019s position as a moral leader with his isolationist foreign policy. He has sold the presidency to the highest bidder and has blackmailed at least one foreign leader to do his political bidding. In 2016, nearly everyone in the word believed that America WAS great, and, after three years of the Trump Presidency, America is no longer great, and we need a president who WILL make America Great AGAIN, and that is certainly NOT Donald J. Trump. ",

Behind all his loudmouth boasting about things that very often have nothing to do with him, with all his whipping up his base into a frenzy, he is quietly, evilly dismantling this country; the environment, our educational systems, social programs (Kelly Ann\u2019s comments about Roe V Wade yesterday made me just want to throw up). His comments on veterans, immigrants and minorities are sickening and show exactly the core of the person who holds the pen. This is a disaster, and simply pointing to the economy as a golden indicator of how great we are doing is deceptive and dangerous. ",

He is appointing incompetent rich people to important posts, while not filling the many necessary posts that actually do the work of the departments, because HE DOESN\u2019T BELIEVE IN THE WORK OF THESE DEPARTMENTS. He is not a lawyer, nor has he ever held office, so he has no concept of the functions of government. He has no experience in diplomacy, so he has no concept of international relations. Even his business experience is inadequate. He was the emperor of his own little business, where he did not have to get along with anyone else. Never mind his cheating, fraud, and bankruptcies! (I can\u2019t believe I just wrote that sentence.) I have more business experience than he has, since I have worked in many different kinds of corporations, utilities, and non-profits as a consultant. Worst of all, he has no concept of greatness, to make America great, never mind again. He thinks that keeping the bombastic promises of his campaign is a goal. He is incapable of learning, lazy beyond belief, and entirely self-indulgent. He is simply using the office to increase his wealth and the wealth of his co-conspirators. This is the Empire of Grift. We will be great again, as we were a couple of years ago, once we get rid of this den of thieves. It will take hard work to clean out the sludge, though. ",

The Donald openly lies without giving a damn. It\u2019s not his fault people just let him get away with it. The Donald has tested American democracy and it has failed. The constitution is just a bunch of words, unless you\u2019re willing enforce it. And they\u2019ve failed. The Donald is doing us a favor, he\u2019s a parasite. A disease that will either kill us or make us stronger. Let the Trump supporters feel the burn of the Donald. Don\u2019t stop his policies let them play out. At the end of his term Bush poll numbers were in the teens, and as result the people voted for Obama. Things should go horribly wrong, I want it to get worse. Trump should break even more laws until his yes-men come to their senses. ",

Don\u2019t be fooled by people telling you how great the economy is. Many experts say within 12\u201320 months we will be in a serious recession. tRump is also costing poor Americans a fortune with his new tariffs that he claims we won\u2019t have to pay. Oh no, that is simply a lie. L-I-E. They already said they are passing it on to us and wholesalers say they are passing it right on down to the consumer. YOU will pay for his tariffs now that everything is affected. Make America great\u2014-just a rehashing of what Reagan/Bush ran on 20 some years ago. That was their slogan. So Republicans thought it was bad then too? These people just arent happy with anything. They have gone a bit off the deep end and all I can say to them is good bye. ",

This message is about hypnosis, and this message isn\u2019t about hypnosis, because politics doesn\u2019t exist, only hypnosis does, and because hypnosis doesn\u2019t exist, only hypnosis does. Donald Trump has demonstrated to all America the power of hypnosis. Whether you agree with him or not, Whether you love him or hate him, we all have learned a lesson about human nature, human communication. Whether it be Obama, Roosevelt, Reagan, or now Trump, these leaders are capable of connecting with the emotions of their listeners and inspiring them to action that engages them even deeper in that new reality. Each of their fan bases believe that its because Obama is smart, because Roosevelt was fair, Reagan was courageous, or Trump is _______ . If we\u2019re not part of their fan base we may even think they and their fans are completely off. This proves that communication isn\u2019t about logic or information. Indeed, even human life is not about logic or information. It\u2019s about experience. It\u2019s about emotion. The one you\u2019re feeling right now. Let\u2019s amplify it, in the way you know how. It\u2019s about self hypnosis. Each of these communicators knew how to connect with their audiences and speak directly to their inner needs, guide them in self hypnosis. All great leaders are master communicators, master hypnotists. If you have insight into this subject, not the politics of politics, but the politics of power, please write me, it would be my honor to exchange and even work with you, so contact me, work with me, learn hypnosis with me, email me or message me and see how doing that affects your learning, because everything is hypnosis, even right now. Donald Trump has taught America the art of hypnosis. But we don\u2019t need to think about him anymore, or talk about him anymore, because right now, you are teaching yourself. ",

They apparently did not understand that South America is not a part of Mexico and people from the South American continent were not Mexicans. This person was very angry at Mexico for not doing everything in its power to keep the asylum seekers off US soil and in the Mexican territory. I did them that courtesy after they called me as ass for a comment I made which was neither challenging nor combative or argumentative. The only people that think America magically transformed into \u201cTrumps greatness\u201d from \u201cObama\u2019s failure\u201d, are the same ones who think Mexico and Mexicans are synonymous terms with South America and South Americans. Though there are some that support Trump on a realistic level, agreeing with his general stances but recognizing that he hasn\u2019t actually accomplished many things of benefit at this point that were not already in the bag from Obama era policies.

He falls in love with dictators, cages babies, reversed a trend where 140,000 more Hispanics were leaving than coming in, when Obama left, to now where 100,000\u2019s more are coming in, he has undone everything Obama and other Presidents have done to combat Climate Change, help the environment, and protect endangered species; and is so racist that hate groups have doubled under his watch, and domestic terrorism is so great the FBI now rates it a greater threat to us than Isis and other foreign terrorism.

The economy is in tatters and the fed is printing money at insane levels trying to keep it all afloat. The national debt is rising like a rocket. And tens of thousands of overwhelmingly peaceful protesters are filling the streets where they are dominated by heavily militarized police and national guardsmen. But hey, he\u2019s closed down all LEGAL immigration and appointed a bunch of young, hard right, judges. So I guess, for Trump followers, it all evens out in the end and while maybe not yet \u2018tired of winning\u2019, they think America has returned to greatness.

All Trump needs to do is to conduct a successful PR campaign that would result in majority of US population feeling good about themselves and their country. It is quite an achievable task. All that, in essence, needs to be done is to make the Progressives to shut up about the problems this country has amid a growing employment and the incomes that should be brought by it. That is what Trump is trying to do by writing off Environmental Issues, while Income Inequality will be taken care of naturally once the better paying jobs become available due to the economy upswing that Trump may have nothing to do with, but will readily take a credit for. What else is left on Problem List? Student debt? He will get some Government Cash to the kids to alleviate their money problems a little. And a little later. I am sure at some point he will throw some bone to minorities in order to fulfill his promise to them. What is important when dealing with minorities is to make them feel superior to Illegal Immigrants, which is under way right now. The problem is that GOP provides no help to Trump not only because a lot of members object his concept presented above, but rather because his own party has never been able to govern, forcing President to babysit Congress that Trump should have had in his pocket long ago. Instead of help they are just a drag. That may actually make Trump to fail, not the media that is merely controlled by his political enemies. Thank you for A2A. ",

Now the most often quoted claim that Trump made America great again is the ridiculous claim that he saved the economy. The truth is that Obama inherited an economy that was swirling down the toilet. He turned it around and by the end of his presidency handed over an economy that was seeing an unprecedented period of growth. A new president will ride whatever wave they inherit for the first couple of years. Trump might take credit for continuing or even building on that growth and I might buy it. But he neither saved the country, nor the economy. I also have to ask if the economy is the only thing we are supposed to value? What about racial tension, what about all of the apparent illegal acts being conducted to keep Trump in office? What about mishandling a pandemic that brought said wonderful economy to it\u2019s knees? What benefit if you gain heaven but lose your soul? ",

When you become an elected Head of State, you are responsible not only for the interest of those causes that you can relate to, but you\u2019re responsible for those in which you find disagreeable.

Of the thousands of examples we see every day, I will mention the gutting of most regulatory agencies. Cutting regulations allows large corporations to make greater profit because they can more cheaply dispose of toxic by products\u2014not in rich neighborhoods, but in poor ones. Numerous studies have linked the effects of air pollution to negative health impacts including asthma. EPA's website states Particulate Matter Pollution is linked to premature death in people with heart or lung disease, irregular heartbeats and decreased lung function. However, the Trump administration has moved to rollback a number of environmental regulations linked to decreasing air pollution and particulate matter in the air including changes to the Clean Air Act and the Clean Power Plan. In March, a key environmental justice leader at EPA, who helped found the agency's environmental justice office during the early 1990s, resigned amid the White House's budget proposal to dismantle such programs. In October, the EPA formally proposed scrapping the monumental Obama-era CPP, which aimed to reduce emissions from the power sector. At the end of January this year, the administration announced it would be ending a key part of the Clean Air Act known as the \"once-in always-in\" policy, which regulated major sources of hazardous air pollutants. Under the agency's new interpretation of the law, coal-fired plants were downgraded to \"area sources.\" EPA scientists find black communities disproportionately hit by pollution It\u2019s not supposed to work that way in a democracy. We\u2019re supposed to be represented, not exploited. America used to be greater for all of us. Now it\u2019s great for some but rotten for most. Get out and vote.

Are you a poor or middle class person who thinks that when the rich get richer it will eventually make you richer somehow? See the previous answer.

They are what they are at least in part. because of forces that started before he was elected. We will have to wait to see how things play out while he is President. The other problem with a slogan like MAGA is since the USA is such a large country geographically, what is good in one area is bad in another. People in Ohio may like it that immigration from Mexico is down, but people in Texas don\u2019t. A reduction of immigration means Texas loses jobs. People from Ohio aren\u2019t coming down here to work so we have industries that depend on immigrant labor and without that labor, we lose jobs. So, I will say it depends on your point of view and what you think MAGA means. For me, I am going to say no, he is not making America great. ",

Most voters and those who are just into partisan politics rarely see past the present, but the fact is that Trump basically inherited an economy strongly on the rebound from the measures Obama and his administration put in place to heal the economy after the devastation they inherited from G.W., which in turn had its roots in some of the well-meant changes made by Clinton to the banking sector to help low income earners buy homes. The \u2018miraculous\u2019 tax benefits Trump brought in haven\u2019t done much for the middle and lower classes, the main beneficiaries have been the major corporations in the country, benefits that will help Trump\u2019s own businesses in the long run, well after he\u2019s left office. His war against China has only served to hurt American businesses and consumers due to the increased prices of products coming in from China that have been heavily hit by the levies. The whole point to using countries like China for production was the cheap labour, which therefore becomes somewhat pointless if you\u2019re going to heavily tax the goods in a tit-for-tat exchange because the exercise in essence creates a trade imbalance as a natural consequence. You can\u2019t have one without the other, but Trump in essence wants to use a latter day form of gunboat diplomacy to try and even the playing field. ",

Trump can adopt executive orders which are to implement the laws adopted by Congress and Trump has used executive orders to repeal much of what Obama did by executive order. I think Trump has basically kept to his campaign promises in that he has done all that he could do on these issues without Congressional support. It must also be remembers that Trump is really an Independent president as the Republicans really don't like him either. ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously making anything great is subjective. What I would consider great you may consider mediocre. Make America Great Again was a slogan to help contain his idea on what needs to happen in this country. It's the same thing Obama did. He used a phrase we could all get behind. He promised change, you know what he's best known for? Pushing a bill through for nationalized health insurance that had been proposed for years and years. Now we call it Obamacare and a bunch of people don't enjoy it. The only thing he effectively changed was the insurance industry by giving health insurance to the poor while making it harder for the middle class to afford it. We don't pay for healthcare only through taxes now but through higher premiums and copays. And if you don't want to have insurance you can give the government your money to help with the free health care already offered. So, what Trump considers great is a country that is taken more seriously, has more freedom, and less government. How is he doing? He's working on it, he hasn't even been in office for a full year yet and you're asking where this great America is? Look in the mirror, our greatness doesn't come from politians, legislations, rules or laws but from you and me. Everyday, everything we do, does it reflect the values we want others to respect or our children to follow? If it does then you're doing your part to make America Great, your own way, no matter how subjective that greatness may be. It's still a freedom we are entitled to at the moment. Enjoy it. Rock it. Don't waste it. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not know what great really means so it is hard to say. I am assuming that this is hearkening back to the 1950s and 1960s when America had a standard of living that was the envy of the rest of the world. When Trump took office we were barely in the top 20 for quality of life in comparison to other countries. That has not gotten better. In the 1960s 50% of the wealth of the U.S. was in the hands of the middle class. Many say that is what made America great. Today it is about 5%. That has not gotten better. The tax cut for the rich made this worse. It has been the policies of the Republican Party that have created the disparity of wealth and income that we are experiencing. This was by design. Those policies if anything have intensified under Trump as he does not really have any specific plans of his own. This void has been filled by the Neocons so far\u2026.neocon healthcare plan\u2026neocon tax cut. One definition of this is to bring back a style of work where a person could graduate from High School, get a job at the local factory, work his entire life, save and make good decisions and have a home and a very nice quality of life with a good retirement. There are problems with this. As much as people want to hear that Trump is going to bring this back, this is gone forever. The U.S. manufactures as much as it did in 1984. It does so with one third of the people employed as in 1984. Automation is not going away. The nature of work has changed. The skill sets needed are different. Anyone who says they can turn back the clock on this is lying. It may be what you want to hear, but it is not true. ",

It is intended to elicit positive feelings from its intended audience. Each word is important. \u201cMake\u201d is an imperative verb. It signals immediacy of action. \u201cAmerica\u201d is a proper noun. It evokes the feeling of being home and the abstract ideas of freedom, prosperity, or whatever other positive aspects the audience desires. \u201cGreat\u201d is an indefinite comparative informal adverb. It lets the audience define what it is that is better than something else. Importantly, it is imprecise and indefinite. \u201cAgain\u201d is an indefinite adverb. It lets the audience define a tomorrow that is compared to an undefined and imprecise past. Together the phrase elicits essentially meaningless, but warm feelings of nostalgia for an fluid past within its intended audience. Edward Bernays describes slogans such as this as engineering consent, \"use of an engineering approach\u2014that is, action based only on thorough knowledge of the situation and on the application of scientific principles and tried practices to the task of getting people to support ideas and programs.\" This is an example of propaganda.

If you are not rich, not much has changed, other than increasing anxiety you might lose some support systems, such as health care. Trump has increased employment but there really is no metric for quality employment, other than real wages, which haven\u2019t changed in this country since the late 60s. The majority of the population is usually forgotten or left behind by the various administrations which populate the White House. And I don\u2019t see any change coming from White House in regard to America\u2019s constant \u201csaber rattling\u201d and imperialistic nature, so I\u2019m inclined to say not even in the slightest is America suddenly great.

(Harley Davidson, Carrier, etc..)Our president routinely ignores the urgent recommendations of the FBI, CIA, NSA and Homeland Security to not do business with ZTE. This Chinese company has already been caught committing espionage against our country, but our president is worried about \u201cChinese workers losing their jobs\u201d. His decision to support them was shortly thereafter followed by a major contract with China for his companies, and 13 trademarks for his daughters companies.Instead of being transparent about his companies and their ties to Russia, he is fighting disclosure using layers upon layers of lawyers to obfuscate the facts.",

One measure of that greatness is how many people are desperate to come here and stay. By the way, how many people are desperate to leave? That is not to say we don\u2019t have serious problems that need to be resolved. The ding in our greatness is that our elected political leaders are more interested in protecting their political fortunes than solving those problems and the level of our political discourse has sunk to a new low\u2014 on both sides To answer the question, I believe Trump has had the opposite effect of making us great again. He has embarrassed us on the world stage by pulling out of carefully negotiated international agreements supported, with virtual unanimity, by our allies\u2014Paris Climate Accords, Iran Nuclear Agreement and TPP. He has insulted our allies and cozied up to murderous dictators\u2014Kim, Putin, even Duterte\u2014 and has pursued foreign policies that can only be described as erratic and irrational. His ridiculous Tweets have demonstrated his preteen temperment and betrayed his lack of even a casual acquaintance with the truth. While he has done a couple of worthwhile things\u2014Neil Gorsuch\u2019s appointment for one\u2014all in all I believe he has lessened our standing in the world. ",

He foolishly held a rally while COVID-19 is still active in many states with no regard for his followers' health. Then he complained when only a few thousand showed up, did he really think 1 million people would gather in one place to hear the same old stories and lies. He has ruined the economy, severed most ties with our allies some who respected us for over 200 years.

            "answer_text": "America was doing a good job of being great before President Trump entered the Oval Office. However, what he has done is ensure Americans are not embarrassed to be proud of being American. I support America and its ideals so perhaps I am not the best person to answer this question as I also support President Trump - not on everything. He has a way to go on Climate Change but he is gradually moving his position. Has he made America great again as in have his policies made a difference? Well he has tried very hard to promote Peace and he has not been afraid to take bold economic steps. Where he has excelled is in the background - which of course the media never report - well at least the Australian Media do not report. He meets and he deals with and for all those many hundreds of thousands of groups who are the backbone - \u2018the fraternity of America\u2019. He enacts laws and he tells the people what he thinks. We need that. We need a President who is not afraid to say \u2018how he sees it\u2019. We all know more about the direction of America\u2019s philosophy now than with any other recent President(s). We know where America is going and how it intends to do it - and that is thanks to President Trump. Here in Australia it is the opposite. We have no idea where we are going and being great does not appear to be an option - It should be but it is not. ",

I would posit to the masses that we have yet to achieve greatness. We have been close, but currently we are about as far away as we can be. We are no longer a beacon of what is right and just, and this is tearing us apart from the inside out. Until we can be great to each other, we cannot be great in the eyes of the world. ",

If you ask the Right, he\u2019s well on his way to making America great again. If you ask the \u2018centrists\u2019/Middle, he\u2019s still a mixed bag, although the economy\u2019s booming, which makes most of the negatives about Trump superficial by comparison. If one asks the rest of the world\u2026 who cares what the rest of the world thinks about America moving toward being great again? It\u2019s in the best interest of many developed countries if we\u2019re brought down to a level playing field with them, so America moving toward being \u2018great again\u2019 will be seen in a negative light by a lot of the world. Except Israel and probably the U.K. Personally, I think Trump has moved a lot of Americans toward feeling more self-confident and proud of being American than many of those on the Left are willing to admit. So in that way, he has moved America to be great again. Has he been a great president? No\u2026 at least not yet. Time will tell. ",

He is divisive, he prefers to \u201ctear apart\u201d by making people \u201cus against them\u201d. He prefers to \u201cgive\u201d to those who can or have \u201cgiven\u201d to him in the form of tax breaks or jobs that those people are not qualified for, and who, in fact, do more damage than good. (by design?) He has done significant damage to the relationships we had with our allies. He has raised the national debt to heights never seen before and that will take more years to \u201cfix\u201d than I have to live. He has the mistaken belief that calling bankruptcy is a \u201cfix all\u201d. After all, he\u2019s done it several times with his own businesses, so he\u2019s set a precedent. I believe, that to make the US great, the government needs to significantly invest in repairing our infrastructure (which would increase jobs). I personally believe we need to go to a single payer health care module and remove the profit out of health care. I think the tax structure needs to be reset so those who make more pay more. I think that state owned colleges should be non profit (even free to those who live in that state and can make and keep up the grades) I believe that any company claiming something to be \u201cnews\u201d should be mandated to be honest, give the facts without spin, and give the positives and the consequences of the item being discussed.

            "answer_text": "Short answer: NO. Donald Trump, aided by Republicans who have worked to roll back, or paralyze, government reforms, for at least the past 24 years; and I could go back further than that, given time to do the research, dismantling every piece of reform legislation and Law passed in over a hundred years. Take, for example, the fight over Obamacare, and also look at the genesis of Obamacare, in Romneycare, and HeritageFoundationcare. Also, look at the attempt to come up with a plan by the Clinton Administration in the mid-1990's, which was dropped after stiff opposition from the Republicans, and the medical insurance industry (see, \u201cHarry and Louise\" commercials). I would also suggest reading books, like \u201cBush's Brain\", about Karl Rove, and the campaign to get George W. Bush into the White House; along with \u201cThe Acting President\u201d, by Bob Schieffer and Gary Paul Gates, and \u201cThe Man Who Sold The World\u201d, by William Kleinknecnt; both about Ronald Reagan, and how a \u201cB Picture\" Actor, whose star was fading in Hollywood; was packaged and sold to the American Public, first as a spokesman for General Electric, then as being fit for the Governor's Office in Sacramento, and finally, for the Oval Office in Washington, D.C., and what happened after he got there; it may help you understand how America got where it is. I suspect something similar happened in Britain, with Margaret Thatcher. ",

            "answer_text": "Every great era of American history has its own sense of why America was great. Abraham Lincoln instilled in most Americans (at least those living in states that did not secede) that the nation\u2019s strength and security was inextricably linked to the preservation of the Union in which every American played an important role. Teddy Roosevelt inspired everyday Americans to believe they were part of a United States that was emerging as a world leader in diplomacy, security, opportunity, trade, and innovation. His cousin, FDR, convinced Americans that collectively they could work their way out of the Great Depression and later he led America and the free world in defeating the Nazi threat. Similarly, Harry Truman established American greatness as a protector of democratic ideals and world security. Jack Kennedy set Americans on a course believing the nation could conquer any challenge, even space travel. Through his gifted rhetoric, Ronald Reagan made America feel great not only because of its military strength and diplomatic stature but because it stood as a beacon of freedom and a better life to American born and immigrants alike. Similarly, through his soaring speeches Barack Obama expanded our nation\u2019s promise to all Americans, regardless of class, race or gender. What is the common theme? During the times described above, many Americans believed America was great and they, as Americans, were important because their president inspired those beliefs. That brings us to Donald Trump who boasts that only he can make America great. He not only boasts that he alone holds the keys to the nation\u2019s greatness but he manages that way also. He ignores the advice of his advisers and rejects the counsel of his counselors. Most importantly, and unlike every great American president mentioned above, Trump does not inspire Americans to believe in their own greatness. To the contrary, he pits Americans against one another dividing us by gender, race, religion, ethnicity and economic status. So, Trump will never make America great because he doesn\u2019t inspire most Americans to believe their nation is great or that they are an important part of this nation\u2019s greatness. Like other demagogues before him, Trump preaches that he alone can make the rest of us great. That has never worked before and it won\u2019t work now. ",

In his first three years, Trump has increased deficit spending $350 billion over Obama\u2019s last four years. At this rate, Trump will have increased the nation\u2019s debt over 4 Trillion in his first term. That may be lower than Obama\u2019s $5 trillion first term, but as we all know, Obama was dealing with one of our nation\u2019s worst recessions. Trump has no excuse! He promised annual GDP of 4% to 6%, but hasn\u2019t topped 3%. In fact, his annual GDP isn\u2019t substantially different from Obama\u2019s second term. His \u201ceasy to win\u201d trade wars have forced many small farmers into bankruptcy and have cost taxpayers $billions.

When the economy crashes late next year or in early 2021, many more will wake up and understand the damage that can be caused when someone as unfit as Trump is elected. The election of Donald Trump has cost America dearly, but as a result, many people are now motivated to undo the damage he as done, and make America great again. ",

It's really a slogan designed to appeal to his older, more conservative, whiter demographic. It promises to return to some idealized golden age, whatever that was. Trump\u2019s problem is that he has a superficial grasp of what the government is supposed to do and how it works. He is finding it to be much more difficult than running his companies. Trump is way out of his element, and seems not to enjoy the nuts and bolts of governing. He seems comfortable only in front of adulatory crowds on a reprise of his campaign. Trump already shows signs of exasperation and fatigue. He is fairly quickly becoming a conventional conservative, as he is accepting the reality that our system is not designed for quick change, much less change that will \u201cspin our heads.\u201d Trump campaigned as a transformative figure for a nation that yearned for transformation. He sold aspirations without any idea how to deliver them. Trump will lurch from crisis to crisis while being advised by fiscal conservatives, neo-cons, and Wall Street bankers. There will be no transformation. There will be no greatness. The best we can hope for is not too much damage. ",

I\u2019m from Australia and I didn't even know who Steven Colbert was before the stolen election. Many Americans who were previously unengaged in politics have taken part in protests, town hall meetings and some have even run for local office. The tragedy of Russia\u2019s successful attack on US Democracy has created a culture of awareness and activism. People in America are learning that the price of freedom is constant vigilance. As dark and depressing as this new Oligarch/Kleptocrat has made life in the US, there is a silver lining. That silver lining is the art of rebellion. People in America now have never really been more connected to their nation\u2019s brave founders who fought Autocratic oppression to create a Republic. Arguably, this fight against the self important, unqualified sponges in charge will have a far better outcome than the War of Independence because there is nobody remotely as sane or respectable in the Whitehouse as Crazy King George, but there are people who can sue the Trump gang for there misdeeds when this is over. America is a strong country, even if it's horribly divided. It may not come out of this mess as strong as it was by comparison to other countries, but it's people will be far stronger and wiser. ",

As I never tire of saying, when he passes Tump-care that covers everyone with better coverage and lower costs to consumers, that will do a lot to boost his image. Currently, he is allowing Paul Ryan to try to toss out millions from their medical coverage while worsening the coverage of many others. If Ryan succeeds, that will not be good for the Donald. ",

The illegal immigrants are the victims, more often than not killed and raped by Cartel members and police in their journeys through Mexico. This trafficking is promoted by the Cartels, who have members even in India who promise the moon to these poor immigrants who have a rude awakening when they show up in Mexico. I have a friend in the Border Patrol who told me last month he apprehended a mother and son from India who payed $30,000 to a Mexican cartel and traveled all the way from Mumbai only to be robbed in Mexico and dumped in the brush on the other side of the Rio Grande. Trump is the ONLY American who is dedicated to ending this vicious trafficking. It will only be brought to an end when the public of the world gets it through their heads that they will not be permitted entry at the border. The border is closed. On trade, Trump is navigating troubled waters, for the first time bucking the Chinese and EU, which have been taking Americans to the cleaners for decades. It\u2019s a mess and is disrupting established winners and losers in the trade regime which has existed for the last twenty years. However Trump is correct in pointing out that he\u2019s not inaugerating trade war, he\u2019s merely retaliating for a war which the US has been losing now for decades. With a 700 billion dollar trade deficit how could it possibly be any worse!!! ",

The fact that 50% of the country believes a certain path forward should be different than the other half of the country is a demonstration of tolerance and greatness on all sides. So, my perspective is that Trump is an example of how great our political process is. Whatever he or any past or future president contributes to that is fine with me. ",

I give him a 50% chance of continuing down this path and becoming America\u2019s Mussolini. There is also a 50% chance that the middle third of the electorate will decide that they must pay more attention to the people they elect to represent them. They may even devote as much time to politics, issues, and sorting out real from fake news as they spend on their fantasy baseball team. If that happens, we will be rescued from the brink and return to the greatness we had as recently as 2008 (when our presidential choices were Obama and McCain). ",

Low impact unless a controversial War is ongoing, which it isn\u2019t. Healthcare? Matters, but less so if you now have a better paying job with health cover. Environment? Not an issue for most people most of the time. So, according to most economic reports, most people are better off, including most traditionally deprived ethnic groupings. Low unemployment, high employment, rising wages, better benefits including healthcare and crucially all this at the lower ages end as well. How much of this is due to Trump? That\u2019s a big debating point. But it\u2019s all on his watch so right or wrong he gets the credit. If that continues, the rational vote is for the status quo and on current numbers most incumbents would be looking at a landslide re-election. Emotion might get in the way, many people don\u2019t like Trump, don\u2019t like his actions and behavior, but bottom line is most people don\u2019t vote emotionally they vote rationally. So Opinion Polls will reflect the emotional great dislike for Trump, but if those numbers continue, rationalities will drive votes and he will win. if those numbers continue, it\u2019s still an if.

Irish people see themselves as being more than just an ally to America, but closer to family. What we\u2019ve seen is America giving up it\u2019s role on the global stage, this is a role they worked hard to achieve, America\u2019s reputation globally is now in the gutter, it\u2019s actively breaking all it\u2019s relationships and losing it\u2019s standing in the global community. I can appreciate America took on a lot of responsibility in the world, and maybe the rest of us didn\u2019t do as much as we could have, but America is going to lose out as much as any of the rest of us. America is used to being the head honcho, now it\u2019s the guy standing outside being ignored. Without that global economy America will lose out. It\u2019s always been at the head of the table, able to set policy and reap the rewards, but Trump is eroding that status, handing it to China.

He will use POTUS to his own full benefit regardless if it hurts others in the process. That\u2019s a key characteristic of those who suffer NPD.

We don\u2019t frequently have ineffective leaders, but when we do, it doesn\u2019t hurt much of anything. Our economic and political systems have an inertia that our elected leaders can either add momentum to or maybe leach a little from. Americans might not have a lot of faith in our elected leadership, but we do have an unshakable faith in the ability for our system to drive ultimately-good outcomes regardless. Problems will be noticed and fixed, not left to fester and grow. Trump\u2019s election provoked a national conversation about sexism and we\u2019re better off for it. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really, Iran\u2019s regime is still out there. Islamic Republic of Iran goes on to finance terrorism and terrorist groups over the next ten to twenty years. It seems that the regime of the Iranian ayatollahs uses terrorism to survive the dictatorial system that has been created in Iran. Another reason to finance terrorism is to buy time\u060c Why do they need to by time? Yes, of course, for the production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and more advanced ICBM. Looking at the economic situation inside Iran, it can easily be concluded that improving the livelihoods of the Iranian people is not at the top priorities of Iran's ayatollah regime. They (The regime of the Ayatollahs) completely abandoned Iraniran people from their economic calculations. Therefore, it can be concluded that the regime of the Ayatollahs in Iran has had an undeclared war. Why undeclared war? Because they want to achieve their strategic goals silently. They do not want to provoke the United States, for a military strike against Iran (This is one of the key goals of the Iranian regime).They want to build nuclear weapons and missiles, like North Korea, And given the bad economic conditions that have been created in Iran, it can be concluded that they are very close to their goal, if they have not already reached it.Both the Obama administration and the Trump administration were wrong to replace diplomacy with war, the only possible solution to the problems that the Iranian regime has created, was the war. The diplomatic approaches towards a regime that launches a terrorist group every week is pretty much like a jok, which is not funny at all. So, in the next decade, the Iranian regime will achieve its goals, or the United States will stop them, And the era of dialogue, diplomacy and negotiation with the Iranian regime has come to an end. Iran has a richly talented population, and rich Persian culture. But instead of unleashing both and enabling Iran\u2019s youth to realize their full potential \u2014 and making the country influential that way \u2014 the ayatollahs are suppressing those talents at home and unleashing the power of Shiite mercenaries on Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen, and compelling influence that way instead.
