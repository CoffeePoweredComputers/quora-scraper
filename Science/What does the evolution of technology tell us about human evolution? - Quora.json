            "answer_text": "I believe that the evolution of technology gives us an incredibly exciting perspective of how humans are evolving. In my mind, I see technology bridging the gap that has formed between physical limitations and our immense creative power as a species.We are using technologies to move our physical selves into a future that our bodies can no longer adapt at a fast enough pace to keep up with. For example, if I want to breathe under water to do deep sea exploring, I have many forms of diving technologies that push us far past what we have evolved to be able to do. Space travel is another example; we are not designed through evolution to be able to survive in space. However, our minds and creativity have given us the ability to create whatever tools become necessary to achieve the incredible goals that we set out for ourselves.This has led to an explosive growth in our capabilities. In evolutionary terms, (if you include what we are able to achieve with our minds) we are now evolving at an exponential rate. This type of evolution happens on many bio levels, such as the bacterium realm. If bacteria evolve a new method of travel, or consumption, you find a massive amount of new growth with new variations because of the sheer numbers of reproduction. I do not like comparing us to bacteria, but the fractal analogy is there to a degree for those who think of systems in a fractal pattern. Our technology is just the material equivalent of the expansion of our creative evolution. Our minds and our creativity are part of the evolution process, and I think it is as beautiful as any creatures colours or physical features.Ultimately, I think that the evolution of technology tells us that we are evolving at an accelerated pace that has the potential to keep moving at an exponential rate. Look to the future. It's pretty awesome if you think about how fast we are moving right now. ",

Some obscure genius discovers a solution to determining latitude and for 40 years London aristocrats try to steal it from him.Read a book on great inventions ,and we now know that most were somebody else's idea, and some clever businessman exploited it.
