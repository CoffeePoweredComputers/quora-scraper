            "answer_text": "So you are asking for example if two pairs of neutron stars happened to collide at almost the same time could their gravitational pulses cancel each other? I think they would superimpose and add if they were close enough in time. I don\u2019t get the idea that these are actually waves but are more like pulses which momentarily stretch space in a direction orthogonal to the path and shrink it along the path of travel. if It were a wave you would see some oscillations both along the direction of travel and perpendicular to it. Now there may be more than one pulse. There may be a pulse train. There may be a stream of pulses but, for example, along the path of travel the density of space will never be stretched and perpendicular to the path of travel space will never shrink below its norm. A string of pulses could look sinusoidal. It\u2019s just that the axis of the sine wave would be at 50% of the rms value of the wave. When the gravitational distortion reaches us it shows up as a shortening along its path and a lengthening perpendicular to its path. so if another wave came in perpendicular to the first and arrived at exactly the same time and the arms of your interferometer just happened to be aligned one with the first and two with the second then the two waves would cancel eachother out. But if the second arm was perpendicular to the second wave then the contraction along the first arm would cancel but the expansion along the second arm would double. This assumes that both waves have exactly the same amplitude. Of course the probability of this happening in the real world is virtually zero. Anyway that\u2019s my understanding of this. Feedback welcomed. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly. Where and how do you control masses that large? Say, the LIGO detected a gravity wave caused by combining two black holes totaling 66 solar-masses. A Solar-Mass refers to the mass of our(tiny) Sun, in cosmological terms. How to collect, guide, and manage such a mass? And timing would be a little problem to solve, yes? This is like playing marbles, a child\u2019s game with black holes, or neutron stars\u2026 ",
