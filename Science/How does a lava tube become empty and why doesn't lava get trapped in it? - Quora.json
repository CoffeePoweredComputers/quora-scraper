            "answer_text": "First off, that\u2019s why it\u2019s a Lava tube . If lava got trapped in it (say, the end got blocked), the lava inside would slowly harden and the tube wouldn\u2019t be a tube anymore. This does happen. But I think you are more interested in how such a feature comes to exist in the first place. There are several ways to form a lava tube, but here is the one that is easiest to explain: Lava tends to flow in channels. Fresh hot lava flows faster than cooler sludgier lava. As lava on the edges of a channel loses heat to the surrounding cooler rock, it slows down, while the insulated hot lava in the middle of the channel flows faster. The heat of the lava can gradually melt the rocks below it, deepening the channel with time. At the same time, the lava on top is being cooled a little bit by the air. Along the edges of the channel, slower lava becomes more viscous, and doesn\u2019t mix as well with the faster flowing hotter portion of the channel. So the part of the edge that is also at the top and exposed to air loses heat even faster, and doesn\u2019t mix back in with the hotter part of the flow. Eventually, it stiffens and accretes to the surrounding, cooler rock. Over time it continues to cool and solidify, forming levees along the edge of the channel, and eventually the top of the lava channel crusts over. Now the most interesting part: Rock is an insulator. The tube doesn\u2019t conduct heat away from the lava as efficiently as the open channel did. So the flowing lava stays hotter inside the tube than it would have in an open channel. That keeps the lava less viscous, and makes it flow more easily, allowing it to mix more within the channel (so the edges don\u2019t cool down as fast because they are constantly getting mixed back in). By keeping the lava hot, the tube is self-maintaining because hot lava doesn\u2019t clump and solidify. As long as there is a supply of fresh hot lava from the vent, and a place for the lava to empty out at the end, the tube will continue to be a tube. If the end gets blocked, the crust at the surface of the tube is often weak enough that the pressure of the flowing lava will break through it somewhere and provide another outlet, allowing most of the tube to continue acting as a conduit for the lava.

            "answer_text": "Oh, lava gets trapped inside of lava tubes all the time. Then it\u2019s just called basalt rock. Obnoxious as that joke is, it\u2019s true. Here\u2019s how lava tubes actually form, though. In lava flows, the material along the sides of a flow move the slowest with the fastest lava flowing in the center of the channel. It\u2019s exactly the same as a river, just liquid rock instead of liquid water.  From the diagram above (pretending it\u2019s lava instead of water) we\u2019re looking at A. The slow stuff at the margins is also the material most exposed to heat loss, either to the cool ground surface or to the air. The stuff in the middle is the most insulated and stays hotter longer. Along the edges, levees are formed. The slow moving fast-cooling margins of the lava flow harden to rock and act to constrain the lava flow channel. The levees are not all that dissimilar to levees for a river either.  Again, we\u2019re talking lava instead of water, levees of basalt rather than silt and the mechanism by which they\u2019re created is different, but structurally they\u2019re virtually the same. Once those levees are built, the lava flow is much better insulated except that now its main outlet for heat loss is through the top of the flow. Crust begins to form at the top, floating along and congealing together. Bits of crust stick to each other and stick to the levee walls. Eventually, you end up with roof being constructed and an insulated tube with fluid lava flowing within it. This insulation will keep the lava within hotter and allow it to flow greater distances before hardening to rock. Now, if for some reason the lava gets stopped up inside of it, which is common if the lava is slow-moving, then you\u2019ll just get a basalt rock without much special inside. If the eruption ends or changes upstream, allowing the contents of the tube to empty downstream without replenishment, you will be left with a hollow tube. And voila! Below is not the greatest diagram nor the best (nor most accurate) description, but it might help you visualize what\u2019s happening.  ",
