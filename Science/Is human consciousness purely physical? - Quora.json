            "answer_text": "No, human consciousness is not purely physical. We know this because the contents of conscious experience are not physical. For instance, mathematics is not a physical phenomena but rather an idea phenomena. For consciousness to occur, two things must happen simultaneously. Physical phenomena and non-physical phenomena must co-occur. the physical organism must instantiate non-physical representations. Things like color, sound, smell, and other qualia and also thoughts, ideas, meanings must exist and be instantiated in some kind of physical form. Put another way, organisms that embody representations with their nervous systems are conscious. Representations are the content of experience. without representations there can be no experiences, and hence no consciousness. without physical processes that instantiate representations there can be no awareness, and no experiences - and hence no consciousness. For someone to argue that consciousness is purely physical requires they demonstrate how the contents of consciousness, things like the square root of -1 are physical phenomena, as well as things like the color magenta, or fear, or danceability in music. let alone things like errors, empty sets, illusions, or regrets. None of these are physical phenomena, but they are phenomena. We live in a universe that is made of particles and most of the local particles are in the form of molecules; that is the physical part of the universe. But we also live in a universe with ideas, concepts, meanings, feelings, and qualia; that is the non-physical part of the universe. This non-physical part is representational. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes consciousness is entirely caused by physical processes. Physical processes are the only type of causes that can be understood scientifically. However, physical processes can be used to model and represent various abstract ideas, such as a center of gravity, which could be defined as being non-physical. So it all depends on how you define the terms physical and non-physical. (However please don\u2019t define your terms as Calvin Tolman does because its preferable to avoid contradictory concepts when possible). Consider a flag after image (after staring at inverted colors). The after image appears to be out there on the white screen you are now staring at. We can say the after image is not physical because it is not where it seems to be. The physical cause is not out there where it seems to be. However, we can also say that the after image is indeed physical because it is generated by physical processes in the brain. So for an intuitive answer, its ok to imagine that sometimes things are real and non-physical. However, for a more rigorous understanding, it always comes down to some physical cause. That\u2019s why the full and proper answer is \u201cyes, consciousness is caused by pure physical processes\u201d (the same goes for qualia). Here is where Calvin goes off track : \u201cthe physical organism must instantiate non-physical representations.\u201d That\u2019s wrong! Instead the physical organisms represent non-physical concepts,ideas and sensations, but the representations themselves are physical. Here is where Calvin gets it right ! \u201cwithout physical processes that instantiate representations there can be no awareness, and no experiences - and hence no consciousness.\u201d Good! We agree! Calvin says : \u201cBut we also live in a universe with ideas, concepts, meanings, feelings, and qualia; that is the non-physical part of the universe\u201d I\u2019m willing to accept that claim (as I hinted above). Just remember that these \u201cnon-physical part of the universe\u201d are caused by physical representations in the brain. Likewise numbers and mathematics are also caused by physical representations whether it be symbols written on paper or beads on an abacus or brain processes. Without any physical representation the operations on the numbers cannot be performed. If the numbers are not able to accomplish their operations (and properties such as identity) then they are not numbers. Hence they depend on the physical representations. ",

            "answer_text": "Re-posting a comment I wrote for Hacker News. It's easy to demonstrate that consciousness is matter. Put a bullet through someone's brain and that person will cease to be conscious. What is difficult to demonstrate is if that is all there is to it. For this we can turn to math. Do the intricacies of the rules of mathematics actually exist anywhere? Obviously not, unless you consider words and symbols written in books to qualify. Math exists everywhere, because you can use it to describe the physical, and it exists nowhere, because there is no literal physical representation of it anywhere. But we can actually build physical representations of particular math equations, inputting them as programs into a computer. The representations obey the rules of mathematics, as well as the rules of the physical world, if you destroy the computer, you also destroy the operation of the program. But yet there is more to these programs than meets the eye physically. There are hidden rules that they operate by, more than just the physical affects them. These are the rules of math. We can analyze the programs using various mathematical techniques and prove things regarding them. It is the same way with consciousness. We only see the physical affects because that's what we're looking for. We don't see the countless hidden rules that also affect consciousness. They are so numerous and manifold that they look wholly continuous with the physical world and physical rules. What are these rules? In a word, they are ideas. Ideas have logic to them and can be compared with other ideas. We can say that one course of action is good or bad, when compared to other courses of action. Ideas and thoughts themselves are so comparable to computer programs that it's amazing to me that we programmers scoff at the idea of thinking machines. You analyze thoughts with other thoughts, with tools of logic. You analyze computer programs with the rules of math, many times those rules are implemented with other computer programs. The question, \"what is consciousness,\" is purely the domain of philosophy. Biology and physics can only takes us so far in our quest to understand ourselves. To attempt to do so would be like trying to analyze a running computer system by smashing it apart and looking at the silicon under a microscope. It fundamentally mistakes what a computer program is. And knowing that it is just electrical signals traveling across transistor gates doesn't get you very far either. Even analyzing the voltage levels across the entire running system isn't going to tell you much either. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea that there is \u201csomething\u201d beyond the physica, electrochemical processes of the brain is essentially a religious one. Religiously oriented people desperately want some sort of survival of physical death to fuel their notions of afterlives or reincarnation. Alas, there is no evidence whatever of an such \u201csomething\u201d. Whereas there is plenty of evidence to indicate that the function of the brain is directly responsible for consciousness\u2026That consciousness is an \u201cemergent property\u201d of these processes. We observe many things\u2026 That trauma to specific areas of the brain causes observable and direct effects on consciousness. Indeed, much of our knowledge of what does what in the brain is by the study of trauma and damage. Further, when we stimulate the brain with electrodes, we can elicit specific memories or sensations at particular locations. If we introduce chemical, we can elicit observable and predictable effects\u2026. Alls seeming to indicate that consiousness is a property of the brain\u2019s function rather than some strange outside force which has never been observed. ",

            "answer_text": "John Searle has the best answer to this question in my opinion. He insists that consciousness is an emergent property of interacting neurons in the same way wetness is an emergent property of interacting water molecules and solidity is an emergent property of particles in a rigid lattice. Where the analogy breaks down is the fact that wetness and solidity are objectively verifiable whereas consciousness is entirely subjective. So if we consider wetness and solidity as physical, as I think we should, we should also consider consciousness as physical unless we think its subjective nature makes it fundamentally unique. I think that consciousness should be considered a unique emergent phenomenon based on its inescapable subjective ontology. In other words, specific physical processes are necessary to produce redness; but redness can't be considered as equivalent to those physical processes. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, and so is nonhuman consciousness. Here is my explanation in a nutshell: A pain, for example, is quite simply the so-called neural correlate of the pain registered but not perceived in any way. To be sure, the process of registration in question here cries out for description in neurological terms. I am confident that this task will be accomplished in the fairly near future. Why should it be necessary for the individual in question, call him Smart (after J.J.C.) to perceive the neural correlate in any way in order for him to become aware of it? That is to say, why is it necessary that perceptual processing figure in the case? Pretty obviously, it isn\u2019t. The neural correlate occurs right there in Smart\u2019s own brain, as a natural operation of the brain. He picks up on it. That is registration, and it is not a form of perception in that it does not involve perceptual processing. When I write \u201cnot perceived in any way,\u201d then, this is to be taken strictly: Smart registers the neural correlate (if he does, for he might not), but he does not perceive it. To complete the picture, the pain as Smart himself conceives of it, in mentalistic terms, is that which appears as the neural correlate, a neural event in his brain. It appears as a neural event because that is what it is, just as that which appears as a stone appears as a stone because that is what it is. The neural correlate, then, is all that occurs, and it is not a correlate at all. It is simply the pain, as the pain appears. You do not perceive the pains you feel, then. I\u2019m sorry, but you just don\u2019t. As for the square root of minus one and all that, that is a further question, or better, a whole series of questions. Now, why not? ",
