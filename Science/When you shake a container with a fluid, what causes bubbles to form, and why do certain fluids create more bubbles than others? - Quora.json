            "answer_text": "Bubbles form because gases are hardly solvable within liquids, so when you shake the container, a liquid-gas emulsion is formed, which finally evolves into bubbles in the liquid. Surface bubbles are the result of surface tension, that is able to maintain a very thin film to trap the gas. Surface tension is different for different liquids, depending on their molecular structure. Liquids with more surface tension form more bubbles. ",

            "answer_text": "the waves or movement of the water is causing bubbles of air to b trapped in the water and interesting fact about moonshiners an experienced distiller can tell the alcohol contents or proof just by the size of the bubbles the bigger the bubbles the higher the proof I\u2019m guessing that this happens because the alcohol vaporizes fast when you shake it so more gets trapped but that\u2019s a guess ",
