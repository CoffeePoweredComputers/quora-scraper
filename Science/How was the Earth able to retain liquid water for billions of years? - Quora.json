            "answer_text": "The water cycle! Water on the planet is routinely converted between states and locations, but this water is either confined to land (liquid and ice) or is vapor. Water vapor and other vapors/gases are held within earth\u2019s atmosphere due to gravity, but at higher altitudes, this force is weakened enough that particles may be able to escape the atmosphere and enter space. This typically only happens with really light particles, like hydrogen or helium, though, as they can travel faster at the same energy level as heavier particles. Increased velocity means that a particle is more likely to reach escape velocity and exit our atmosphere! Since water molecules are significantly (by an order of magnitude) heavier than helium or hydrogen, they rarely reach escape velocity and end up condensing into precipitation to start the cycle over again!

            "answer_text": "For the first many millions of years the primordial earth was too hot for liquid water on its surface. It was probably too hot to keep water in its atmosphere. (Escape velocity and all that.) Eventually water vapor was present, finally it then cooled enough to make rain which, after additional eons, reached the surface. Then, boy!, did we see rain. after a few more million years the sun came out!! ",
