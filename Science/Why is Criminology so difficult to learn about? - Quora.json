            "answer_text": "I do not find Criminology so difficult to learn, maybe because personally I like to read a lot, I like to find solutions to particular problems, I prefer theory more than any type of study. Criminology needs you relate and familiarise yourself with it. Criminology- a scientific theory/ study that exists. It's all about research on why people commit certain crimes, how to detect them and how to prevent or minimise them, since they are real and happening. It's difficult that is a fact, only because it contains a variety of different answers. Once you become familiar with its stories (theories) the easier it is to understand it. It's easier for me, because I can relate to South African social, economical, e.t.c illnesses or rather unending crises. Thus making it easier to find my way around comprehending Criminology. By the way I am a final year student studying a B.A in Forensic science and technology as well as majoring in Criminology as an honours degree at Unisa (University of South Africa). Hope it made sense to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Criminology is a very new field academically, there is a mountain of continuously evolving information to absorb. Like psychology and sociology it is also mainly theory\u2019s with a lack of scientific data- so it is also considered to be pseudoscience. Many people who study criminology do so mistakenly, if you\u2019re hoping to be a criminal profiler or a forensic psychologist, you should go for psychology and criminal behaviour- not criminology. Study criminology if you\u2019re gonna be interested in the academic side of criminal legislation. ",
