            "answer_text": "They taught BASIC computer programming at Lindbergh HS in Renton Washington back in 1974, which I didn't take, instead I picked up computer graphics and games by playing with the HP 9830 desktop computer with plotter after school instead of having to feed it pencil-mark sense cards. Even today most of what I know in computer science I learned with BASIC and FORTRAN. That's a very good question why it is still not widely taught when you can get a PC for under $200 at Walmart and a used one for $100 at PC salvage shop and the HP desktop computer cost as much as a house in 1975. Ever since the early 20th century when my dad went to college in pre WWII China, every science/engineering  program admissions requirement includes courses in Chemistry, Biology, Physics and math up to (and now for top students including AP) Calculus. But in the 2010s, they still don't require any programming classes. MIT has always required freshmen to take Chem/Bio/Physics but not computer science. Considering that relative to the number of jobs a high school graduate can actually get with experience in Chemistry, Biology, Physics, or triginometry and factoring polynomials and solving for quadratics, programming courses are much more useful in getting a job since many people get jobs without any college course work in testing if not development or sales.  Insane education reformers have been demanding \"higher standards\" that every kindergartener be able to write sentences, every 4th grader be able to understand probability, jr high school student master algebra and ready for calculus or writing New York Times articles or composing symphonies by 11th grade, or put their block on a solar grid as a senior project, or they don't get a diploma. But none of them push for any programming, web publishing  or database classes. Object oriented programming, multiple stacks (javascript on Android ported to ASP MVC on windows talking to Oracle DB with java backend) and graphical user interfaces make it very difficult to write \"hello world\" or a simple hangman game but some basic Java or C#, web and SQL is probably more practical than understanding relativity physics and the big bang. Asking that every high school graduate has at least seen and run the solution to writing a recursive factorial program in java is probably easier and more practical than deriving e=mc2. ",

            "answer_text": "Computer science is an important part of literacy ! And it should be taught ! But as you can see from other answers, people confuse computer science with programming. THIS IS NOT THE SAME ! Not everybody needs to learn programming, programming might (!) be a way to teach computer science. In my experience (and I teach programming to first year students, so I know a bit about what is taught in schools, at least in Germany) it is not used like that.  But what is computer science ? It is a large field with many subfields like complexity theory or the design of programming languages which nearly nobody needs to know. So let's call it computational thinking. That is about how to find systematic (\"algorithmic\") solutions to problems. This is, what programming is about: Solving a problem in a way, that a computer can do it automatically. And this is important to understand for nearly everyone. At least to be able to judge, what a computer is or will be able to do. Conclusion: We should teach computational thinking to everyone. Now to your question: Why don't we do that ? My (maybe somewhat cynical) answer: Cause neither politicians nor most of the teachers understand the difference between \"programming\" and \"computer science\". What they think is: \"Not everyone needs to learn programming, it is sufficient, if they can use a computer\". They are completely right with the first part. ",
