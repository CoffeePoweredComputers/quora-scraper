            "answer_text": "This has more to do with the \u201coctet\u201d rule, and there are more than one way to add up to 8. Just because you have 5 electrons in the valence shell does not mean that you have to use (or lose) all of them. You can keep aside as many pairs as you want in a stable cache, and use the remaining ones to share and form bonds with other atoms. For example, Iodine (I) has SEVEN valence shell electrons. It can keep 3 pairs on the shelf and use the remaining one electron to form a single bond, as can be seen in hydrogen iodide H-I.Or it can keep 2 pairs on the shelf and use the remaining three electrons to form three single bonds, as can be seen in iodine trichloride (ICl3).Or it can keep 1 pair on the shelf and use the remaining five electrons to form five single bonds, as can be seen in iodine pentafluoride (IF5).Or it can use all of the 7 electrons to form seven single bonds, as can be seen in iodine heptafluoride (IF7).Similarly, Phosphorus (P) which has 5 electrons in its valence shell, can form trivalent compounds (PCl3) with a lone pair remaining on the shelf, or use all 5 valence electrons to form pentavalent PCl5. Therefore, it has two valencies - 3 and 5. ",
