            "answer_text": "Ethics are like the rules of a spirting contest. They are guidelines of conduct that ensure a \u201clevel playing field\u201d. For example, it would be unethical for me to conspire to have my opponents food tainted in some way that reduces his/her performance. In like fashion, it would also be unethical to manufacture false allegations of marital infidelity to psychologically or emotionally imbalance my opponent. Ethics vary from situation to situation and have to be adjusted periodically in response to the impact of new tecnologies on human relations. The best system for maintaining an ethical society is to observe a tradition of logical and compassionate education and nurture of succeeding generations. ",
