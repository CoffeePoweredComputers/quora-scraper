            "answer_text": "Some terms to be understood before we have a look on Re-ionisation Ionisation or Ionization: It is the process by which an atom or a molecule gains a negative or positive charge by gaining or loosing electrons to form bond between similar or different elements.  (Refers to Ionisation) Recombination: it is the time at which electron and proton bounds to make electrically neutral hydrogen atoms. Red shifting: It is a phenomenon where electromagnetic radiation from an object undergoes an increase in wavelength equivalent to a decrease in wave frequency and photon energy. Re-ionisation in big bang referred to hydrogen re-ionisation and of primordial helium because after the dark ages baryonic matter was in the form of helium and hydrogen. Going backwards to dark ages (an opaque universe). That is due to scattering of photons of free electron. But it became more transparent as proton and electron combines to form neutral hydrogen atoms. And reason behind Dark Age was cooling of universe which resulted higher rate of recombination than re-ionisation rate.  (Reference for dark age only) And the Dark Age objects started condensing in early universe which had enough energy to re-ionise neutral hydrogen. However at that time natter has been diffused and scattering of photons and electrons were much lesser and universe became low density ionised hydrogen and remained transparent as we are seeing now. In a nutshell. -scattering of photons and electrons and resulted higher rate of recombination than re-ionisation rate leads universe to Dark ages \u00a0-Between 150 million to one billion years after big bang objects in dark ages had enough energy. \u00a0-these energy leads to re-ionise neutral hydrogen (which were result of recombination.\u00a0Moral in my opinion is re-ionisation made primordial elements of universe into observable one as we have now.
