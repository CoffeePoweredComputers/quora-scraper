            "answer_text": "What is the nature of scientific knowledge? The word science itself means knowledge. We glean what we call knowledge from what sources, external or within our own thought processes, we can. Perhaps let\u2019s first say what science can\u2019t do. Science is not good at finding answers to existential questions. Questions about our situation that start with \u201cwhy?\u201d It is not good at making pronouncements about anything that can\u2019t be physically perceived using our senses such as sight, touch, hearing, taste and smell. Science operates from a database of information derived from human sensory perception, and attempts to describe, measure and explain how its discoveries fit together, operate and play their part in the workings of the cosmos. It\u2019s no good asking a scientist to explain, prove or for that matter disprove, metaphysical stuff like god, religion, myths or like transcendental matters. You might ask then is psychology a science? Yes, inasmuch as it deals with and analyses observed human behaviour. ",

            "answer_text": "In theory scientific knowledge is based on factual results of experimentation about which a storey is weaved and called an hypothesis. If it is considered more or less certain it attains the status of Theory. Of course before an experiment is performed it helps to have a rough idea of what one is looking for. Its a bit like the chicken and the egg, each precedes or leads the other. And then there are Laws which are either axiomatic or are firmly established on the basis of observation and considered unshakeable. Regards. ",
