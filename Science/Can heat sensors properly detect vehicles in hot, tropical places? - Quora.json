            "answer_text": "Heat sensors work by detecting infra-red emissions, also known as hot light. And just like other forms of light, if the background infra-red light is bright enough, it will make it hard to detect a hot spot. It also depends on how \u201chot\u201d the object is that you want to detect. When a detector \u201csees\u201d a car, what it usually sees is the engine and the occupants, which tend to be much brighter than the background infra-red. So even in a very hot area, like a tropical beach, an ICE car would still be visible. While the air temperature would be warm, the engine of the car and the person inside the car would be even hotter. ",
