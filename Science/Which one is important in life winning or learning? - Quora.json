The most important thing in life is learning.every Moment you experience is a learning moment.Many people don't recognize it. People who won more learn less than the people who lose more. If your willing learn then your willing to win. Many great legends who won was once a loser and who learned the lesson from it. The main goal of the life is learning it ,not winning it.How much you won it doesn't matters but how much learn that's what matters in life. Life itself is a book ,learn it don't postpone to read at sometime.Learn it in evey moment you breath. ",

            "answer_text": "When one learns something, there's a possibility of that learning being useful for performing purposeful action, which could impact the lives of one or more beings, positively. Whatever one has learned can be reused, refined and shared with others, which naturally multiplies the value of learning, manifold. When one wins a competition or contest - real or imaginary - other than being a steroid shot for one's ego, and possibly offering momentary happiness for supporters / fans / enablers, the act of winning itself does not necessarily create any significant change, either in the individual or in the society (mere inspiration / motivation to others from one's winning doesn't always result in purposeful action). But, if one learns to treat both winning and losing the same way, without being either elated or deflated, then being part of the action takes precedence over the outcome. Performing actions - including competing - to the best of one's ability, while remaining detached from the results such action - winning, losing - is Karma Yoga. That's most certainly worthy of learning! ~Swamy | @PrakashSwamy ",
