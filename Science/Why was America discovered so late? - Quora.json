            "answer_text": "Asia and Europe are essentially one big continent. Since times immemorial there was near unhindered flow of people, trade, ideas and armies across Asia, Europe and Northern Africa. This trade would be via land or the relatively gentle waters of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf etc The ancient Phoenicians did explore much of the African west coast, but at least since the Middle Ages, the Europeans did not sail south of Morocco. In the 15th century the Portuguese developed the carack and the caravel, greatly improving their ability to navigate the deep oceans. It wasn't a mere coincidence that Columbus got to America, and Vasco Da Gama got to India (via a sea route), in the same decade. But before that navigating the deep oceans on a regular basis was out of the question. The Azores, an island less than 1000 miles off of Portugal was only formally discovered in 1427 (though it might have been shown in maps since 1340). The Bahamas, which Columbus discovered on his first voyage in 1492, is still about 2000 miles to the West. So it was very unlikely to be discovered by mistake. It is likely that some European ships blown of course could have ended up on the North American continent, but its unlikely that people would have survived for that long, and even more unlikely for them to make the trip back. Anyway, Columbus was not the first human to get to the Americas. When he got there, he found it well populated by people he called, \"Indians\". These people, the Native Americans, are ancestors of hunter-gathering people who crossed the land-bridge over the Bering Sea that existed during the last Ice Age. This was at least 16,500 years ago, some arguing as much as 40,000 years ago.  The Norse Vikings did reach North America too, via the sea route, but they followed a system of island hopping - discovering the Shetland islands near Scotland, then the Faroe Islands, then Iceland, then Greenland and finally modern Newfoundland in Canada (around 990 CE). The last three at least were first found by ships that got lost. Their North American colonies died out pretty quickly, but that is a whole different but remarkable story. Finally, another people might have also reached America via the sea route: the Polynesians. There exists some DNA analysis of links between Polynesian islands in the Pacific, and South America, with suggestions that they were established around 500 to 700 CE. But we don't really know if it was the Polynesians who went to America, or the native Americans who reached Polynesia, though its the former that seems most plausible. ",
