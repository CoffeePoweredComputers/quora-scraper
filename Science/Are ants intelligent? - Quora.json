Yep, just 2 days ago I noticed a couple of aphid \u201cfarms\u201d also in our garden. I don\u2019t know how the ants came up with the idea of taking care of the aphids in order to \u201cmilk\u201d them; they might not even be aware of doing it, but some ant somewhere must have started that. Sure, the world is full of symbiotic species, but the ant-aphid relation looks kind of similar to us and the cows. I wouldn\u2019t have a clue how to measure the intelligence of an ant, but from what I see, they are one of the most successful life forms on this planet. ",

As for ants specifically, they thrive.  They have more biomass than humans and a huge range.  This doesn't prove intelligence but it does prove effectiveness. ",

Scavenging for food is a difficult task. How do you find it? how do you let other ants know when you have found food if its too big to carry back? Pheremones. Ants leave a trail of them every where they go and they tell other ants different things. When an ant finds food it retraces its original tail back to the colony and may provide free samples once there. Other ants will take on that trail making it stronger and stronger until the most direct path is achieved. How Small Is an Ant\u2019s Brain Compared to an Elephant\u2019s Brain? ",

            "answer_text": "What makes ants so fascinating is that an ant is not smart but ants are smart. A single ant has a tiny brain, and is a simple, dumb creature that responds to local cues in its environment. However, this dumb local behavior adds up to something smart and produces complex, emergent colony-level behavior. As a very simple example, ants near the nest entrance decide whether to go out and forage based on how many foragers are coming back into the nest. If few foragers are coming back, then they go out to forage. In this way, the colony keeps the right amount of foragers out. ",
