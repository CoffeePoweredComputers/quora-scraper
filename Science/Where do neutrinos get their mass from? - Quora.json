            "answer_text": "essentially, we don\u2019t know. In the Standard Model, neutrinos have to be massless, because only a left-handed variety has ever been detected. So they can\u2019t interact with the Higgs field, because any interaction with the Higgs field would change the handedness to right-handed. And thus they are exempt from having mass. Later it was found that neutrinos do have mass. This was derived from the neutrino oscillations that let the neutrinos change their flavor in mid-flight. Any change means that the particle experiences time, i.e. it is slower than the speed of light and therefore must have mass. There have been several attempts to explain this, falling back on the Higgs mechanism. One way is assuming that the neutrinos are Majorana particles. I.e. they are there own anti-particles. Which in a sense means that there is no left-handedness or right-handedness. Because a right-handed neutrino can be seen as just a left-handed anti-neutrino. An explanation would be that right-handed neutrinos are extremely heavy, and they can\u2019t exist for any observable time. Which means that there are always two interactions with the Higgs field within the time imposed by Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle. And we can see only the light left-handed ones. And of course string theory and supersymmetry fanatics have their own explanations, including right-handed neutrinos not to be bound by the m-branes. A problem in gaining understanding of the neutrino masses is that up to now we haven\u2019t been able to measure them. ",

            "answer_text": "Where do neutrinos get their mass from? Ordinary particles get their mass from the Higgs boson. Neutrinos are not ordinary particles. They are \u201crelativistic mass symmetry\u201d particles. Thus their relativistic mass is equal to minus the rest mass of their symmetric ordinary particles. Their mass is always a million times less than that of ordinary particles, because their Lorentz factors are always greater than 10^6, that\u2019s a million. Neutrinos must get their mass from their \u201crelativistic mass symmetry\u201d Higgs boson, which would be a million times less mass than ordinary matter\u2019s Higgs boson, and of course invisible and hard to detect except through gravity and the weak force.
