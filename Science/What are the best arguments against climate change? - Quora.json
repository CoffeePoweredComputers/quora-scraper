            "answer_text": "There are no arguments against climate change because the cause, extra radiative forcing (global warming) is as proven as any other science. We have the \u201ctheory of electromagnetism\u201d, which is real enough to me, to all the scientists and to all the skeptics, even. So, what is that makes people think there should be an argument against one type of science, but not the other? Newsflash: It\u2019s the same science! I can surmise that it\u2019s really not the science that all these people are upset about. It\u2019s the politics. Most people know that too many GHGs will cause heating of the biosphere, however, most people also know that they can\u2019t afford to build a nuclear power plant, or tons of solar and wind, for their community to solve their share of the problem. Then, they see that Trump won\u2019t (or doesn\u2019t appear to be) doing anything about it. Worse yet, they see the \u201cgreen\u201d groups oppose big solar, wind and nuclear, and then propose stupid things (non solutions, like trains) as a solution. If I was president, no one would be skeptical, because we would be mostly powered by wind, solar and batteries by the eighth year\u2026 We need strong techno moderates to run for the presidents of the world. In short, the best argument against climate change is that it\u2019s solutions are not taken seriously by the left\u2026 (see my profile pinned page). ",

            "answer_text": "My problem with anthropogenic climate change theory is that it is all based on computer models, and these cannot be verified to be correct over long tiem spans. I know someone wil jump in here saying how it\u2019s all verified, but there is simply no way. The climate is too complex to model. Anyone in engineering knows how very complex even simple computer models are, like those computing NVH (essentially noise in automobiles). Those programs require a lot of validation, and they are not perfect. The climate is orders-of-magnitude more complex than that. Here\u2019s a simple story that illustrates the point. Back after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, American scientists, led by Carl Sagan (a patron saint of lefty scientists) predicted that if we tried to liberate Kuwait, Hussein would torch the oil fields, and the resulting soot would float through the atmosphere, creating something analogous to a \u201cnuclear winter.\u201d A nuclear winter was a concept that a nuclear war would stir up so much dust into the atmosphere that it would block enough of the sun\u2019s rays to cool the earth: no crops would grow and we would all starve. Well, Sagan & Co, were half right. Hussein did indeed torch the oil fields, and it was pretty smoky before we got it all extinguished. But there was no nuclear winter. Sagan and Co. had forgotten about rain, which washed the skies clear before the soot could get to the upper reaches of the atmosphere. And that was that. I see climate change as the same \u201cThe sky is falling mantra.\u201d And of course you have to understand that the \u201cvast majority of scientists who agree on climate change\u201d know on which side their bread is buttered. How many grants are offered to climate change deniers? As in everything else, \u201cFollow the money.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s 620AM. Martha wakes up & as she rubs her eyes, she checks out the window to see if there\u2019s sunshine. There isn\u2019t. As if the morning sun shining bright would make a difference. It was winter after all and winters for Martha seemed forever gloomy. And then there was the universal dilemma on what to wear. It was heavily tilted towards what not to wear but nevertheless a dilemma, especially when it came to warm clothing. To add to it, over the past one week she had been sensing a growing pain in her lower back. She had wondered even whilst at work and dismissed thoughts of the chair or her work posture being a reason for it. She had attended a seminar on ergonomic hygiene and the brand that was advertised was the equipment she rested her hands or bum on, Monday to Friday. She heard her husband shuffle in his bed, as she scrambled on the side table to find her glasses. It was just a shuffle. He wouldn\u2019t be waking up until a good 45 minutes more and his alarm had a name, Martha. A mother of two children aged 6 and 12, and an IT professional just like anyone else who could open their mouth and continue to speak in jargons that keep changing every year. The alarm even went on to deliver a cup of coffee for his sleepy eyes, and a cup of milk each for the tiny tots, every single morning. Time was of essence for Martha and somehow, the morning minutes seemed to pass like weekends, skidding away. But waking up was never a problem for Martha. It was as if her body had invisible sensors that activated her conscience against the problems to be, if she were to wake up a few minutes late, on weekdays. Her body clock had been tuned immaculately over the past several years, and was like clockwork by this time. Even a regular clock or a watch had to be corrected as per daylight savings at least once a year, but not hers. It had even adjusted to the fact that on Saturday\u2019s and Sunday\u2019s she could sleep until 0730AM. An hour more of priceless sleep. And most people keep getting fascinated by science, she thought. They must think more of a mother\u2019s life-science. There\u2019s lay a sea of lessons for Mankind in it, she thought. Her son Malloy and daughter Olive were abundant kids. Abundant not to say financially but in displaying extreme levels of raw energy. They could go on u til their eyelids had to be closed by her thumb at night but of late she had found a solution in Batman & Dora sleep masks. They seemed to have done the trick. There were times when Martha & Andrew (spouse) would spend a minute in minus temperatures, explaining to a unsuspecting host the possibility of things breaking or bending or shattering during their visit. They would however allay the fears that they would try to not to let it happen and were kind enough to offer damage compensation. It was the best they could do if they had to have some semblance of socializing, outside their home. It was 715AM by the time she had prepared breakfast & lunch for the day. At times she would be looked upon in astonishment when she claimed to get food ready for the day in less than an hour. Weave a web of \u2018things to do\u2019 in front of a Mom, shelve her time in half & ask her to do what she can. She will find a way to do her best, for it\u2019s her kids on the line, doesn\u2019t matter if she can\u2019t rest. There is no other relationship that conquers discomfort, like motherhood does. As she yelled at her neutron and proton to be on the breakfast couch for their morning nibble, she felt a twitch in her back just as she picked up a shoe from the kitchen floor. Andrew was lenient & had let the kids choose the couch for breakfast instead of a table, as a reward for finishing what\u2019s given as breakfast. Malloy was a good negotiator but his genes were from his Dad so he had to give in. Give in to the lack of experience that is. He was learning that experience was necessary even on top of sheer brilliance. Martha ignored the pain and smiled as Olive raised her empty glass of milk in a show of pride. As is usually the case, sensibility started to grow in her daughter and her abundant energy started to be challenged into sports, mainly in tennis & swimming. Malloy on the other hand was a stubborn kid. He was extremely logic driven and had a tendency to try & trod the crevices around house rules, as a way of flexing his negotiating muscles. His parents as well read as they were, knew that he was mastering the art of denial. An act done knowingly, with a knowledge that the risks involved are not proven on paper. Or the associated risks have plenty a contradicting arguments, leaving open a strand or two of doubt open for the risk not being a risk at all. He had been told to not use his smart phone for more than 4 hours a day. It had been a few days of negotiation to arrive at that number. Yet when the notification popped up every Sunday noon, he would average 7 hours on most weeks. He lived in denial that the screen time did not have an adverse effect on him & to his advantage, he had good grades at school to show for. There were visible dark circles by now and he continued to be in denial, being the stubborn child that he was. His body was taking a toll but due to his metabolism & battery of energy, there wasn\u2019t anything other than the dark circles to blame, yet. He was also in his school skateboarding acrobat team. And he attributed the dark circles to lack of melanin in his skin & was currently experimenting with a lotion that seemed to be working for his friends at school. Their dark circles, unlike Malloy were not from Late night hours spent reading up Wikipedia or listening to podcasts on how stuff works. Gaming was their thing that kept them awake at night. This morning, an argument broke out when Andrew snatched Malloy\u2019s phone as he spilled food over the carpet, while reading a blog explaining what made a bottle of carbonated drink fly in the air when shaken rigorously. Martha came in defense of Malloy & bent over to clean up the carpet and that\u2019s when everyone in the household became aware of her discomfort in the back. Fast forward a few hours & Martha was busy attending a conference call and when it ended, she had received approval for a staggered development plan for a software release, which was originally approved to occur in one go. Life goes on, for as long as there is ignorance. Change happens when there is acceptance. Why the story? To draw an analogy. Martha, the Mom = Mother Earth (Relentlessly strives to give all forms of species a chance at experiencing the bliss called life. Keeps taking in everything dumped onto her, and of late into her core, in the form of plastic, cordoned off polluted rivers, radiation zones, co2 and the list goes on).  Malloy the boy = Humankind, us (Believing in our ability to overcome any and every problem through the lens of technological advancement, believing that there\u2019s a cure to every symptom, like he believed he could continue to sleep less, continue to grow smarter, & use a quick fix to get rid of his dark circles) Olive the daughter = Other species on Earth (The silent spectator. Knowing & understanding everything that was going on around, yet finding oneself helpless, yet evolving in newer ways to adopt to the change, or hoping to) Malloy\u2019s friends at School - Anti-climate change enthusiasts (The ignorant, or the ones backed by the ones with vested commercial interests. Propagating an idea that all is good & there\u2019s a cure for everything, a problem to every solution, often getting the minds mixed with neatly laced facts, like the idea of a lotion that could rid Malloy of his dark circles). Andrew, the Dad - The Government (Aware of everything that\u2019s going on, being observant, making inferences, drawing plans, battling opposition, finding funds, counting on scientists hard at work to crack the next solution. Often blamed for not having an intent to change things, but being intent-filled yet finding it hard to convince of the good being done, for there\u2019s so much to be done). Martha\u2019s Back pain = floods, droughts, forest fires, global warming, rising sea levels/temperatures, vanishing of coral reefs. Anti-climate change - Kids at school (Providing an alibi (melanin dose) - wrongly believing it works & that there\u2019s nothing about to happen from lack of sleep at a young formative years). Climate change is real. The signs are too evident to ignored or to try and justify. Like visible dark circles that can be hidden only temporarily. Any argument trying to prove that climate change isn\u2019t real, is akin to Malloy\u2019s art of denial. And we don\u2019t have to wait for Mother Earth to keep showing more and worse forms of pain, for she deserves some respite too. ",

Reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.S. I have put the most significant items in quotation marks so the reader will take note. National Research Council (NRC) have stated that future climate change \"has the potential\" to cause air quality degradation via climate-induced changes in meteorology and atmospheric chemistry. A Synthesis of Climate Change Impacts on Ground-Level Ozone, describing the results from studies using linked climate change and air quality models to simulate the \u201cpossible range of changes in ozone (O3) concentrations.\u201d Because of the extreme complexity of the coupled climate-air quality-health system, \u201cand the many uncertainties present at each step of analysis,\u201d it is most useful to frame this study as a sensitivity analysis. Therefore, we have attempted to assess the sensitivity of modeled human health impacts \u201cto assumptions about, and modeling and methodological choices.\u201d There is no one \u201ccorrect\u201d set of C-R functions to use to estimate O3-related adverse health effects, and EPA has used different sets of functions in different benefits analyses involving O3, as both methods and available functions have evolved over time. The large preponderance of results across the different climate change/air quality models and population projections \u201csuggest that\u201d, all else being equal, climate change would produce an increase in O3-related adverse health effects in 2050. Since climate change \"may\" alter weather patterns, and, hence, \"potentially\" increase the frequency, duration, and intensity of O3 episodes in some regions, this \"has the potential\" to create additional challenges for air quality managers. However, \"the links between long term global climate change and O3 changes is not necessarily straightforward,\" reflecting a balance among multiple interacting factors (U.S. EPA, 2009a). For example, the current relationship between temperature and O3 does not necessarily provide a basis for predicting O3 concentrations in a warmer future climate, since higher temperatures are often correlated with other important drivers of O3 such as sunlight and stagnation (NRC, 1991; U.S. EPA, 2009a). There has recently been much emphasis on the uncertainty surrounding several of the inputs to the typical air pollution benefits analysis (see, for example, National Research Council, 2001). \u201cThe uncertainty surrounding climate change is even greater.\u201d The \u201cuncertainty\u201d in our analysis is thus substantial and comes from multiple sources. Assessing and characterizing this uncertainty is therefore an important part of our analysis. While some of this uncertainty \u2013 in particular, the statistical uncertainty surrounding estimated coefficients in C-R functions \u2013 can easily be quantified, much of it cannot. \"Each climate change model simulation is an attempt to approximate a future complex reality\", just as each air quality simulation is an attempt to approximate a future complex reality, contingent on the future reality approximated by the linked climate change model.

I would recommend asking \u201cWhat are the best arguments that climate change today is not being caused by humans?\u201d. There are five general \u201cbeliefs\u201d expressed from proponents of anthropogenic climate change and deniers of anthropogenic climate change: Climate Change is not occurringClimate Change is occurring and it is caused by humansClimate Change is occurring and it is not caused by humansWe don\u2019t know if Climate Change is OccurringClimate Change is occurring and we don\u2019t know what is causing itI am in camp #5. Is climate change occurring? I live in Alaska so I see climate change occurring and from all scientific data I\u2019ve seen so far I believe it is occurring. On the other hand I have seen many models from both sides of the issue purporting to compare current trends with historical trends and I am not impressed. I believe more research is needed before we can make any conclusions that current trends are not within historical norms. We may be looking at a natural cycle repeated on the earth many times but from evidence I\u2019ve seen I think we don\u2019t know if this is normal. What is causing climate change? Here also the science is deficient. To properly analyze climate change and the effects of various gasses in the atmosphere on it we need to know all the sources and sinks for sunlight energy, geothermal energy, CO2 and other gasses, and H2O in its vapor, liquid, and solid states. Our models use too many assumptions to do this properly today. Instead of arguing about causes that we cannot calculate today using models we should develop an agreed upon model incorporating all inputs and outputs for carbon and other gasses. Instead our scientific conferences devolve into discussions of which uncertainties are valid and which are not valid. A robust and complete model will take a lot of work but we\u2019re capable of it. Once we have that the cause and the solution, if one is needed, will be clear. Just by saying \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d my fellow scientists will label me a denier but that\u2019s not true. I am just saying \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d. ",

Man-made climate change isn\u2019t real. 5-There are many simple fixes that can be implemented to help future generations, but if we agree to not have future generations, can\u2019t the problem be solved? These are the common ones. The most concrete argument is that a person doesn\u2019t care as they have no obligation to do anything. This does not deem climate change to exist or not, but is a personal decision. As you can see, the concrete argument against it will not come from the climate change aspect of it. What is going to happen is that the goalposts will be slowly moved and little will happen. Climate change doesn\u2019t exist. It exists but isn\u2019t important. It is important, but human activity is minimal. Human activity has some effect on it, but not much. It has an effect, but we will lose too much if we change.

Apparently yes. Of course, a certain amount of humility is in order - during the 50s to 70s the measured global average was going down, and climatologists were worried that we were heading into another ice age. Which, from the proxy record, is about due. Nonetheless, we do a much better job of data collection than we did 50 years ago, and the current warming seems not to be a temporary thing. 2 - (and this is where things get tricky) Is the increased warming caused by people? That is, what fraction is anthropogenic? This is potentially more problematic. It is clear that atmospheric CO2 is increasing due to human activity, and an excellent case has been made to link the two. A mechanism has been proposed (greenhouse gas) which is quite convincing. But. There is a fundamental issue that is never addressed. \u201cIf there were no human-caused changes, such as CO2 emissions, what would the climate be like?\u201d And there is no easy way to determine this, since we have no way of measuring climate in the absence of the anthropogenic influences which have been identified. That computer models predict warming is not actually a guarantee that the models are correct, only that they have been properly tuned to give results which seem reasonable. ",

The earth is 6 billion years old. Really? There have been at least two \u201cmini ice ages\" in the common era. About 600CE and 1600CE, and the bible lists several verified famines in Egypt well before the common era and people who are experts in the field of archeology have begun to suspect the Central and South American civilizations died out in part due to famine and food shortage with some help from Cortez et al and the flu. South of Phoenix east of Casa Grande, Arizona lie the remnants of the large flourishing community of ancient Pueblo peoples that died out because the water in the Gila Valley, teeming with fish, simply dried up and the people moved on\u2026this community had lived and farmed in the Gila Valley until about 1450 and had been there for a thousand years. So I remain skeptical about \u201cclimate change\u201d. But I am a complete believer in the cyclical nature of climate. Good science tells us the appearance and lack of appearance of sunspots suggest more relevance than cow farts, car exhausts and power plants. By the way, get rid of dams because the hurt salmon but don't build power plants because they pollute the air we breath.

By contrast, a strong majority of the 1,077 respondents believe that nature is the primary cause of recent global warming and/or that future global warming will not be a very serious problem. https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2019/03/new_peerreviewed_study_reveals_majority_of_scientists_are_skeptical_of_global_warming_crisis.html ",

The question asked is not what is important to you question but the list of quotes from so many people and organizations showing the purpose of the scare of climate change should answer your question. Please be patient with the first few lines. The quotes are important and shed light on the truth. Are there any other factors besides climate change that might be causing the ice in the Arctic/Antarctic to melt? Allen Rogers, Retired manufacturing plant engineer. Studied climate change Answered May 20 Yes - there are many other factors. Orbital variations - Milankovitch cycles, Changes in sun activity - output levels Changes in sun-spot activity, which leads to changes in cosmic radiation levels, which lead to changes in lower cloud cover. The more sun-spots there are, the warmer the global climate becomes, and the fewer sun-spots, the colder the climate becomes.

Dave Foreman, co-founder of Earth First! - \u201cWe must make this an insecure and inhospitable place for capitalists and their projects. We must reclaim the roads and plowed land, halt dam construction, tear down existing dams, free shackled rivers and return to wilderness millions of acres of presently settled land.\u201d Quote in The New American 7 March 2013 ",

            "answer_text": "There aren\u2019t any. Human-caused climate catastrophe is a fact. Live with it, and better still, act on it. The evidence is overwhelming. In scientific terms, the mechanism driving it has been well-understood physics in the 19th century. I learned about it in high school physics. In the 1970s, the Club of Rome published a series of reports, which examined the effects of projecting then-current trends into the future. 30 years later, they were compared to the historical record. Their \u201cworst case scenario\u201d was uncannily close to what had happened. People with relevant expertise are in near-unanimous agreement. The latest figure is, 99% of climate researchers state climate catastrophe is here, now, it is rapidly worsening, and we are the cause. The remaining few? Follow the money. In 2014, the IPCC gave us 30 years for effective action. In 2018, this became 12 years. This year, it is 18 months. This is as new evidence comes in. Wake up! But you don\u2019t need science. Use unbiased, rational observation. In my part of the world, 1939 had the worst bushfires of all time till then. A scale was devised, with the 1939 conditions arbitrarily set at 100. In 2009, the conditions were rated at 150. The fires were hugely more destructive than in 1939. Predictions in the 1980s for my area were that climate change\u2019s main effect would be reduced rainfall. In 2005 or thereabouts, considerable rain fell, and hey, the dams were full! The rainfall that year was the AVERAGE of 20 years before. You will find the same kinds of changes everywhere on the planet. If you don\u2019t believe in climate change, talk to some wise locals. ",

One can, however, point to many holes in the arguments that CO2 is having an effect: Climate \u201cscience\u201d is in its infancy and cannot even answer many basic questionsWhat are the factor(s) that led to the first Ice Age? (it was unprecedented)What factor(s) led to the coolings that caused the subsequent Ice Ages?What factor(s) led to the warmings that ended past Ice Ages?The climate, without any intervention, cannot yet be predicted (for example, they don\u2019t know when, or if, the next ice age would occur, much less how)When the future climate without intervention cannot be predicted, there is no way to tell how much of current climate change (if any) is due to mankind.Since how the climate actually changes is still unknown, any natural counter-effects (such as increased greening caused by higher CO2 levels) are largely unknown and unaccounted for in climate \u201cmodels\u201d.So far \u201cclimate scientists\u201d have had virtually no success with any prediction whose dates have passed (ice free arctic, polar bear extinction, disruptively higher sea levels, etc.). More examples are here and here.Now that the \u201chockey stick\u201d chart has been debunked, I have yet to see any reason to be alarmed at temperature and sea level changes so gradual that they are imperceptible to people without very expensive equipment.Then, on top of the holes in their arguments, the fact that the climate alarmists use outright dishonest techniques to spread fear further undercuts their credibility. Their language is dishonest. They changed the name from \u201cglobal warming\u201d to \u201cclimate change\u201d because the warming wasn\u2019t apparent enough. And for both they deliberately omit the adjective \u201cmanmade\u201d from them, when it is THE critical distinction (very few deny that the climate changes or that it has been warming, more or less, since the end of the last ice age). And then switching to \u201cclimate crisis\u201d when \u201cclimate change\u201d wasn\u2019t generating enough fear.They point to glaciers outside of the arctic which have been shrinking for thousands of years (they are technically relics from the last ice age), and claim that manmade climate change is responsible for their melting.They routinely cite infrequent (but not unprecedented) weather occurrences as \u201cproof\u201d - when it is nothing of the sort. Until and unless such events can be understood well enough to be predicted, there is no way to scientifically determine a cause.They never admit being wrong- after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, they were claiming that more frequent and severe hurricanes were \u201cproof\u201d of global warming, then dropped it and ignored reality when the next decade was one of the quietest in recorded history.Climategate was largely ignored, and no changes were made to improve integrity or transparency of the underlying data.",

World temperatures are rising slowly at the moment at about 1C per hundred years, a typical rate for such changes - although there have been time when the change has been much faster.  The theory that man is influencing that change significantly depends on the effect of an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere form a measured 0.028% in the 1950 to O.041% today. This could block more of the infrared radiation than it used to, from about 15nm to about 20nm in the \u2018water vapour\u2019 window, the wavelengths not fully blocked by water vapour (this is about 1/200th of the complete infrared spectrum. This seems likely to be a minute effect, if it exists at all. There appears to be no evidence for it having any effect at the moment. ",

But I can tell you, the facts have been exaggerated and in some cases made up over the years and that reduces the validity of the claims: But you can read claims as follows and make up your own mind. [The Arctic ocean is warming up, icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot, according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consulafft, at Bergen, Norway. Reports from fishermen, seal hunters and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone. Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes. Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the gulf stream still very warm. Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared. Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of herring and smelts which have never before ventured so far north, are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds.  I apologize, I neglected to mention that this report was from November 2, 1922. As reported by the AP and published in The Washington Post \u2014 88 years ago!] ",

If it\u2019s the latter, than scientific measures show that greenhouse gasses are increasing and the earth IS getting warmer. We know we should be going into a cooling phase because of the stage of the milankovitch cycle we are currently in. Sadly, we are warming instead and at a rapid rate. That is due to AGW (anthropogenic {caused by humans} global warming). It has been predicted for decades that if we got to an atmospheric CO2 level of 400 ppm, then so much of the radiated heat from the earth, which should have been passing through the atmosphere, would actually be trapped. We are above that threshold already, ergo, Global Warming. Arguments at this time are generally from denialists. They have their perceptions but the science is in on this issue. This is not to say we can\u2019t do something about it. As they say, \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way.\u201d Hopefully we address it before it is irreversible and we wipe ourselves and many other species off the earth. Sorry about being a Debbie Downer, but at this point, pretending it isn\u2019t happening is just shortsighted. I\u2019m not sugarcoating it. If I was wrong, I\u2019d be the first one to dance around the block doing my happy dance. If you disagree, find a like minded forum and peddle your view there. ",

The case for AGW is made on a regular basis. You can look up the work of James Lawrence Powell, a scientist formerly advising Reagan and Bush I. He compiled a list of all climate-related papers submitted to peer review over the last few years and found that 99.99% of them accepted AGW as reality. Videos of his findings are on his website at James Lawrence Powell. The fact that thousands of published papers in the scientific community accept AGW without question should indicate that there are no scientifically valid arguments to be made against the effect humans have on global heating.

The answers are: YesYesWe\u2019re working on that. The models vary, but they\u2019re improving. Guess what, predicting what will happen to the entire planet decades in the future isn\u2019t super easy. Whodathunkit?If there is a 1% chance that China will invade, we don\u2019t just shrug and call it unlikely.

But just as in the other scenarios, doing nothing to prepare for the possibility of great harm from climate change is genocidally stupid.Details: To answer your question directly: There aren\u2019t any. Climate change is happening. In fact, the climate has changed many times in Earth\u2019s history\u2014ice ages, etc. Areas are being reclassified as to what plants will grow there and when they will bloom. Glaciers are melting. I read that people in Australia were considering whether their \u201cdrought\u201d was actually the new permanent climate there. Even most of the tinfoil hat crowd realize that if they pretend climate change isn\u2019t happening at all, people will be laughing at them too hard for the rest of their rants to be heard. Plenty of people are still pushing the claim that all the current climate change is just natural, that people didn\u2019t cause this. They throw out lots of reasonable seeming ideas\u2014if only they hadn\u2019t already been checked and found not to be the cause. Solar cycles, magnetic fields, Milanovich cycles.

The current debate has to with our role in the climate change that is currently unfolding. Let us take a look at what we can see, and how that affects climate. The climate has been warming over the latest decades, and at an ever accelerating rate - we have direct measurements to prove this.The warming is global - we follow it all over the globe.The poles are the most affected areas, and are warming faster than the rest of the globe - the heating up of arctic areas of the northern hemisphere has been monitored closely over the years.CO2 is a strong greenhouse gas - this reason for this has been know for many years and can the effect can be directly measured in the laboratory.Atmospheric CO2 has been on the rise for more than 200 years - we have direct measurements going back thousands of years.The extra CO2 comes from carbon originally laid down by living organisms (fossil carbon) - we do measure the C-12 to C-13 ratio to know this.Mankind has extracted and burned fossil carbon in ever increasing amounts over the last 200 years - easily explaining why the CO2-level is rising.We can explain our observations as the result of human behavior.As shown above, we can easily explain, predict, and verify man-made climate changes, so the time is not to doubt what we can easily see - we better get going and act on the facts!

            "answer_text": "The argument is that MAN has caused it, because our CO2 knocked the \u201cbalance\u201d of nature out of kilter. Is that true? There is no concrete proof that it is, but there is evidence that it is not. What is it? We emit about 40 GT CO2 a year, which is 4% of the total annual emissions (earth/nature emits the remaining 96%). This gives a 25:1 ratio. Multiply our 40 times 25, and you get 1 trillion tons. Subtract our 20 that it is said to be unabsorbed each year, and you have 980. The highest estimate I\u2019ve seen (New Scientist) says earth/nature absorbs 770 GT CO2 on an annual basis. Subtract 770 from 980, and you get 210. The ratio is now 10.5:1, in favor of earth/nature.Those 210 are not our cumulative, as we are talking annual. Those 210 belong to earth/nature. Earth/nature has been out of kilter for a long time. How do I know that? In order to maintain our 4%, which we have done (I\u2019ve seen as low as 3.74%, but round up for argument\u2019s sake), then if we increase, it has to increase, and the records show just that. With such WIDE disparities in the amount of CO2 MAN emits, and what earth/nature emits, how can any rational being blame us for the existence of global climate change? ",

Those who believe it have their own scientific reasons to back their claims, others have their own reasons to disregard their theory. Understanding global warming and its impact is important to meet the challenges pose by it. ",
