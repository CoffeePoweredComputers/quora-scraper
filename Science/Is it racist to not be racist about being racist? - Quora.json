            "answer_text": "I\u2019m guessing that you consider your question to be clever or insightful. It\u2019s not. Your question reflects a growing sense of self described \u201cenlightened\u201d conservatives who define racism down. Without an overt action and loud declaration of race hatred, they search for plausible explanations for obvious racial animus. The next step is to actually enjoy being called a racist and claiming not to care. You\u2019ll be seeing \u201cfine people\u201d in a gathering of Nazi\u2019s and KKK members soon, while scoffing at the PC society that views racists with rightful disgust. Lincoln said, \u201cIf slavery is not wrong, then nothing is wrong.\u201d I think you can substitute the word \u201cracism\u201d for \u201cslavery\u201d and you\u2019ll have the answer to your question. Tolerating racism is a tacit endorsement. It displays your comfort with ignorance, hatred and true evil. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe you are asking whether it is racist to ignore the racism in others? In the sense that ignoring evil is to be complicit in it, yes, you are enabling racism by your inaction. It is a bit like bullying: research has worked put the it is not just the bully and his/her victim that are the problem: it is the bystanders who do nothing. They effectively ENABLE bullying. Same with racism. ",
