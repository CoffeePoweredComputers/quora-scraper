            "answer_text": "Space exploration at the top end of the political spectrum use to be focused on the pure science and the possible return on investment. Bear in mind that even nickle invested in the NASA moon and shuttle projects have long since paid forthemselves in increases in technical knowledge and consumer products. The handheld calculator, desk top computer, consumer electronics are all the result of these projects. Future space exploration COULD result in asteroid mining, colonies, mass migration and improved medical treatments for everyone. We must always remember that Earth itself is just the nursery for humanity, just as we migrated out of the cradle of Africa, we must migrate of planet, or die when the next extinction event occurs and it will occur. The anti-space movement, conservationists, earth firsters and other mental midgets will be the death of the species. ",

            "answer_text": "Since the Cold War was a struggle in which both sides wanted to emerge triumphant without ever getting into an actual war, both sides tried to find other ways of \"beating\" each other. This was clearly manifested in the Space Race. In those days, NASA's mission was, in many ways, a military mission - part of a war of information and attitudes. We have not yet gone to Mars not because we cannot, but because we do not feel the need to get there before some great imposing enemy. The political climate can change, though. A new Space Race could emerge much like the old one, with countries trying to prove their superiority. Maybe the EU, Japan, India, and even countries like Brazil and Mexico will become major players in space. Who knows? ",
