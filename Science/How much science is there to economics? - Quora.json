Using the four elements to define a paradigm of science, economics can be said to have gone through 3 paradigms, the last being brand new. The classical paradigm was sound ontologically (had real facts of the market under study), and correct methodology. But its causal explanation relied on natural law that actually does not work in the economy. The classical paradigm is reworked by changing natural law into institutional law to create consistent economics as the third and most recent paradigm. In the interim, neoclassical economics came with a complete failure on all counts. It lacks ontological validity by applying hypothesis in place of observed fact. Its epistemology does not exist: it does not care about explaining any reality in terms of necessity and sufficiency of causation. Its methodology is anti-scientific hypothesis mongering. Its rhetoric is mathematical tautology. I do challenge everybody to refute the consistent paradigm that I claim is a science while neoclassical economics (the prevailing mainstream) is not science.

The claims of economic knowledge are under dispute. There is a crisis of faith. The question is: is there an economic science that people can believe in? To judge whether there is one, the scientist would apply the standards of science provided by the philosophy of science. In the present exercise, there are four standards of science: ontology, epistemology, methodology, and rhetoric. First, ontology asks whether there is such a thing as an economic reality, and if it exists, what its existential character is. Secondly, epistemology asks about the causality of the reality: why the reality is what it is rather than otherwise. Thirdly, methodology shows how the causality works to determine the character of reality. Lastly, rhetoric guides how to present the scientific knowledge convincingly to people so that there is no dispute. Physicist Thomas Kuhn (1962) popularized the idea that scientific thinking goes through paradigms. It is an exemplar set by some influential scientists whose example serves as the source of guidance for others. Instead of progressing through incremental additions to a pre-existing stock of knowledge, Kuhn found that the historical progress of science seemingly went through discontinuous jumps from one paradigm to another. While historical narratives might use the notion of paradigm to sort various strands of thought, it would not be of much help to a philosophical narrative to assess the scientific merit of various themes. Hence, instead of taking Kuhn\u2019s example of the \u2018Structure of scientific revolution (1962/1970)\u2019, this author adopts Bertrand Russell\u2019s \u2018History of Western Philosophy (1945)\u2019 as a model for an assessment of the scietific merit of economic ideas. The popular term paradigm has been used in the present exercise to indicate a grouping of ideas according to the four standards of science. The summary of the review is that there was a classical paradigm of economic science that successfully met the ontological, methodological, and rhetorical standards but failed the epistemological standard. There was a neoclassical paradigm that failed all four standards. The exercise then proposes a third paradigm called consistent economics. It rebuilds the classical paradigm by adopting a new epistemology in place of the failed classical epistemology. This new paradigm meets all four standards of science. A changed epistemology changes the totality of the science so thoroughly that despite convergence in ontology, methodology, and rhetoric, it may appear dramatically different. For example, a shanty made of bamboo pillars, with the roof made of straw and leaves, and with walls made of jute is a house alright. But a modern skyscraper made of pillars of steel, walls of reinforced concrete, and a spine made of electrical lines and plumbing and fitted with all modern amenities like elevators is also a house, but is very different in look. In the end, the two houses differ: the skyscraper is more advanced than the shanty. The goal of this exercise is to present a newly rebuilt economic science (a skyscraper) that keeps just nothing of neoclassical economics (thin hot air), but keeps some core elements of classical economics (rebuilt pillars, walls, roofs). Its principal distinction is the epistemological discovery of an institutional law of exchange that determines how exchange occurs in reality the way it does rather than otherwise. It is stronger and more complete and more compact. And it comes in one piece as a single equation of exchange. One equation in three dimensions and four layers captures all economic realities. The adoption of the institutional law of exchange compels the new paradigm to adopt a new theory of human choice. The choice is consistent with the institutional rules of conduct regarding exchange. Consistent choice supersedes rational choice in search of super-optimal gains from trade that occur by defeating rational optimization. Consistent choice degenerates into rational choice when society disappears along with the social rules of conduct. Outside society, a solitary individual is compelled by natural law of subsistence (that may be said to operate as if by rational optimization). The institutional law of exchange forbids the natural license of the strong predator to kill/plunder the weak prey. It imposes the social mandate to pay the seller. Consistent economics therefore is bound to articulate a new theory of payment to show how money and bond serve as means of payment to fulfill the claims and obligations of the sellers and buyers of traded goods. It also must articulate a new theory of intermediation to show how intermediaries reduce transaction costs below that which original producers and ultimate consumers must incur. It also must develop a new theory of welfare to show how the individuals achieve gains from knowledge, trade, arbitrage, and seigniorage. It must perforce build a new theory of price to show how the market price must necessarily be larger than the producer\u2019s marginal cost and smaller than the consumer\u2019s marginal benefit, at the same time also allowing for an arbitrage margin for the intermediary. All in all, it is a theory of trade covering all possible regimes of trade: direct, indirect, and intertemporal and its degeneration into no trade. For policy, consistent economics offers clear guidance to use money as the tool to manage claims and obligations and to prevent their distortion. It shows how to find the exact equilibrium quantity of money corresponding to indirectly traded goods that cannot be paid for without money. Policy can avoid both inflation and unemployment by keeping the money supply close to its equilibrium, and by resorting to short circulation of money in place of the prevailing long circulation. Consistent economics does not ever require any reference to the subjective state of mind of the individual, particularly because trade necessarily requires the buyer and the seller to have precisely opposite preference orders over the same pair of traded goods. Social choice is necessarily intransitive. Consistent ontology of economics does not allow making any hypothesis. Its epistemology seeks certainty and forbids any mention of probability. But it explains every economic issue with one equation of exchange obeying one law of exchange, without much room for doubt or debate. The challenge for the future economist is to assess the consistent paradigm. In particular, the challenge is to see if institutional law of exchange provides a better explanation of economic reality than natural law does. Neoclassical economics has no hope of resurrection in any form or in any manner. In practical matters, a knowledgeable science is the source of guidance to fruitful policy application. The future generations may embark on figuring out the application of the new science to solve real life problems with assured success. Empirical studies of concrete current realities may help find current estimates of parameters for policy design, but those are not supposed to discover causalities. The abstract theory of exchange may be applied to concrete current realities for policy success. 2\tFour standards of science Broadly, the job of science is to explain reality so that people know why the reality is what it is rather than being otherwise. Many realities do not need special efforts to understand because there is no puzzle. Nobody is surprised that every human has two legs. They just take it for granted that it is the very nature of man to have two legs. But puzzles arise when the facts seem to vary, and people are baffled because what they expect is often not what they experience. The challenge of science is to pierce the fog of illusion that distorts the perception of reality. The toughest challenge is to survive the poison of intuition that lures the head into false conception. Indeed, intuition is an idea that occurs without disciplined thinking. Science has to furnish an explanation that overcomes illusion and unthinking intuition to resolve paradoxes. When reality is different from what it appears to be (owing to distortion by illusion), and when its meaning eludes the mind (owing to lazy intuition), paradoxes escape detection. Science must laboriously cultivate knowledge according to the grammar of knowing to avoid illusion (misperception) and intuition (misconception) beneath the paradox. The work of a scientist may be divided into four aspects. Ontology tries to establish the identity and character of the reality to be studied. Epistemology deals with the discovery of the causal law that explains why the reality is what it is. Methodology is a device to work out the details of how the causal law operates to determine the character of the reality. It requires an analytical tool to analyze the reality. Lastly, rhetoric is a manner of communicating the knowledge to persuade the audience that the reality has now been explained. A philosopher may judge the merit of scientific work according to the standards of ontology, epistemology, methodology, and rhetoric. 2.1\tEconomic ontology 2.1.1\tA standard of realism: The philosopher begins with the axiom that a reality exists outside the head, and independently of whatever idea about it may reside inside the head (as a preconception). This helps set a standard of realism. The point of this standard is that no scientific knowledge is possible without a knowable objective reality that exists outside the head. Knowledge of course resides inside the head. The key problem is to check if the idea inside the head corresponds to the reality outside the head. Ontology deals with the existence of the reality outside the head. Epistemology deals with the correspondence between the outside reality and its image (conception) inside the head. The human head is fond of creating imaginations inside the head without an external reality corresponding to it. Thus poet Sukumar Roy could very well draw the picture of an imaginary \u2018weep-saur\u2019, which is a weeping dinosaur with the face of human baby, and with two wings made of panels of dog-tails that would not launch it into air despite vigorous wagging (and hence the weeping). To imagine is to create an image of what does not exist outside the head. Ontology categorically forbids imagination (hypothesis). It mandates that the philosopher shall deploy the sense organs to gather information on the occurrences outside the head. But since sense organs are notorious for misperception, being vulnerable to all kinds of illusions, the philosopher follows certain principles to ascertain the error-free observation of the facts. A fact is a description of what exists outside the head independently of thought. Methodology is the device to get the correct observation, and describe and analyze it correctly. Epistemology is a device to assure the correctness of the correspondence between \u2018the reality\u2019 outside and \u2018the thought\u2019 inside the head. One standard of realism is objectivity attested by the corroboration of many observers. This fulfills the social base of support for science: anybody who wants to learn about the reality is bound to come up with the same description. If different people cannot agree on what is out there, no shared knowledge is possible. The object remains the same regardless of the observer. Objectivity satisfies the ontological standard while subjectivity fails. Subjectivity means that the observer creates the image inside his head regardless of the object outside. The same thing is seen and described and interpreted differently by the subjects (=observers). 2.1.2\tObjectivity in realism: There is a major weakness of corroboration. If several people all use the same faulty instrument of measurement, and agree on an incorrect reading, the science will provisionally accept a faulty reading. Thankfully, later generations may devise a better instrument and amend the reading. Hence a pragmatic formula is to accept corroboration as a provisional finding. No claim of absolute truth is possible: only provisional knowledge is possible. In social sciences, the corroboration may be a major disability. Many people may agree on a common misunderstanding (called sympathetic understanding) to support some intuition. Thus, crowds may agree that the so-called law of diminishing marginal utility makes sense. This is not based on objective observation and has no meaning, because this alleged law is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain any part of exchange. Thus, commercial producers and merchants disregard the marginal utility as they do not consume the goods they produce and sell. In a similar manner, all people except Copernicus may suffer from the illusion that the earth is still while the sun is moving. The popularity of an idea has no merit as science. Subjectivism has served as the road to shared misunderstanding and superstition by appealing to vulgar intuition. The art of cheating (and teaching) can thrive because lazy intuition can be readily exploited to plant false beliefs. A skeptic can escape the falsehoods by asking for objective evidence. Beyond ontology, one also needs the epistemological assurance of necessity and sufficiency to escape the lure of falsehood. Increasingly sophisticated instruments of observation and measurement have helped natural sciences reach a high point of accuracy and precision in description, free from the flaws of naked sense organs liable to illusion. Sadly, social sciences have not been lucky enough to find tools to overcome errors of intuition. Philosophers may hope that someday, people will be able to apply rigorous discipline of thinking (logic) to evade the treachery of lazy intuition. 2.1.3\tUniversality in realism: Another related standard of realism is universality. If a fact occurs only once, those who are not present in that place at that time of occurrence cannot observe it. Such a fact cannot be a subject of shared knowledge. The fact must be universal for science. It means that the entity must occur at all times and in all places so that whoever wants to observe it can observe it. A historical fact is not amenable to science just because it fails to be independently observed. History cannot yield scientific knowledge. 2.1.4\tThe Law of Identity The possibility of science rests on the operation of the law of identity. It is the highest of all laws: all identical entities behave identically. Science becomes useful as it can predict with certainty that something must behave identically to that previously observed (without error) in an identical instance. For example, a human face occupies space. This is filled with various parts. A particular arrangement of parts constitutes a structure. The human face has a structure. The nose is located at its center. Above the nose is a brow ridge, and above that a forehead. On two sides of the nose are two eyes. Next to the eye is a cheek, and next to the cheek is an ear, on both sides of the nose. Beneath the nose is an upper lip, below which lies a mouth opening, below which there is a lower lip and a chin. And so on. Science is possible if every possible instance of the human face has the identical facial structure. There must be some kind of law of physiognomy that ensures that every possible human face has the same structure. Without this identity one would never be able to predict where the eyes would be. If the structure of the face was not subject to a law, who knows whether one would have eyes beneath the armpit while another would have the nose below the knee? No knowledge would be possible then. The existence of the law governing the structure of an entity means that there is no randomness at all: all are predictable with certainty. This certainty of prediction makes science possible and useful. An object that endures through time may go through a sequence. A particular sequence of occurrences constitutes a causal chain of events. Science is useful as it can assure what (consequence) must come after some event. The spatial structure and the temporal sequence together constitute the character of the object. Science must first establish the character of the entity, and then discover the causal law that ensures the presence of the character. This then becomes the subject of epistemology, which identifies a law that makes the character identical in every instance of occurrence. The correspondence between the thing outside and the thought inside the head is established by a causal connection. This means that the task of ontology is to establish the identity of the subject of study. The identity of something makes it amenable to a precise definition. The philosopher must be able to define the subject of study of the particular science. For example, no science of herpetology is possible if one has no idea what a snake is, and ends up dissecting a frog, but describes it as a snake. Sadly, this kind of faulty exercise fills the literature of economics. For example, billions of people over centuries of time talked about price without bothering to define price, coming up with an absurd term called nominal price. Nominal price cannot possibly exist: it is an unthinking intuition of lazy people unwilling to think. Every observed price is a ratio of the amount of payment to the amount of the object, even if the payment is money. The monetary price is a relative price (relative to money), and is not nominal. 2.1.5\tA Standard of definition: To build a science of the economy, ontology provides the guidance to start with a definition of the economy as a real objective entity (rather than a figment of imagination such as Utopia). A definition specifies the identity by identifying a genus and a differentium. The definition must identify the essence of the entity. The essence is the necessary and sufficient elements that must be present to constitute the entity. The fundamental problem of ontology is to extract the essence by filtering out the accidental elements that may be present without being necessary or being sufficient. For example, salt may be present in naturally occurring water, but the presence of salt is neither necessary nor sufficient to constitute water. Thus, water may exist even if there is no salt in it. And water may not exist even if there is salt. Hence the definition of water must exclude salt (and any other accidental elements) for being unnecessary and insufficient. Example: A definition of the economy If there is to be an economic science, there must be an economy out there outside the economist\u2019s head, regardless of whether the economist observes it or not, or understands it or not. The economy can be a subject of science if it can be ascertained to have a character in respect of the essential elements of its existence or occurrence. The economy keeps working the way it does regardless of what the economist may think (but not regardless of what he may do). One possible way to see the economy is to see it as a sphere of livelihood. In such a sphere, the means of livelihood are produced and consumed. There are two possible species of the spheres of livelihood: (1) the natural ecology, and (2) the manmade economy. That is, the economy is a species of a sphere of livelihood, but is different from the ecology as the other species. In the natural ecology, living organisms must procure the means of livelihood to stay alive. Plants procure them in one manner, and animals do it in another. Animals procure means of livelihood by foraging, which includes hunting and gathering. As human beings are natural hunters and gatherers, the primal fact of hunting and gathering needs serious attention. One form of hunting involves plunder (fraud, theft, and robbery) of wealth. In the ecology, murder of the prey is the natural mode of production. Production by murder and plunder occurs in the ecology. Nature allows the strong hunter to kill and eat the weak prey without any question of paying the prey. In the ecology, there is natural plunder and murder without resistance and without payment. The economy differs from the ecology in respect of plunder. Human beings seem to be the only beings capable of organizing resistance against plunder, and to create organized institutions to forbid plunder and mandate payment. Payment occurs in the economy but not in the ecology. The definition of the economy then identifies the essence of the economy: it is a sphere where production and consumption of means of livelihood occur, and it is where exchange with payment occurs but plunder does not. The existence of payment is essential to constitute the economy, in addition to the existence of the acts of livelihood (production and consumption). Human beings evolved in the natural ecology and procured their means of livelihood naturally by hunting and gathering. Genetically evolved as determined killers, humans engaged in an orgy of cannibalism. Biological cannibalism involves killing and eating a member of the same species, namely one man eating another man. This happened to a small degree. The cannibalism among man is mainly economic cannibalism: one man eating the wealth of another by way of plunder. The other fact of human civilization is the relentless resistance against plunder. Through about ten thousand years of organized resistance, human societies have created institutions to forbid plunder and to mandate payment. Some amount of plunder still occurs. This lapse of institutional rules is a subject of economic policy. The key goal of economic policy is to prevent the disintegration of the economy of payment into the ecology of plunder. Human resistance against plunder repudiates the natural law of subsistence of the hunters who naturally subsist by murder and plunder. This primordial fact calls for the recognition of institutional rules as the explanatory agendum in social science. This makes the cleanest distinction between natural and social science. Natural science applies natural law to study the mechanical behaviour of inert objects. Social science applies institutional law to study the teleological actions of alert agents. The definition of an economy as distinct from ecology shows the differentium as exchange with payment. Production and consumption are generic elements that are present in both the economy and the ecology. But the two species differ: the ecology allows plunder while the economy bans it and mandates payment. 2.1.6\tMathematics sabotages ontology The arithmetic core of mathematics is self-referential truism without any relation to external reality. This disables mathematics from being a tool of scientific investigation either for ontological existence of reality or for epistemological causality of the correspondence between reality and its conceptual theory. The statement [2+2=4] is a definitional truism or tautology that has no empirical meaning. It has no reference to facts of observation independently of the arithmetic definition of numbers. The number 4 is defined such that it is always the same thing as (1+1+1+1)=(1+1) + (1+1)=2+2 or as (1)+(1+1+1)=1+3 or as (1+1+1+1+1)- 1= 5-1=4. It is the same information presented in multiple expressions of the same definition of 4. In arithmetic, if a cow can fly 735 miles an hour, then the cow can fly 1470 miles in 2 hours. This is a meaningless and absurd truism because there is no real cow that can fly. If a mathematician believes that \u2018a dollar is a dollar is a dollar\u2019, he will massacre science. A dollar earned is causally different from a dollar spent. The behaviour of a dollar earned is very different from that of a dollar spent. The scientist will have to know that \u2018this dollar\u2019 is not \u2018that dollar\u2019. A mathematician will be hugely baffled that 12 O\u2019clock (of the day) + 12 hours gives 12 O\u2019clock (of the night) so that [+12=0]. Again 12 O\u2019clock (of the day) - 12 hours gives 12 O\u2019clock (of the night) so that [-12=0]. Hence [+12=0=-12]. He cannot figure out how 12 O\u2019clock is different from 12 O\u2019clock. The wall clock uses a circle which has no beginning and no end: the same point is both the beginning and the end, both the minimum and the maximum at once. On the wall clock, 2 O\u2019clock occurs both 10 hours before 12 O\u2019clock and 2 hours after 12 O\u2019clock. This clock is intransitive. The hands of the clock do not make transits: they come back to where the start from. A mathematician cannot grasp how in an exchange between (x, y), John prefers y to x at the same time as Ken prefers x to y, so that there is no socially transitive preference order. A mathematician will be at wit\u2019s end to find out that intransitivity of social choice is a necessary condition for exchange to occur. If both John and Ken prefer x to y, none will sell x in exchange for y, and none will buy y in exchange for x. For x to be traded against y, the owner of x must prefer y to x, while the owner of y must prefer x to y at the same time. Intransitivity means that measurement is impossible. And without measurement, one cannot figure out how something is maximum or minimum. It will be a shock to recognize that neither utility (benefit) nor cost can be measured socially. The whole idea of optimization is impossible to apply as cost minimization and benefit maximization cannot be measured owing to intransitivity: x is more costly than y (for buyer Ken) and x is also less costly than y (for seller John); x is more beneficial than y (to buyer Ken) and x is also less beneficial than y (to seller John), as John is not Ken. The idea that rational optimizers minimize the cost of production and maximize the benefit of consumption is entirely meaningless. It is just the restatement of the definition of rational optimization. It has no implication on any reality. It is a self-referential circularity. Even as every producer minimizes production cost, the cost incurred by one producer is objectively different from that of another. It is just as every runner has two legs and yet they run at very different speeds. That each runner runs at maximum speed has no meaning, because the maximum is defined internally, without external ontological reference. To an external observer, only one out of the thousands of runners attains the maximum speed. Mathematics uses statements like \u2018if x, then y\u2019. These are forbidden in science. The statement in science must be \u2018as x so must y\u2019. \u2018As x\u2019 must be a statement of observed fact. Thus a scientist is not allowed to say: if a cow can fly, then it will fly. He must say \u2018as a cow does not fly, so it must not fly.\u2019 The idea of numerical identity is the principal tool to massacre science. The idea of a representative individual in any social science is murderous. Thus if there are numerous individuals each of whom produces what he consumes, and consumes what he produces, the collection of the isolated individuals does not constitute a society, just as a collection of billions of identical grains of sand in a heap does not make a sand society. To make society, each must be associated with the others in some kind of dependency relation so that something done by one man affects what is done by another man. Only if man is different from woman can a reproductively successful family be formed. No real family can be formed by marrying man to man or woman to woman. A man never represents a woman and vice-versa. A representative agent is a barren transvestite who does not create or perpetuate a society at all. A society cannot exist without mutually dependent non-representative individuals. A wrangler of math may never see why a statement D(x)=S(x) saying that demand for x is equal to supply of x has no meaning. Demand for x is not just a number. It is a phenomenon that has a numerical magnitude, but has many more things. Demand for x cannot occur without the supply of y in its payment from the buyer of x. Supply of x cannot occur without the corresponding demand for the payment y payable to the seller of x. Beneath the surface phenomenon of buying and selling x, there is production and consumption of x, and the abortion of production and commencement of purchase by one, and the abortion of consumption and commencement of sale by another agent. Even if it is true that production of x (by John) is 5, consumption of x (by Ken) is 5, demand (purchase) of x (made by Ken) is 5, and supply (sale) of x (made by John) is 5, it still does not mean that demand is supply, or that production is consumption. Math cannot keep them separate and related: it is apt to mix them up. The definition of demand for x is the quantity of x that the buyer is able and willing to buy. The supply of x is the quantity the seller is able and willing to sell. Now, as the demand for x is 5 bananas, and the supply of x is 5 bananas too, the equation [D(x)=S(x)]=[5 bananas= 5 bananas] assures only that the output (the quantity traded) is 5 bananas. It has simply no way to give the price of bananas. The idea that equality of demand and supply gives the equilibrium (determinate) price is thoroughly absurd. But a wrangler of a math does not see this at all. The problem is that math carries no sense of the reality of price. In reality, it is an expression of the object to object relation. The price is the amount of payment per unit of the traded object. As x=5 bananas is sold against a payment in y=15 berries, the price of x is (15 berries/ 5 bananas)= 3 berries/banana. It is a ratio. The price of banana is the quantity of berries per banana. In [D(x)=S(x)], there are no berries (y) and hence the equation cannot determine the ratio (y/x). A scientist will write three equations to simultaneously determine three variables all at once: (x, y, y/x). D(x)=S(x) will determine (x); D(y)=S(y) will determine y, and the social law of equivalence stated as V(x)=V(y) will determine (y/x). The social law is that the buyer must pay the seller with a payment whose value is precisely equal to the value of what he buys. The buyer and the seller reach the agreement that the value of 5 bananas is equal to that of 15 berries, written as V(5 bananas)=V(15 berries). That agreement defines 3 berries per banana as the agreed (equilibrium) price of banana. One cannot get a solution of the ratio (y/x) without an equation in which both x and y are present. Although it may appear as a definitional truism that the price of x is the quantity of y per unit of x, it is not derived from a concoction inside the head without reference to the external world of reality. There is indeed a society out there, with courts and police and prisons to ensure that Ken cannot leave with x=5 bananas without paying John with y=15 berries exactly, no more, and no less. The price (y/x) is not a mere definition: it is an objective reality sanctioned and enforced by society. Math does not see why axis reversal is forbidden by ontology. If one formulates a demand function in which x=D(p), that is, x is determined by p by the functional rule D(.), it is not legitimate to say that therefore p is determined by x. Axis reversal converts x=D(p) into its inverse p=D-1(x). If demand is defined correctly as the quantity the buyer buys, then equality of demand and supply cannot give anything but the quantity of x. But when the causality is illegitimately reversed so that (inverse) demand is price p=D-1(x), and (inverse) supply is price p=S-1(x), one reaches the patently absurd idea that equality of demand and supply gives price. Inversion of the function is a perversion of ontology. The problem is the arrogance of a wrangler. Instead of writing all three equations, he writes just one equation, and calls it partial equilibrium. In reality, nothing can occur partially. Ontologically, partial equilibrium is impossible. The courts want the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Partial equilibrium is not the truth, not the whole truth, and is anything but the truth. One of course hopes that when science shows how realities can be symbolically expressed as equations, math will no longer write imaginary equations. But then one will have to attain much better literacy than mere numeracy. For example, a literate economist will never attempt to write a utility function to explain purchase (=demand), because the purchaser tries to reduce cost rather than increase utility. A purchaser need not even consume the purchased good, as he may sell it again. The ability to read reality will show that regardless of how much utility one might get from consuming 5 bananas he purchased (and he may not consume it), his problem was to choose between producing the bananas versus purchasing them. He buys the bananas rather than produce them because his cost of purchase is lower than his cost of production. Utility is not involved in this buying decision. A mathematician may be baffled that the determination of the quantity of purchase (5 bananas) occurs in a single dimension of utility between fewer or more bananas, namely, that the issue is why buy 5 bananas rather than 4 or 6? He is sadly mistaken. Any exchange decision involves three dimensions of value, payment, and welfare. A one-dimensional study is bound to give a wrong answer. A scientist will try to understand all three equations [S(x)=D(x); S(y)=D(y); and V(x)=V(y)] and will explore the agent to agent, object to object, and the agent to object relations. The scientist will answer why Ken would buy rather than produce the 5 bananas, and also explain why Ken would buy 5 bananas rather than fewer or more. A mathematician tends to lose track in a multi-track reality, as the same good involves different costs and different benefits between different agents. The invasion of numeracy devoid of literacy is the biggest threat to economics and all other social sciences. Here is a sad example. There was a highly literate Gary Stanley Becker who could read (before others could) that in the reality of fertility decline, there was a switch from a large number of low quality children to a small number of high quality children. This great scholar seemingly felt unsure of his numeracy skills. So he took Greg Lewis as a co-author for his article \u2018On the interaction between quality and quantity of children.\u2019 (Becker and Lewis, 1973) Becker could surely send his message in plain old English with great lucidity and conviction. He could deliver the shining gem without the horror of math. Sadly, he must have felt some pressure to use math. It ought to have been a pretty simple exercise that high school seniors could do. Let L denote the number of low-skill children, and H denote the number of high-skill children. Let \uf061 denote the ratio of qualities such that \uf061L=H with \uf061>1. Then write a budget as [C=cL*L+cH*H] where (cL, cH) are the marginal costs of raising children. Then write a demand function for children in terms of the benefits (wL, wH) such as the marginal lifetime wages earned by the children to maximize wage income [W=wL*L+wH*H]. It is pretty simple to apply the standard optimization technique to demonstrate the substitution between H and L in favour of more H at the cost of less L. Any external shock that makes the ratio [(wH/cH)>(wL/cL)] will show a substitution in favour of H. A literate economist could readily read that education makes the worker more productive (raises wH) and hence leads to a choice in favour of H as long as the marginal cost of education does not exceed the marginal productivity of education. Strangely, with the support of Lewis, the great scholar was dragged down to the muddy level of math. Why would anybody decide that children should be represented as a product nq where n is the number and q is the quality of the children? Writing a budget equation proved to be beyond reach, especially as the authors failed to apply the product rule of derivative, ending with illegitimate division by zero. The absurd outcome was stated such as \u2018the cost of quality is more because it applies to more children.\u2019 It is absurd because the whole point of a budget is that to get more of q, one must have less of n. One cannot have more of both n and q in the same budget. Becker must have felt betrayed. Wounded by the stabbing of low quality math, he sought help. 15 years later, Robert Barro joined him to write a reformulation (See Becker and Barro 1988). This time, the authors decided that altruistic parents cared about the quality of their children, but the grandchild\u2019s quality affected the child\u2019s quality so that there was a dynastic utility function. Writing a budget for an infinite number of generations proved to be a very simple trick. Parents just borrowed money from unborn future progeny to educate themselves, thereby making themselves rich enough to finance the education of themselves, and their children and the successive generations. All of these fell from the fertile head of the mathematician who had simply no sense of the reality of fertility decline or no sense of what \u2018quality of children\u2019 might practically mean. Only math is able to find quality of children in the quality of the children\u2019s children, though yet unborn. One of the most competent mathematicians was Paul Samuelson. If he wanted to read reality, he could. Thus he could take data on factor prices, say wages of workers of traded goods across the world at two points of time, say between 1920 and 1940. If the data revealed the reality that factor prices were becoming equalized (were converging), then he could look for causal factors that were both necessary and sufficient to determine the convergence. But without reading any data, without any proof of factor price equalization, without any mechanism to equalize the unequal, he just produced a theorem, all from inside his head. His famous model of trade has no trade in it, just a single world that produced and consumed everything. It was a pure allocation model of one agent, and could not have more than one price for any factor to begin with. The model produces a factor price that always is the same by definition: the price that is equal to marginal cost of factor reproduction, and also equal to the marginal productivity of the factor. There is simply no meaning of the term equalization without showing that factor prices were unequal at one point of time and then became equal later, by virtue of trade. The model has no trade so that there is really no way to show what trade does to factor prices. The proper role of math is to be a slave of science to carry the discovery in unambiguous symbols. It cannot discover anything. Consistent economics shows how to use math legitimately as bearers of message, and not as discoverers. It adamantly enforces slavery of math and staunchly denounces dictatorship of math. 2.2\tEconomic epistemology 2.2.1\tA standard of causality: Epistemology sets the standard of scientific knowledge. By virtue of the law of identity, all identical instances of an entity behave identically. This is because there is some law that imposes the identity on the character of the entity. The job of epistemology is to assess whether there is knowledge of causality of the character of something. A statement constitutes knowledge if it identifies the law that generates the character of the phenomenon. The difference between a fact of observation and knowledge is that knowledge involves thinking such that the fact is related to other facts by way of causation. Knowledge resides inside the head by virtue of thinking without which the causal connection is not intelligible. For example, let the observed fact be that John has sold object x to Ken, who has given a payment y to John. This fact in itself has no causal meaning. A goat that watches this fact may not understand what it means. Science adds causal meaning to the fact to turn it into knowledge called theory. That is, a theory is a scientific proposition that has added causal meaning to a fact of observation. Whether a statement constitutes knowledge is then ascertained by epistemology according to whether a causal explanation has been provided by a law of causation. Economic science must add meaning to the fact of exchange to explain exchange. In the minimalist definition of exchange, two agents (John j, Ken k) give and take two objects (say x=5 bananas, y=15 berries). Then there are three relations: between the two objects (x, y); between the two agents (j, k); and between the object and the agent: between j and (x, y), and between k and (x, y). Each relation requires an explanation as to why the relation is what it is rather than otherwise. Thus economic science must explain why the quantities of x and y are what they are rather than more or less. Then it must also explain why John sells x rather than some other kind of good to Ken, and why Ken pays John rather than somebody else. Lastly, the science must explain why Ken would buy x rather than produce it, and John would sell x rather than consume it. In addition, it must explain why Ken would pay John rather than rob him and vice-versa. Why would John not be paid by Ken if John does not give x to Ken? How is something explained? It is explained by identifying a causal law that governs how it happens. Thus, Ken does not rob John because there is a society that prohibits it on penalty. The identification of the social law that prohibits robbing and mandates paying constitutes the explanation. Philosophers have articulated two broad laws of causation. These are known as mechanism and teleology. These are generally mutually contradictory. Almost all debates in philosophy involve the contradiction between the casual laws. Philosophers have sadly cultivated an obstinacy called the universe. A universe consists of all instances of something that carries the same verse (causal principle). One group believes that all things in the cosmos obey the verse of mechanism. The oposite camp thinks that all things act according to the verse of teleology. An inert object has no life and no volition. It does not act according to an internal impulse. It passively reacts to an external stimulus. The pattern of reaction to external stimuli constitutes a mechanism. Under the identical stimulus, the object reacts identically. A natural mechanical law governs how it reacts. The knowledge of the behavior of the inert object then consists of the knowledge of the mechanism according to which its reactions constitute a definite and predictable pattern. For example, an apple falls to the ground according to the mechanistic law of gravitation. A scientist who sees an apple falling not only observes the fact, but also understands why the apple fell towards the earth rather than fly towards the sky or in any other manner. It fell to the earth because it had to fall to the earth: it could not fall in any other way. Knowledge goes beyond the fact and connects the fact to its causal relations with other facts. Thus, one would also know that had the apple been the planet Jupiter, the earth would fall towards the apple (=Jupiter), as bigger objects attract smaller ones more forcefully. Teleology refers to an alert agent who is not an inert object. An agent has a telos (purpose) from the inside. Thus a live cat sitting somewhere may suddenly decide to take a walk without any change in the outside. It acts according to an internal impulse of telos. An explanation of a deliberate action refers to a telos as its reason. An example of a teleological explanation is that a man furls an umbrella above his head, because he has the telos of getting shaded from the rays of the sun or the drops of the rain. Thus, teleology identifies an internal reason for some pro-active performance of action by an alert agent, while mechanism identifies an external cause for a passive reaction of an inert object. Cause is mechanical, but reason is teleological. Object behavior is mechanical, but agent action is teleological. Teleology (in its primitive version) earned a bad name as it ended up as the grandmother of all superstitions. This occurred because teleology of the unthinking crowds violates the ontology of objectivity. Superstition conjures up a telos internally, without reference to the outside reality, without evidence. Russell (1945) had good reason to lament that teleology led science up a blind alley. This author proposes a solution of philosophical obstinacy in two steps. The first is the doctrine of diversity. This doctrine says that the cosmos consists of diverse kinds of realities: the so-called universe is not a universe, but is a diverse. It has at least two different realms. One is the mechanistic realm of inert objects governed by natural law. The other is the teleological realm of alert agents who act according to definite institutional laws. The big twist with institutional law is that the presence of such a law can be ascertained objectively. For example, one institutional law is that the buyer must pay the seller. One does not need to peek into the state of mind of the buyer to see if the buyer is willing or not willing to make the payment. The buyer\u2019s obligation to pay exists regardless of the state of the mind of the buyer. Hence institutional law can be teleological without being subjective. The biggest surprise is that the institutional law of exchange (consisting of three rules governing three dimensions of exchange) is both necessary and sufficient to give rise to exchange with all its essential characters. It is an explanatory law: it explains the objectively observed character of exchange. In the end, the dictum of epistemology is to identify an explanatory law that governs the behaviour of the entity under study. The claim of knowledge is established by identifying the causal law that explains the behaviour of the entity. The knowledge of exchange is the knowledge of the law of exchange that determines the character of the exchange. Economic science is a science that knows why exchange happens the way it does rather than otherwise. 2.2.2\tStatistics sabotages epistemology Epistemology wants to find the cause of the fact with certainty, without any possibility of randomness. The cause cannot be random: it must be certain. The cause and the effect must both the indisputable facts of observation. And the causal relation between the two must be logically irrefutable. To make the facts indisputable, no statistical inference can be used, because it is the exact opposite of epistemology. By the ontological standard, even if 100% of the water sample has salt in it, salt is still not a part of water, but just an impurity. Salt can be removed from water without water ceasing to be water. There is no question of probability, such as the claim that water is probably made of salt. The poisonous idea of probability was offered to the mental derelicts that visited the casinos, got cheated, and then broke down in suicides and fatal brawls. The king had to threaten to close them down on account of the alleged unfairness leading to the decimation of the nobility addicted to gambling. Then several guys concocted the purely imaginary idea of probability. Let a gambling device called a die have six faces numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Let the six-faced die lie on a table with the faces as 6=top, 5=bottom, 4=west, 3=east, 2=north and 1=south. Then define a turn as one displacement of a face in any specified direction. One turn from the east to the west will make the faces change their direction. Now the post-turn face positions are 3=top, 4=bottom, 6=west, 5=east, 2=north and 1=south. Each turn (from east to west) changes four faces: top becomes west, west becomes bottom, bottom becomes east, and east becomes top. Next, define a toss as a specified series of turns. It should be obvious that a scientist can absolutely predict the direction of all six faces with 100% certainty as he must observe and control what he wants to know. Only absolute mental derelicts will suppose that one can know without observation and without control on the process of occurrence (such as the toss). A scientist can always, without fail pick up a 10 of hearts from a deck of 52 gambling cards, because he will correctly observe the cards and control his choice with no lack of care. It is quite absurd to suppose that since 1 out of the 6 faces will appear on top means that the ratio 1/6 is the probability. Probability does not exist. Had it existed, it had to be perceptible in the object itself independently of the toss. The theory of probability relies on example of gambling devices, and gamblers are the avowed enemies of science: they are determined not to know. They do not observe what they do, and certainly do not control what they do. Gut level appetite for jackpots lure them into the killing fields of casinos. Had there been any probability at work, over time, the earnings of the gamblers would be roughly equal to what they bet, and fair casinos would fairly earn an identical zero. The idea of probability is a hook and the promised winning is the bait to attract the mindless morons to the casinos and cheat them. The idea of probability cannot be separated from the math idea of fairness. A fair die is one which over time yields faces with the probability 1/6 for each of the six faces. This is counter-ontological. A fact exists independently of how it is defined or how one thinks about it. If a die is fair, the fairness has to be an attribute of the die independently of the toss. One must be able to detect the fairness before the die is tossed. But mathematics defines it circularly: a die is fair if it yields faces with a probability of 1/6, and that 1/6 is the probability if the die is fair. This abstract issue may use an example to make it easier to grasp. The cause must be able to exist independently of the effect, and separately from it so that the occurrence of the cause is a distinct fact than the occurrence of the effect. For example, a relatively large quantity of water poured on a small fire will extinguish the fire, but a relatively small amount of water poured on a large fire will evaporate the water rather than extinguish the fire. The water must exist independently of the fire and vice-versa. If a gambler\u2019s die is fair, it must remain fair even if it is not tossed, and if probability is a fact, it must occur even if the die is not fair. But probability theory is circular: fairness is defied in terms of probability, which in turn is defined in terms of fairness. It is just a rewording of the same imagination. Subject to error-free observation and flawless control, there is no reality of probability at all. Hence science cannot permit any mention of probability or any kind of inference related to it. To lure, dupe, and stupefy the greedy morons, professional cheats have always used the fantasy of fantastic winnings to rob the derelicts. The term probability came into use when mathematicians cooked up the absurdity. Smart people have good practical (pragmatic) reason to use a kind of law of large number. For example the number of people arriving at the Peter Pan bus terminal at New York to go to Boston at any point of time is not a random number, but is a certain determinate number. The problem in practice is that the bus company cannot hire 150,000,000 callers to continuously call all potential travellers to know about their travel plans to exactly predict how many of them will arrive at the terminal at 2:35 PM on Friday. If they did, they could predict with great accuracy the number of travellers. But Peter Pan people are smart; they do not incur the cost of hiring those 150,000,000 callers to improve the accuracy. They rather tolerate a degree of inaccuracy so that sometimes the bus leaves with empty seats and sometimes, there are more passengers than the scheduled buses can carry. They use a rule of thumb. The law of large number is good enough to guide them in their bus scheduling. Using statistical inference will not give them any help at all. The point of this is that in reality, there is no probability, but certainty. But there is a cost of observation and control to reach the certainty. A small bit of accuracy comes at a large cost and it is not worth the cost. In practical matters, a degree of imperfection is sometimes better than perfection. Science of course is not about practice, but about knowledge. Give the scientist all the instruments to observe and control, and he can know with certainty. But he cannot get any help from dishonest conception of statistical inference. The idea of regression is dishonest. The sum of the deviations from the average is identically zero. One cannot have much fun with zero. But an intoxicated and dishonest man can get ecstatic joy by taking the squares of the deviations, effectively making the positive and the negative the same. If the sum of the deviations is zero, the sum of the squares should also be zero (for the idealized normal curve), but if one adds the squares, the square of the negative is positive and the square of the positive is positive so that the sum of square is non-zero. Thus if one takes a normal distribution, and honestly subtracts the sum of squares of the negative deviations from the sum of squares of the positive, the result is zero. It is dishonest to add the sums of squares of positives to those of negatives. Can a statistician develop a least square regression for a normal distribution in which the sum of squares of the negative errors is subtracted from the sum of squares of positive deviations? And why take the squares rather than cubes? Why not raise the deviation to the power 2.14214 or 7.463 et cetera? Or why not multiply or divide them rather than adding? There is nothing in nature to prove that nature minimizes the sum of squares. No amount of regression analysis based on the idea of minimum of sum of squares has ever predicted anything with any degree of accuracy. Wall Street firms lost many good billions of dollars by relying on a statistical expert (who won a famous prize for the analysis of the un-analyzable madness and cheating). Indeed, prediction is not a legitimate job of science. Its job is to discover causality, which is timeless. There is no option to wonder what will happen to unseen things. Statistical inference has no legitimacy. Responsible scientists do not and should not publicize the guess work they employ and test in the laboratories, because the ordinary public may mistake the pre-scientific investigation as science. There are endless unsolved mysteries in science, both natural and social. And no responsible scientist should feed the public with the uncooked vulgarities based on conjectures. There are good examples of science from the great masters. Who needs a so-called paradigm defined in terms of the vulgar standard of popularity? One could take Socrates and Russell to learn how to think systematically. One could take Galileo and Newton and Einstein to learn how to look at facts. One could see how Adam Smith and Thomas Robert Malthus organized their ideas to develop their arguments. But there is no one who could show how to make valid conjectures. Hypothesis belongs to one who is not yet an accomplished scientist and hence who has no right to be taken seriously. 2.3\tEconomic methodology 2.3.1\tA standard of essentialism Science must use the proper method of investigation. A cause is both necessary and sufficient to give rise to the cause. Methodology is the logic of the method to ascertain how necessity and sufficiency is to be analyzed and proved. The scientist must develop an analytical tool to ascertain the necessity and the sufficiency conditions. Science takes the facts and analyzes them to show how the facts obey the causal laws. An analytical tool applies the methodology. The philosopher\u2019s job is to assure the correctness and adequacy of the analytical tool. He wants to see if the method has valid logic. The dictum of essentialism is that the character must be defined to identify the entity in terms of necessary and sufficient elements (its essence) to constitute its character (structure and sequence). The same dictum imposes the mandate that the science must examine the reality in such a manner that anybody can go out and ascertain it in terms of necessity and sufficiency. This abstract concept can be brought within grasp by showing an example. In reality, an exchange is an event that occurs in a society composed of at least two different agents who are mutual strangers in the precise sense that they do not already co-own the objects of exchange. The object x belongs to John, and Ken is the other agent who does not already co-own x. For exchange to occur, the ownership over x is voluntarily ceded by John and acquired by Ken. However, Ken must pay John with y, which is owned by Ken and not by John, and to pay y to John is to cede Ken\u2019s ownership of y to John. The ownership of the objects undergoes change between the agents. To analyze exchange, the vector of objects (x, y) may be defined as an instance of exchange. This vector must be subjected to the operation of the law of exchange. For exchange to occur, the agents must have the freedom of enterprise (to buy and sell), being freed from the compulsion to produce what one consumes, and to consume what one produces. The exercise of this freedom must be meaningful. The human agents are entrepreneurs, and this means that the buyer buys the object rather than produce it because the buyer incurs a lower cost to procure it by purchase than by production. Likewise, the seller sells the object because he gets a larger benefit from sale than from consumption (through subsequent use of the payment). Without this freedom, no exchange can occur. The quantity of payment y is determinate and not random. It is not more than what it is because the buyer would not give any more. It is not less than what it is because the seller would not take any less. The agents conduct a bargain to reach an agreement on the quantities. This is governed by the social rule of equivalence. The value of the payment must be equal to the value of the object paid for. And then there is the rule of reciprocity. The buyer must pay the seller and nobody but the seller. The seller must get the payment from the buyer and from nobody but the buyer. To indicate that x goes from j to k, let it be symbolically shown as xjk. Likewise y is shown as ykj as it goes from Ken k to John j. Then the values of these objects are expressed as V(xjk)=pjk*xjk, and the value of ykj is V(ykj)=pkj*ykj. The rule of equivalence is shown as [pjk*xjk = pkj*ykj]. The rule of reciprocity is assured by the required opposition of the subscripts (jk|kj). The remaining task is to consider all possible contexts of exchange and explain every possible configuration of exchange. The equation of exchange can be explored in four layers of operation in three dimensions to study every possible economic event. Thus, the scientist needs to see each single object and apply the law of exchange to show how its quantity and its kind are determined. Then he must explore the relation between an object and its payment to show how two objects of different kinds attains the same value, and then how two objects of the same value must be of different kinds in terms of costs and benefits. Then one shows how each agent buys something and sells something to achieve budget balance and how all agents collectively buy and sell all objects. The three dimensions are explored in terms of quantity of the object (value in synthetic measure), kind of object (payment of one kind of thing by another kind of thing), and the welfare of the agent (who incurs a cost to produce or purchase the goods, and derives a benefit from consuming or selling the objects). In about forty years of exploration, in a draft of about 140000 words, this author has worked out how this analysis of exchange answers every question of economic science. The methodological illustration must insist that it must apply to facts. There is no room to explain imaginary scenarios. There is no room for hypothesis testing. Methodology does not discover anything, but shows what has been discovered by ontology (the real occurrence of exchange) and epistemology (the existence of an institutional law of exchange governing its occurrence). The notion of methodological individualism is an epistemological doctrine that social events can (and must) be explained by denying the existence of society, but by deriving social events from individual intentions. In the absence of society, there are no social rules. But without social rules to impose the obligation to pay, and enforce the claim to get payment, intention is not sufficient to lead to exchange. This is social instrumentalism: social rules as instruments to lead to social events. The rule of freedom of enterprise allows the individuals to pursue their intentions, but the rules of equivalence and reciprocity act as instruments to restrict (determine) the outcomes. Social events are determined (both necessarily and sufficiently) by social laws, and not by individual intentions without social laws. Indeed, exchange requires individuals to have opposite intentions regarding the same traded goods. Each individual traded good must be present in the analysis, as must each individual agent. Intentions exist but do not determine the exchange outcomes. The new meaning of methodological individualism is that each individual is different and hence cannot be represented by some proxy (representative individual). There is no representative individual in an economy. As a methodological tool, consistency analysis of exchange shows how the ontological character of the observed realities associated with exchange are governed by the epistemological identification of the law of exchange. The bulk of the work of what Kuhn called normal science is the application of the analytical method in the various contexts of exchange. To apply the method, the economist will study the object-object relation of value, agent-agent relation of payment, and agent-object relation of welfare at all four layers of one good, two goods, three goods, and all goods associated with one agent, two agents, three agents, and all agents to find out how the kinds and the quantities of the traded objects, and the incomes and expenditures of the trading agents are determined. 2.4\tEconomic rhetoric 2.4.1\tA standard of communication To fulfil the social duty to share knowledge, science must use rhetorical devices to communicate the knowledge and persuade the public that knowledge has been gained. Since a theory is (fact + meaning), the rhetorical exercise is (1) to show the character of the facts, and (2) to explain the logic of the causal meaning. The goal of rhetoric is to make people wise by helping them to observe and think correctly. Human language has a problem of vulgarity as it is used carelessly by unthinking people. Ordinary language has words whose meanings are ceaselessly stretched, twisted, distorted, and even reversed. Cheats play word games to stupefy people and manipulate them. Scientists use symbolic language to prevent distortion of meaning. Science uses math as a language of precise and unambiguous communication, but never as a tool of investigation. 2.4.2\tThe standard of certainty Science demands certainty of causality. The law of causation simply means that nothing is random. Necessity means that it is certain that the effect can never occur without the cause. Sufficiency also means that it is certain that the cause can never fail to give rise to the effect. Ontology demands that no explanation can be offered if there is no fact to explain. The fact cannot be imagined or hypothesized: it must be observed objectively, and described with respect to its essential character. In short, rhetoric cannot leave any room for hypothesis testing at all. Science must describe first, explain later, and guess never. In short, the standard of rhetoric is to offer an explanation that is (1) indisputable in fact, and (2) irrefutable in logic of causation. To make people wise, the scientist presents the plain facts plainly, without the distortion by statistical inference. This point needs careful clarification. Economic science explains the plain universal fact that people buy products rather than produce them because they want to reduce the cost of procurement through purchase compared to cost of production. The explanation is universal: no matter what kind of product it is, and no matter what quantity it is, anything that is bought is not produced by the buyer for exactly the same general reason: gains from trade. Similarly, no matter what kind of object it is, no matter how big or small it is, everything falls towards the nearest object with a larger mass. The rhetorical purpose of communicating knowledge is different from the policy purpose of estimation. If the policymaker wants to provide cookies to schoolchildren, he of course needs to gain a quantitative sense of how many cookies for how many children he will need to budget. A rule of thumb will be generally adequate. In short, a statistical presentation of quantitative data is not required to communicate the general knowledge of economic science. But one must gather the data to carry out estimates if the goal is the application of the general knowledge to the specific case. Thus, theoretical physics has no good reason to describe the particular electrical fan such as whether its blades are 12 inches or 19 inches long. The theory applies generally to all fans of all sizes. But the technology to make fans must work out the details of the fan\u2019s description. In short, economists would gather empirical data in designing policy parameters, but not in explaining general theories. In general, descriptive data free from the distortion of statistical inference provide the rule of thumb for policy design in the context of the law of large numbers. Nobody needs an absolutely precise prediction, but a ball park figure with a degree of tolerance (margin of inaccuracy). The main part of rhetoric is to explain the meaning in an irrefutable manner. This is much harder. Without long training in logic, people are vulnerable to misinterpretation. It remains the lifelong struggle of the philosopher to train people how to think correctly and thereby interpret correctly. No amount of skill in math can help in this regard. 2.5\tA scorecard of three paradigms Here is a short scorecard of how the three paradigms fare in terms of the four standards of science. Standard/ Paradigm\tOntology\tEpistemology\tMethodology\tRhetoric Classical\tSuccessful\tFails\tSuccessful\tSuccessful Neoclassical\tFails\tFails\tFails\tFails Consistent\tSuccessful\tSuccessful\tSuccessful\tSuccessful The main point of this scorecard is that neoclassical economics fails on all accounts. The other point is that consistent economics is an improved version of classical economics by virtue of its epistemological discovery of the institutional law of exchange. The job is to see whether this is an improvement or not. 3\tThe consistent paradigm Although the consistent paradigm is the newest and not yet known well, it is presented first as a benchmark. This will help reduce repetition when comparing paradigms. The exercise is brief. A fuller exposition is available in a text with more 140,000 words. This exercise shows an example of how to meet the standards of science to build a science of the economy. An irritable problem of searching for unity beneath the diversity is the apparent repetition of the unifying theme. Repetition is the rope from which the spine of the unifying theme has to hang. Indiscipline occurs because one forgets to revert to the straightening rope. Straying is the road to indiscipline as one keeps forgetting the straight path. 3.1\tConsistent ontology: The reality of exchange Different objects are traded between different agents. One can study the behavior of the traded objects. Or one could study the behavior of the agents. What will satisfy the ontology better is the issue at stake. A study of the behavior of traded objects may discover the operation of a teleological law of exchange governing the determination of the kinds and quantities of the traded objects, and the associated incomes and expenditures of the agents. The analysis of exchange may be called consistency analysis because the behavior of the objects is consistent with the operation of social laws of exchange. The study of the behavior of observable objects of exchange meets the ontological dictum. The study of the behavior of the economic agents violates the ontological dictum, because the state of mind of the agent is unobservable and yet it must be the source of explanation of agent behavior. There is an even more damaging problem: the same traded object is bought and sold by different people who must have precisely opposite states of mind with regard to the same object. Even if one could observe the state of mind, one could still not use it to explain the behavior. This point will become clearer later in respect of epistemology. 3.2\tThe character of exchange The elements necessary and sufficient to define the character of exchange are the dimensions of exchange. First, an exchange requires at least two different objects that serve as mutual payments. For example, John gives x to Ken, who gives y to John. The first element is that there is a relation between the two objects (x, y). This relation determines the quantities of x and y. There must be some kind of law to determine the relation between the objects. It means that if there is a single object, it cannot be an object of exchange. One cannot find real examples where a farmer sells a bag of rice and gets paid back in an identical bag of rice. There is no exchange if an agent gets back just what he gives. Why this is so must be explained. Why would one buy x and pay y if his cost of production of y is the same as his cost of purchase of x? Why would one buy x and pay y if his benefit of consumption of x is the same as his benefit of consumption of y? Secondly, exchange requires at least two different agents. A single isolated agent cannot embark on exchange with himself. The agent to agent relation is a social relation of reciprocal payment. There must be some kind of law governing the agent to agent relation. Lastly, there is a necessary relation between the agent and the objects. The agent incurs a cost to produce or purchase the object. The agent derives a benefit from consuming or selling the object. There must be some kind of law governing this relation too. This law would have to explain why John would sell x rather than consume it, and why Ken would buy x rather than produce it. By defining all three possible relations in an exchange, one defines the character of exchange fully. It will later appear that the classical and the neoclassical paradigms just could not completely describe the character of exchange, and hence could not hope to understand it completely. 3.3\tConsistent epistemology: the law of exchange The gaining of knowledge is accomplished by finding the laws that govern the phenomenon of exchange and determine its character. There is a law of exchange with three rules governing the three dimensions of exchange. A little background to this discovery is helpful. Human beings are the only animals known to engage in exchange with strangers. It is a very recent novel phenomenon. If one accepts that homo sapiens existed for at least 200,000 years, and that exchange began no later than 20,000 years ago, it is still the case that 90% of the tenure of the human species went without any occurrence of exchange. One must remember that 20,000 years ago the planet could not possibly have a human population any larger than just about 25,000 individuals, dispersed across the globe in small bands of about 25 people in each clan-family. The occurrence of exchange would be a wholly unnatural event in that era. Anthropologists would have to see that exchange of gifts between clans do not qualify as exchange. One way transfers of charity or plunder do not qualify as exchange. The human species evolved in the natural ecological state, and people had to obey the natural law of subsistence just like every other animal. First, to stay alive, each individual animal had to procure and consume the means of livelihood, which was originally limited to food. But the first part of the law of subsistence is the law of consumption (that limits how much is consumed). It says that one cannot consume what has not been produced. Naturally occurring plants and prey animals constitute the resource that must be procured before these can be consumed. The act of procuring the resources by the exercise of labor is called production. Thus the fish in the river is the resource. Before one can eat the fish, it must be captured. The capturing is production. The captured fish is a product. The productive act of occupation of a resource such as land turns it into a tradable property. Before something can be traded, it must be owned by way of production or occupancy. Next, the second part of the law of subsistence is a version of the natural law of conservation of energy. No animal can survive if it wastes energy in the production of what it does not consume. This part is the natural law of production (limiting how much is produced). Production cannot exceed consumption. A mathematician may jump in ecstatic joy that this part can be given an exciting and elegant dress in mathematical language. One can say that the animal minimizes the cost of production for any given output. It automatically implies that the animal maximizes benefit per unit of cost. Taken together, the natural law of subsistence (natural law of production + natural law of consumption) means that an animal consumes what it produces and produces what it consumes, making production equal to consumption. Nature does not allow an animal to consume what it does not produce and to produce what it does not consume. But the modern humans do violate the law of subsistence, quite deliberately. They produce what they do not consume (but sell), and they consume what they do not produce (but buy). This is possible by virtue of a very special mental faculty of the human. Israel Kirzner (1979) has used the term \u2018alertness to opportunity\u2019 to refer to this. This is very different from rationality. At this point, a critical distinction must be made to separate family from strangers. A mother eagle mercilessly kills the chicks of pigeons and other species of birds because the pigeons are strangers liable to be killed and eaten. But her own chicks are her family. The mother eagle does not kill her own chicks and eat them, but she nurtures them and feeds them. Her behavior towards family is different from that towards strangers. The humans are natural hunters. It is hard to swallow the harsh truth. Humans are cannibals, at least with respect to the wealth of strangers. Alexander has no qualms about subduing weaker kings like Purus and Darius to take their kingdoms by force of superior brutality and cunning. The humans passed through the ecology and are not yet fully emancipated from it. Stealing, robbery, and fraud continue to occur despite thousands of years of ceaseless moralizing and the existence of institutional punishments. By virtue of alertness, some humans discovered the opportunity to unite many weak families in an army of resistance against marauding plunderers. After more than ten thousand years of relentless resistance against plunder, through endless trials and errors, the humans have been able to create manmade social institutions. These are rules of conduct designed to repudiate the savage impulses of nature and to facilitate mutually gainful pursuits between natural strangers and enemies. A society is created when natural enemies agree to a set of rules of conduct to co-exist peacefully. There is no society between the tigers and the deer: only an ecological battlefield. In a society, plunder is forbidden and payment is mandated. Hence the first part of the discovery of the law of exchange is the there is an institutional law of exchange that categorically repudiates the natural law of subsistence. It allows a man to consume what he does not produce, but it does not allow one to produce by way of murder and plunder. People are allowed to carry on production by murder (euphemistically called hunting) on non-human animals, but are not allowed to kill, rape, plunder, and enslave other humans. But despite organized social resistance with enforcement instruments of the courts, the police, and the prisons, the natural cannibalistic impulse still finds expression in endless instances of theft, robbery, fraud and corruption. Resisting nature is not easy. It is now possible to look in more detail into the various parts of the law of exchange. \u2022\tFirst, the object to object relation is governed by the rule of equivalence to determine the quantities (and exchange rates) of the traded objects. It determines the dimension of value. \u2022\tSecondly, the agent to agent relation is governed by the rule of reciprocity to determine the kinds of the objects of exchange. This determines the dimension of payment. The seller earns a claim on the buyer for a payment. The buyer incurs an obligation to deliver a payment to the seller. The reciprocity rule says that the buyer must pay the seller and pay nobody else. The seller must get the payment from the buyer and from nobody else. How this rule allows the appearance of money and bond as traded objects is the big story of reciprocity. How reciprocity creates society among natural enemies is the biggest story in all social science. \u2022\tLastly, the agent to object relation is governed by the social rule of freedom of enterprise (=freedom to buy and sell). It determines the welfare dimension of exchange. Welfare is benefit minus cost. The rule gives a man the freedom to buy rather than produce something. It gives the agent the freedom to sell rather than suffer the compulsion to consume what he has produced. It also allows the strange phenomenon of intermediation, the most unnatural event, so that one may buy what one does not consume, and sell what one does not produce. People exercise these freedoms to improve welfare. A buyer defeats optimal least-cost production to resort to purchase, because the cost of purchase is lower than the cost of production. The seller defeats the utility-maximizing consumption in order to reach super-optimal gains. He sells the object when the benefit of sale is larger than the benefit of consumption. The intermediary achieves welfare from arbitrage and seigniorage. He buys cheap and sells dear. He issues money and bonds to earn a seigniorage fee from goods that he neither produces nor consumes, and indeed neither buys nor sells. Consistency analysis is an analysis of exchange consistent with the three rules of exchange. It meets the epistemological criteria of finding the necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of exchange. The three rules fully (sufficiently) determine the character of exchange. And all three rules are necessary to determine the character of exchange. 3.4\tConsistent methodology: the analysis of exchange The analytical method demonstrates how the law of exchange determines the kinds and quantities of the objects of trade. It determines the associated incomes and expenditure of the agents, and their welfare gains. The philosophical meaning of methodology is that it is a method to prove the epistemological discovery of the operation of the law of exchange to the facts of observation. Nothing can be called a law if it can be violated. The proof must show that the law is necessary to determine the occurrence of the fact, and is also sufficient. The outcome of the operation of the law must be certain, and hence indisputable on grounds of facts. The logic of causation must be beyond refutation. That is, the meaning must be unambiguous and beyond doubt. It is worth reminding that natural cannibals of course try to rob, steal, cheat and so on, and robbery, theft, and fraud are not instances of failure of the law of exchange. It is a sign of imperfection of society in respect of enforcement of its rules of conduct. 1.\tExchange defeats optimization to reach super-optimal outcomes. Instead of producing something at minimum cost, an enterprising agent purchases the same thing at a purchase price lower than the minimum cost of production he would incur to produce it. Instead of consuming something he has produced and get the maximum benefit of consumption, an enterprising agent sells the good at a price much higher than marginal benefit of consumption. 2.\tThe act of enterprise (buying, selling) is possible if there is a real opportunity for gainful trade. The gains from trade are of two kinds. The purchaser\u2019s gain is cost reduction below the minimum cost of production. The seller\u2019s gain is benefit enlargement above the maximum benefit of consumption. This point needs to be repeated endlessly to rescue people from the poison of optimal choice. 3.\tCost reduction is possible if there is precisely opposite performance order of the concerned agents over a given pair of traded objects. Performance order is expressed as a ratio of marginal costs of the specified objects of trade. Thus (cxj < cyj) means that John (j) incurs a lower cost to produce x than y. At the same time, for Ken (cxk > cyk) means that Ken incurs a higher cost to produce x than y. Then there is a performance order over (x, y) shown as (cxj /cyj) <( cxk / cyk). This is the Ricardian concept of comparative cost advantage made to stand on its head. It says that John can gain a cost reduction \uf070y=(cyj \u2013 cxj) by aborting the production of y in favor of purchasing it at a price of x. Similarly, Ken may achieve a cost reduction if he aborts the production of x and instead buys it against less costly y. 4.\tBenefit enlargement is possible from sale. Thus (bxj <byj) means that John (j) gets a lower benefit from consuming x than y. However, for Ken (bxk > byk) means that Ken gets a higher benefit to consume x than y. Then there is a preference order over (x, y) shown as (bxj /byj) <( bxk / byk)). This may be called the Mengerian dictum. In standard neoclassical notation John\u2019s preference order is [Uj(x) <Uj(y)] while Ken\u2019s preference order is its exact opposite [Uk(x) > Uk(y)]. If this preference order exists, John can enlarge his benefit by aborting the consumption of x that he produces in favor of selling it for y that gives him higher benefit. 5.\tThe logic is that performance order (comparative cost) tells who can gain by not producing, while the preference order (comparative benefit) says who can gain by not consuming. One can defeat optimization by aborting production in favor of purchase and by aborting consumption in favor of sale. One cannot reduce the cost of production below the minimum cost of production if he keeps producing it: he must abort production and buy it from someone who incurs a lower cost of production and charges a price lower than the buyer\u2019s marginal cost of production. Similarly, one must abort the consumption to enlarge the benefit above the maximum benefit of consumption, by selling the product for something of larger benefit. 6.\tBenefit is a better term than utility. Marginal benefit is marginal utility converted into units of money to make it comparable to marginal cost, also counted in units of money (or whatever the numeraire is). Thus bx=(ux/\uf06c\uf029\uf020where \uf06c is the Lagrangean multiplier interpreted as the marginal utility of money and ux is the marginal utility of x. 7.\tTrade is impossible unless the performance orders and the preference orders are precisely intransitive between the agents. Thus if both John and Ken incur lower cost to produce x than y, none will buy x in exchange for y, and none will sell y in exchange for x. Again, if both John and Ken prefer x to y, none will sell x against y, and none will buy y against x. To be tradable, the object must be one that one agent wants to sell while the other agent wants to buy it, against the same other payment. 8.\tAs the transitive order of preference does not hold between the agents, there is no way to make a meaningful measure of the cost or the benefit, and no way to ascertain if something is the maximum or the minimum. Thus x is both more costly and less costly than y at the same time, implying that there is no meaningful social measure of cost. In short, optimization is defeated by enterprise (buying and selling). 9.\tIt is analytically convenient to define agents according to the different goods they sell, so that n agents sell n different goods. An nxn matrix of exchange then looks exactly like Leontief\u2019s input-output table. The matrix Q stands for the market economy. Consistency analysis analyzes why the kinds and quantities of the goods in the economy Q are what they are rather than otherwise, according to the three social rules. Q= \t\tq11 q12 q13 ... q1n q21 q22 q23 ... q2n q31 q32 q33 ... q3n.. .. ... .... ... .... qn1 qn2 qn3 ... qnn 10.\tThe output matrix has a corresponding value matrix V that can be neatly decomposed into four parts to separate the output according to the means of payment. In step 1, the diagonal terms are kept and the off-diagonal terms are set to zero to get the subsistence matrix of non-traded output. In the second step, the off-diagonal terms are divided between directly traded barter goods and indirectly traded goods. The trick is to take the minimum of the pair as bjk= min (vjk, vkj) and replace both values by this barter possibility bjk. The third step is to get the indirect trade matrix W with the terms wjk=(vjk \u2013bjk). This part must be settled by money. Lastly, the imbalance between income and expenditure of any given agent j is taken as fj=(\uf053kvjk - \uf053kvkj). If this is a (positive) surplus, j lends this to buy bonds. If this is negative, j borrows this by selling bonds fj (future value). The decomposition reveals that the different means of payment affect the output differently. The matrix of indirectly traded output shows a specific equilibrium quantity of money. The intertemporally traded output requires bonds as means of payment. A new theory of payment becomes the heart of economic analysis. Payment policy on money and credit to manage claims and obligations becomes the heart and soul of economic policy. 11.\tOn the same set of traded goods, many different people perform many different acts of livelihood (production and consumption), enterprise (buying and selling), and finance (giving and receiving payments). They have conflicting performance orders over comparative costs of production, and opposite preference orders over comparative benefits of consumption.

The clue is that there are four mutually exclusive regimes of exchange where the same equation produces different outcomes according to the different contexts of exchange. These regimes neatly correspond to four layers of market equilibrium of exchange. 13.\tIf qjk is something John (j) sells to Ken (k), while Ken gives John something in payment called qkj, then the basic exchange equation is just [pjk*qjk=pkj*qjk]. More compactly, it is [vjk=vkj] where [vjk= pjk*qjk], and [vkj= pkj*qkj]. The problem is that mathematics regards this as a definitional identity, while economics must find how it reflects reality as an equation, namely why vjk may fail to be equal to vkj. So it is worthwhile to show the mathematics of identity and the economics of equation side by side. The same equation is explored in four layers: Layer\tRegime\tIdentity (Mathematics)\tEquation (Economics)\tCondition for equation (Social science) 1\tNo trade\tvjk \u2261 vkj\tvjk = vkj\tj=k 2\tDirect Trade\tvjk \u2261 vkj\tvjk = vkj\tj \u2260 k 3\tIndirect Trade\t\uf053kvjk\u2261 \uf053kvkj\t\uf053kvjk= \uf053kvkj\tvjk\u2260 vkj if mkj=(vjk- vkj)\u22600 4\tIntertemporal Trade\t\uf053j\uf053kvjk\u2261 \uf053j\uf053kvkj\t\uf053j\uf053kvjk= \uf053j\uf053kvkj\t\uf053kvjk\u2260\uf053kvkj if fj=(\uf053kvjk - \uf053kvkj)\u22600 14.\tThe equation of exchange genuinely begins at layer 2. Here, the magic is that John (j) is not identical with Ken (k). John and Ken are mutual strangers. Also the good x\u2261qjk (say food) is not identical with the good y\u2261qkj (say cloth). To see why this is magical, consistency analysis degrades this equation to descend to layer 1 of the ecology. Here, John cannot be different from Ken as agents of production and consumption, and x cannot be different in kind from y as objects of production and consumption. 15.\tThe first layer is the natural ecology of livelihood. Nature does not allow the producer to be different from the consumer. Indeed, most animals have just one organ of the body- the mouth- to carry out production and consumption. When the cow applies its mouth to cut the blades of grass off the ground, it produces the grass. But then without delay, it swallows the grass, which means it consumes it. It is difficult to imagine how a cow will produce the grass and a stranger such as a deer will consume it (without plunder). 16.\tGregarious animals live in family herds. The individual members do not exist independently of the others. They collectively co-own everything they produce and share the output they consume. There is biological identity inside the family: there is no exchange between the mother and the children or between siblings or mates. Though it is a natural collective, it behaves like a single agent (household). Thus if John and Ken are two members of a forager family, they must be regarded as identical. Something produced by John is automatically regarded as Ken\u2019s output too as they co-own all that they produce. 17.\tThe natural household cannot consume what it does not produce, and it cannot produce what it does not consume. The natural law of conservation of energy says that it cannot waste energy on production of what it will not consume. So in this layer, producer John is identical with consumer Ken and hence the equation is an exaggerated identity vjj\u2261 vjj or vkk\u2261vkk. For each single object, the equation then means that production (left side) is equal to consumption (right side). If there are two goods both of which are produced and consumed by the same agent, the goods have a quantitative relation of substitution. The marginal rate of substitution in production is equal to the marginal rate of substitution in consumption. This essentially means that the goods are identical in kind. 18.\tThe difference in kind is a highly abstract concept. Let an agent derive the same utility from consuming 2 apples or 3 bananas. Then an apple is another name of 3/2 bananas. A banana is just 2/3 apples. To be different, they must differ in cost and benefit despite being identical in quantity (synthetic value). Again, a physically identical good may become different goods to different people if they incur different production costs or derive different consumption benefits. The same good may become different to the same agent at different times and places if the difference in time or place makes the cost or the benefit different. To be different in kind, objects of the same value must be of different costs or benefits or both. 19.\tThe concept of a representative agent is a concept of identity: all agents are identical. This is the critical problem. If every agent minimizes cost of production, how can then some of them abort production in favor of purchase from others? The crucial part is that different people incur different costs, even as each incurs minimum cost within his personal constraints. 20.\tTo see how people are not identical so that a buyer can never represent a seller, three important differences need recognition. The first concerns the difference between family and strangers. The second makes the ecology different from the economy. The third makes natural law different from social law. All three differences together make it possible to see that rationality is different from alertness. 21.\tThe point of this difference is extremely serious. Human beings are natural cannibals with respect to other human strangers. People outside the family are their natural targets of hunting. Biological cannibalism among humans is extremely rare, but economic cannibalism is near universal. Without social resistance and rules of conduct, the humans are naturally inclined to cannibalize the wealth of other humans not belonging to their families. Ten thousand plus years of ceaseless warfare, the long and unbroken history of murder and plunder, rape and slavery, invasions and piracy, theft, robbery, fraud, corruption et cetera indicate that in the state of nature, humans have no hesitation to suppress the weak, and enslave, rape, and plunder them. Anybody who doubts this may leave their purses on the sidewalk unguarded and watch what happens. Such thinkers will have no explanation of why robbery, theft, and fraud and corruption are still rampant after thousands of years of ceaseless sermons on moral conduct, and despite laws punishing violations. 22.\tEven if not all individuals are cannibals, there are plenty of them around to make it a critical point. Against the rampaging cannibals, humans had to wage relentless war of resistance. They had to establish institutions to prohibit plunder and mandate payment. One cannot hope to live in peace by abolishing the police, the army, the courts, and the legal institutions of resistance against plunder. 23.\tThe appearance of the institution in human society is a vexing problem. The institution is a set of rules to defy and defeat natural law. Society repudiates the natural liberty of the strong to plunder the weak. It imposes the mandate to pay that nature never imposed. The economy stands on the freedom of enterprise that defies nature to produce what one does not consume and to consume what one does not produce. No social science is possible without acknowledging the existence of social laws that are distinct from natural laws. The natural impulses of rape and plunder seem to constantly challenge the operation of social laws. It is not easy to defy nature. Compliance with social law needs training and vigilance. 24.\tEconomics brings forward the insight that human beings have a mental faculty far superior to that of rationality. By virtue of alertness to opportunity, a super rational (alert) man aborts the production of what he consumes in favor of purchase. This occurs because his cost of procurement through purchase is lower than his cost of procurement through production. To make this possible, economics needs an equation borne out of inequality. The cost of production of a traded good incurred by the consumer is higher than the cost of production incurred by the producer. That is why the consumer aborts production in favor of purchase. 25.\tThe mathematician figures out that the producer minimizes the cost of production such that the price he charges is equal to marginal cost. In turn, the consumer maximizes benefit of consumption so that the marginal benefit of consumption is equal to the price he pays. If the buyer is identical with the seller, there is no trade, and the mathematician is right. The rational optimizer has no opportunity to sell to a stranger at a price higher than marginal cost, because there is nobody else. He cannot buy the product at a price lower than his marginal cost of production, again because there is nobody else. 26.\tEconomics of course finds the way out. The producer is different from the consumer. To produce the same good, the seller incurs a lower cost of production than the buyer. The difference is usually large enough to allow the producer to sell at a price higher than marginal cost of production. In addition, an intermediary may add a mark-up arbitrage profit so that the consumer pays a price higher than what the producer receives. Yet the consumer makes a pure gain, as the price of purchase is lower than the marginal cost of production incurred by the consumer. Of course the consumer aborts production because it is too costly compared to purchase. 27.\tThe fact that every optimizer minimizes cost of production and maximizes benefit of consumption is completely empty of meaning. It is a mere definition of optimality, and has no reflection of reality at all. 28.\tTo move from layer 2 to layer 3, here is the story of identity and equation. For a given agent j, one can sum up the basic equation [vjk= vkj] to get [\uf053kvjk\u2261 \uf053kvkj] for a particular agent j. The left side is the sum of all sales by j to all buyers k=1,2,..n. The right side is the sum of all purchases by j from all sellers k=1,2,...n. This will hold identically if in each transaction, j\u2019s real good pays for the real good he gets from any k. But the economics is that he may defeat direct trade and violate equation 2. Some of his customers take real goods and give no real goods, but give him money. Some of his suppliers give him real goods against money rather than against real goods. He can do it as long as the money he earns is equal to the money he spends. 29.\tTo use money, the agent must serve as a proxy intermediary. He will take money from his customer who is not his supplier, and give money to his supplier who is not his customer. In short, indirect trade occurs when the customer is different from the supplier with respect to the same agent. Direct trade requires John\u2019s customer (of x) to be identical with John\u2019s supplier (of y). 30.\tLastly, the move from layer 3 to layer 4 is a perilous journey for the mathematician. The identity that the aggregate value of all supplies (\uf053j\uf053kvjk) is equal to the aggregate value of all demands (\uf053j\uf053kvkj) has no useful economic meaning. The classical identity (Say\u2019s Law) came under attack from Keynes who sought to turn it into an equation, by specifying conditions under which aggregate demand may differ from aggregate supply. But without proper trade theoretic details, there is a severe confusion between money and bond. Consistency analysis shows that money occurs at layer 3 under indirect trade to allow transfer of value. However, bond occurs in layer 4 to allow store of value under intertemporal trade. 31.\tThe occurrence of unemployment at layer 3 owing to shortage of money adds a new theory of money that could not have been framed without invoking social laws. These are laws about claims and obligations. By invoking social laws, consistency analysis is able to explain enterprise (buying and selling) and unemployment (failed enterprise), and intermediation, transaction cost, and entrepreneurial profit-making. Without social laws, one cannot explain any of the above. 32.\tConsistency analysis reaches conclusions that could not be reached by optimization analysis. Exchange occurs between strangers who incur different costs of production and derive different benefits of consumption. It is then possible that the producer sells at a price higher than marginal cost. The merchant then adds a mark-up. The price the consumer pays is higher than price the producer receives. Yet, the consumer pays a price lower than the marginal cost of production he would have incurred if he had to produce it. Consistent theory of price rejects neoclassical price theory. It categorically dismisses the idea that the market price is equal to the marginal cost of production and the marginal benefit of consumption. 33.\tConsistency analysis can easily detect the presence of transfer of value between strangers to allow indirect trade by using money as the only possible means of payment. For example, a naked farmer needs cloth to cover his shame, but his cost of cloth production is practically infinitely high as he has no skill and no equipment and resource to produce cloth at all. He is good at producing food. He produces far more food than what he himself eats. He deliberately produces what he does not wish to consume. No amount of rationality can explain why one who needs cloth will produce the food that he will not eat. Consistency analysis sees him as an entrepreneur seeking pure gains from enterprise. Next, the farmer meets a weaver who has the cloth he wants. But the weaver is sick and needs medicine and does not need food, so she refuses to sell the cloth against the food she will not eat. Next, the pharmacist is starving and must get the food to stay alive. But the farmer refuses to sell the food against a payment in medicine, because he needs no medicine to cure his naked but healthy body. 34.\tBut alertness strikes and the farmer detects an opportunity to carry out a two step procedure of indirect trade. He buys the medicine he has no intention to consume. Hence it is an unnatural artificial demand for medicine. Then he sells the medicine to the weaver to pay for the cloth. This time, his supply of medicine is artificial and unnatural. He has used medicine as money, as an instrument to transfer his claim from his customer of food to his non-customer, from claiming medicine to claiming cloth. He also uses money to discharge his obligation. Instead of giving the food to his supplier of cloth, he gives money (medicine-money). 35.\tIt is easy to see the dynamics. To reduce transaction cost of using money, people gradually abandoned more costly commodity money to use less costly fiat money to ultimately settle on non-physical electronic money. 36.\tIt is easy to see that for exchange to occur, the object has to go from the producer to the consumer. The post-production cost of sending the good from the producer to the consumer is transaction cost. An intermediary appears in society to reduce this cost far below what the original producer or the ultimate consumer would incur in direct trade. Direct trade is generally ruled out by prohibitively high transaction cost. Indirect trade dominates trade by virtue of the special professional ability of the intermediary to reduce the transaction cost. Intermediaries not only exist unlike the invisible hand; they are really the creators of society in the first place. They create the market by unnatural acts of manipulation to persuade perfect strangers and natural enemies to produce for each other, often without ever meeting each other. The social laws are their devices of manipulation. 37.\tBy virtue of alertness, intermediaries take full advantage of intransitive preference orders to organize mutually gainful trades, and issue and manage money as the most commonly traded object without being a real object. Consistency analysis is able to develop monetary theory that has no resemblance to older theory. It sees money as a device to transfer claims and obligations on real goods between perfect strangers, owing to the presence of the intermediary who manages the transfer of claims and obligations. It is able to develop a theory of intermediation and of institutions that earlier economics simply could not touch. It can define and measure the exact equilibrium quantity of money, and describe its exact path of circulation. It can offer guidance to policy to solve real economic problems. 38.\tA full exposition of consistency analysis shows how the law of exchange determines every possible economic event. It must come as a big shock that a single equation of exchange explains all of economics. 3.5\tConsistent rhetoric of exchange To persuade readers of its validity, consistency analysis begins and ends with facts, and does not employ any factual assumption at all. It insists on being nakedly realistic. To assure the reader, it insists on certainty of the predicted outcome, and does not allow any mention of probability. By virtue of unification, all of economics is compactly put in a single easy frame, making learning it incredibly easy. The biggest rhetorical advantage of consistency analysis is that it is unified and more complete than previous economics. It is the simplest to understand with the least room for doubt or debate. There is just one equation of reciprocal equivalence to explain everything in economics. Consistency analysis offers a more complete description of the market, and provides a much simpler explanation than the other paradigms that could not handle intermediation and reciprocity. Consistency analysis aims to achieve indisputability in the facts and irrefutability in the logic of causation. Its characterization of exchange does not seem open to dispute. Corresponding to each traded good, there is another good as its payment. Each traded good has two agents as buyer and seller related by payment claims and obligations. And each agent has a cost and benefit relation with each of the pair of traded goods. It also seems that the law of exchange is irrefutable as a causal law. There is no doubt that a lot of debate will occur over the issue of whether the rules of equivalence, reciprocity, and freedom of enterprise are necessary and sufficient to determine the character of exchange. Lest it be misunderstood, the terms alertness and the entrepreneurial pursuit of gain are not facts independent of thought: these are meanings. One cannot go out and see and measure the alertness. The act of purchase means that the agent was alert to the opportunity to reduce the cost of procurement below that of production. This meaning cannot be asserted as a fact because one cannot measure the cost of the production that has not taken place. Rationality of an optimizer and super-rationality of an entrepreneur are meanings attached to observed acts and are not facts. Hence if the critic wants to raise objection, the challenge is to find a better term that reflects the meaning more intelligibly and lucidly, with less ambiguity and so on. Consistent economics is the polar opposite of a dismal science. Alertness to opportunity and the ceaseless inventiveness of the human make it possible for people to embark on an orgy of production, with increasing share of all kinds of frivolities. There is hope that proper use of money as a device to manage claims and obligations between perfect strangers can put an end to poverty. People have already defied natural law of life expectancy to live three times longer than natural life expectancy. With creative engineering of the market process, they may also reduce conflicts to a great extent. Humanity may enjoy ever more economic solvency, political security, and cultural tolerance towards an increasingly more civilized society. When conduct is consistent with rules of conduct, and theory is consistent with facts of experience, one finds a sweeter intellectual life. The last paragraph above is an example of how to boast and self-congratulate. It shows that nobody is infallible. In a short life, should not people have some chance to laugh and cry? After forty-plus years of bearing the anguish of the sense of betrayal by neoclassical economics, is this too much of a lapse from the presumed dispassion of the scientist? And will it be too much to shed a few tears for Smith, Malthus, Ricardo, Marx, Wicksell, Keynes, Leontief, Mises, and Kirzner? These people cared deeply about the sordid state in which they found humanity, and applied whatever law of science they were trained to, so that they could figure out solutions. Nature betrayed them by failing to run the economy by natural law. They missed the prize by a very small margin. 3.6\tOld ideas in new settings Consistent economics explicitly keeps certain old ideas. It pays tributes to Bertrand Russell (1918) for giving hope that progress of science is possible if people happen to notice the obvious that earlier generations managed to ignore. The the buyer pays the seller is an old fact. But the idea that the buyer pays the seller is incredibly new! Previous economics never recognized that the seller earns a claim on the buyer for a payment and the buyer incurs an obligation to the seller to make a payment. Previous economics never defined a payment as anything that settles the claim of the seller and the obligation of the buyer. Consistent economics salutes Richard Whately (1832) for articulating the idea of economics as a science of exchange. He coined the term catallactics for it. But the term did not catch on, and nobody provided a formal tool to analyze exchange. A century after Whately, Robbins (1932) christened economics as a study of allocation of scarce resources that had alternative uses. Neoclassical economics never embarked on a study of entrepreneurial profit through exchange. It buried the possibility of exchange by asserting efficiency of allocation in equilibrium at zero profit. William Baumol (1968) lamented that entrepreneurship disappeared from economic theory. A quest that lasted for more than forty years to make sense of economic realities could not arise in the vacuum. Precious old ideas guided the reconstruction. Here is a short list of the key old ideas. 3.6.1\tClassical ideas 3.6.1.1\tEquilibrium price The classical concept of equilibrium price as being the price at which demand is equal to supply provided an anchor. Without this, the idea of equivalence would have fallen apart. 3.6.1.2\tWalker\u2019s idea of value Amasa Walker\u2019s clear statement that (exchange) value must be judged as the quantity of one good that would pay for another helped the emancipation from the derailment of the mental magnitude called use value (Walker 1865). Consistent economics is not entirely free from the phantom of utility, but is able to disregard it as being without a meaningful measure. The term benefit at some level refers to the strength of preference, but it is still possible to discard the mention of utility function. 3.6.1.3\tWalker\u2019s four-way trade Walker\u2019s (1865) example of four-way trade offered a clear depiction of circulation of money. To honor Walker, the payment circuit is named Walker Circuit. 3.6.1.4\tWicksell\u2019s example of three-way trade The author wants to honor Knut Wicksell by naming the matrix of values of indirectly traded goods as the \u2018Wicksell Matrix\u2019. Wicksell however did not use the example to launch a model of indirect trade with money as its necessary means of payment. 3.6.1.5\tLeontief\u2019s input-output model Consistency analysis would probably not be born at all without the womb of input-output analysis. Wassily Leontief\u2019s rigorous formulation was a matter of strong confidence on the viability of a model of exchange. It is fair to say that consistent economics took input-output table as a bottle and poured the spirit in it, with much of it distilled from Austrian economics. This author salutes the great giant Leontief who personally inspired the work. A word of advice rings in the ear. With his thick Russian accent, Leontief sternly warned that no model should be made that could not have the data in principle to populate it. A staunch and uncompromising commitment to realism is a quality that all honest economic scientists must cultivate. This was a much needed discipline. Leontief\u2019s model was the perfect tool to examine the symmetry (reciprocity). Had this tool not existed, it is possible that one could not even begin to make sense of reciprocity. Consistent economics could not begin without Leontief\u2019s supreme gift, although he did not explore the symmetry as such. 3.6.2\tAustrian Ideas Several ideas of the Austrian School provided the strength to keep on with the task of analyzing exchange. After all, the neoclassical school abandoned exchange and focused on allocation using marginal equalities. This was a deranged aggression of calculus without much teeth and bite. 3.6.2.1\tMenger on laws without exception After spending years in school hearing about randomness and probability, it is next to impossible to gather the courage to look for laws that do not admit of any exception. The guru of the Austrian School came as the savior. Menger insisted that science needs to identify laws that allow no exception. 3.6.2.2\tMenger dictum Even though Menger was not sufficiently forceful that exchange must be gainful (by acknowledging limiting cases of zero profit), his ideas provided the courage and hope to keep looking for persistence of profit in exchange equilibrium. 3.6.2.3\tMisesian entrepreneurship Ludwig von Mises exerted strong influence with his emphatic statement that man is entrepreneurial, always seeking improvements over the current state of living. This inspiration was the lifeline in a frustrating quest that took more than forty years. Had the faith in the essential entrepreneurial pursuit of man diminished, the idea of consistent economics would be aborted. 3.6.2.4\tMises on indirect trade Mises (1949) penned more than 37000 words on a chapter on indirect trade. He did not feel the need to provide a formal model of indirect trade. His own understanding must have been so clear to him that he did not feel the need to spell it out. His penetrating insight was that money was necessary to allow indirect trade, although he did not spend many words to explain how. Later on, his disciple Rothbard (1962) also wrote on indirect trade, but again without much elaboration. Luckily, Amasa Walker\u2019s example provided a clean way to formalize a model. 3.6.2.5\tMises on non-neutrality of money The non-neutrality of money as a means of payment was crystal clear to Mises, though he did not take time to explain it in formal details to make it plain to the clueless. The long and arduous battle to get out of the thick blanket of neutral money could not be won without the constant faith in Mises. 3.6.2.6\tSchumpeter on innovation Schumpeter\u2019s enduring gift to economics is his monumental History of Economic Analysis (Schumpeter 1954) that would keep alive the faith that there would be some modicum of science in economics. His biography would have given much courage to anyone who sought to escape the imprisoning ideas in which he was raised. Despite enduring decades of exposure to the rapacious hypothesis mongering and deluge of absurdities by the likes of Kenneth Arrow, Robert Solow, Robert Lucas Jr., Robert Barro, and others, one could still keep hope alive that not all is lost. Schumpeter\u2019s entrepreneur is a creative destroyer. This idea could give impetus to one who would like to seek destruction of what ought to be obsolete, and to create what ought to be erected on a strong foundation. One of the things that a commercial intermediary destroys is the natural conflict between strangers engaged in a battle of mutual plunder. He does this by creatively designing a deal that enables the combatants to get what they want without the fight, by giving up a small payment for a large benefit. This way of interpreting the idea of creative destruction gave vigor to the quest for a theory of exchange. If one were to create before destroying something, one would be more likely to gain some audience. Mere criticism serves little purpose. 3.6.2.7\tKirzner on alertness This author\u2019s great teacher Israel Kirzner would make issues of high theory so clear that one would gasp. His notion of alertness provided the most important missing link in the theory of entrepreneurship. One could not fight \u2018rationality\u2019 without \u2018alertness\u2019. 3.6.2.8\tHayek on dispersed information The ability to see the organic relation between entrepreneurship and transaction cost, towards an idea that entrepreneurship in the pure capacity of the intermediary stands on reduction of transaction cost could ride on Hayek\u2019s notion of dispersal of pertinent information relevant to an exchange. Understanding arbitrage operations without first gathering the otherwise dispersed information would not occur. 3.6.2.9\tCoase on transaction cost An important building block of the theory of intermediation is the idea of transaction cost (Coase 1937, 1988). Ronald Coase provided a good starting point for its analysis. His idea of internalizing externality has enabled an exploration of the issues of legitimacy. The legal scholars have already acknowledged the value of his insights with respect of out-of-court conflict resolution. If one adds the ideas of Coase and Amartya Sen, one may gain faith in the concept of legitimacy that creates (political) entitlements. 3.6.3\tKeynesian ideas 3.6.3.1\tKeynes on the importance of money Keynes (1936) apparently was too impatient to sit down and work out the theoretical model to explain exactly how money affected output. Yet his ideas unleashed a revolution in thinking to give birth to a new branch of economics. He correctly identified the solution of involuntary unemployment caused by reduced aggregate expenditure. Like all hasty puddings that the hungry may swallow greedily, he introduced a set of ideas that obstructed clear thinking. In particular, the treatment of money as a store of value is a major roadblock in understanding monetary theory. Nonetheless, his emphasis on the causal relation between money and output provided a stout pillar to carry on the unfinished business of exploring the role money. The Wicksell Matrix offered an escape route. The transpose of the Wicksell Matrix locates exactly who must get and give how much money from and to whom. This matrix is named \u2018Keynes Matrix\u2019 in honor of Keynes. Had Keynes been sufficiently patient to work out the hidden Keynes Matrix, his message could be heard more loudly without room for doubt. 3.6.3.2\tSamuelson\u2019s optimal factor proportions Although rational optimization has no place in the analysis of exchange, it is still indispensable in analyzing production and consumption. Producers and consumers are essentially optimizers. Paul Samuelson is the great master of optimization analysis. If something of neoclassical synthesis survives the paradigm switch, it is the enduring significance of the optimal proportion of factors in production. Along with Leontief\u2019s idea of input-coefficients, the factor proportions may provide an interesting subject to understand the dynamics of output growth. 3.6.3.3\tSen\u2019s entitlement and idea of justice Economics is not a stand-alone subject. The notion of reciprocity and legitimacy builds on political philosophy articulated by one of the greatest political philosophers of all time: Amartya Sen. Economic policy can hardly be discussed without the guidance of Sen, especially regarding costs and benefits of projects. Some kind of just and fair balance between claims and obligations must become a key topic in all social sciences. Sen\u2019s idea of justice may be helpful in this exploration. 3.6.3.4\tBaumol\u2019s insistence on tractable theorems This author was a research assistant to William Baumol, the ever graceful gentleman scholar. Baumol taught how to make lucid presentations in easily grasped theorems. His guidance has been a constant inspiration to try to think thoroughly to develop an intelligible argument. 4\tThe classical paradigm Here is a short summary assessment of the scientific merit of classical economics. 4.1\tClassical ontology: crude, and incomplete The main architects of classical economics were serious and careful thinkers who sought to read reality. Adam Smith, Thomas Robert Malthus, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx were all serious seekers of knowledge. Classical economics was scientific, because it pursued realism. As a study of exchange, it was realistic, but crude. The crudeness consists of its failure to make a clear distinction between the ecology and the economy. Its incompleteness is found in the absence of recognition of the agent to agent relation of payment leading to the remarkably crude idea that money was a veil. Its glaring emptiness concerns the lack of a theory of intermediation, which was filled with a notion of invisible hand. The lack of intermediation theory comes from not seeing transaction cost. Classics could not see that a market cannot exist without merchants. They create the market by reducing transaction costs and making products affordable. They find customers for producers, who could not find them on their own. Adam Smith did not find a reason for the merchant to exist. He did not see that producers and consumers willingly rely on the merchant as he reduces transaction cost. The failure to understand the merchant had bad results. Karl Marx saw the great villain in the merchant. His villain robbed the producers and pauperized them into proletarian workers. This accusation enraged billions of people. They launched communist revolutions. People suffered and sacrificed greatly. They sadly brought calamities upon themselves. Dictator Kim Il Sung turned North Korea into his family property and destroyed its economy. In contrast, the merchants gave South Korea wealth and freedom. Classics also did not see money as a means of payment. They had no useful idea to see payment. Adam Smith\u2019s idea of unintended consequence is proof of lack of theory of payment. If Smith saw that the buyer paid for what he intended to get, he could not say that the buyer got benefits unintended by the seller. The benefit was intended by the buyer. Classical economics, never enriched by intermediation and payment theory, is too poor to serve today\u2019s smarter economists. It is too hard to understand the market events without the merchant and the means of payment. In contrast, consistent economics is easier. It tells a more complete story. It is better informed of the market operators, their actions to reduce costs, their innovations, organizations, risk-taking, and above all their feats of legitimization. It is better informed of the means of payment. It sees the market process through transfer of value and the transmission of effects of m on p and q. 4.2\tClassical epistemology: the failure of natural law Classical economics searched for laws of nature in the economy. In the prevailing climate of opinion, this was what responsible scientists were supposed to do. Sadly, natural law betrayed them. The blame belongs to nature, not to the faithful students of nature. Institutional law creates and governs the economy by repudiating natural law. Here is a brief account of the failure of natural a law. This modest attempt is to show some samples of supposedly natural laws in economics that do not work owing to human entrepreneurship. Let this remain limited to Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, plus Knut Wicksell and Milton Friedman (who were not classics). The human faculty of alertness enables them to do something to frustrate the operation of the laws of nature. The central story is that entrepreneurship involves a repudiation of the natural law. In its place, humans install institutional laws. Thus alert humans defeat the natural optimization to abort production of what they want to consume as they buy those from potential natural enemies rather than naturally plundering the producers. 4.2.1\tSmith Adam Smith articulated the (natural) law of the market in which the forces of demand balanced the forces of supply in equilibrium. This was a powerful idea to lay the foundations of economic science. However, it is primitive and crude compared to the far more sophisticated and nuanced articulation of reciprocal equivalence. The idea of a natural equilibrium suggested a policy implication with a strong message. Any imbalance between the forces of demand and supply would be self-corrected by price movements that would terminate the imbalance. Government intervention to fix the price would only perpetuate and worsen the imbalance. If the government took the side of the buyers and fixed the price at a low level, the supplies would be choked off and a state of perpetual shortage would emerge. In the reverse case, if the government took the side of the sellers and kept the prices high, it would kill off demand growth and a situation of perpetual oversupply would entail. Even with a crude formulation, economic science found something of profound significance. However, it did not go much beyond Smith in respect of valid ideas. Smith did not require price to do anything other than balance demand and supply. The neoclassical paradigm derailed the science by supposing erroneously that the price had to be equal to marginal cost from the supply side and marginal benefit from the demand side. That effectively takes away any reason for exchange, because there is no improvement if profit is zero in equilibrium. Sadly, the details of how the balancing between demand and supply work at multiple layers could not be grappled by Smith\u2019s primitive conceptualization. Here are some of the major pitfalls. 4.2.1.1\tThe propensity to plunder One of the most blatant lapses from objectivity occurs as Smith seeks to find the roots of the natural forces of demand and supply in the allegedly \u2018natural propensity to truck, barter, and exchange\u2019. As the most determined and competent hunting animal, human beings definitely have an undeniable propensity to plunder. The morally repugnant idea of slave trade as regular trade puts civilized humanity to shame. Slavery was surely plunder and absolutely never was it anything remotely close to trade. It revealed a peculiar truce among the powerful that could not take each other as slaves, but managed to buy and sell the powerless. Romans managed to take as slaves some who were themselves slave owners. The failure to see the natural propensity to plunder has led centuries of inattention to the modern techniques of plunder hidden behind the false facades of exchange. The revolutionaries that wanted to put an end to plunder did not detect the plunder as they looked elsewhere to discover class struggles. 4.2.1.2\tThe intermediaries In nature, the interplay of opposite forces does not require intermediation. Hence the Smithian worldview did not detect visible intermediaries who were engaged in coordinating the plans of strangers. Smith could not find an ethical rationale for the existence of merchants, and hence concocted the idea of an invisible hand behind the market coordination. This was a profound disrespect to the market leaders who cut down transaction costs (of information, organization, innovation, and legitimization) and made gainful trades possible that were naturally impossible. The mention of an invisible hand was the most naked lapse from scientific objectivity. In less skilful hands, the idea became pure superstition. 4.2.1.3\tThe intended consequences As a professor of moral philosophy, Smith probably had great trouble staying away from moral judgments. It was of no concern to science whether the realities were morally good or bad. But Smith wanted to stress that the pursuit of self-interest was nevertheless beneficial to society. Though the butcher or baker did not intend benevolence towards the consumers, the consumers nonetheless got the benefits (ostensibly of the low cost compared to what the consumers would incur if they had to produce the goods on their own). This is a mistake. The intention of the producer should have no relevance to the benefit derived by the consumer from the purchases. The intention of the consumer ought to have been considered. This would be a mere fine point that one could brush aside, had it not been for the tall claim based on a mistaken identity of intention. That was the claim that social institutions emerged spontaneously, without anybody intending it. This aborts the possibility of any society or of social science. If the pursuit of self-interest by the tiger and other predators would spontaneously create a heavenly jungle of giving unintended benefit to the prey, one might accept Smith\u2019s idea. But it is definitely false. Social institutions do not emerge spontaneously, but are created with untold sacrifices of great many people who deliberately try to persuade others to enact rules of conduct and institutions based on them. A cynic may insist that merchants do pursue self-interest even as they also cut down transaction costs that benefit the producers and consumers. That is where the cynic chronically misses the message. Other people rely on the merchants in order to take advantage of the benefits. One cannot dismiss the contributions of the merchants. Indeed, great pioneers of commerce were strong-willed people who decidedly sought to serve their people. To deny that is tantamount to saying that market leaders do not intend to lead. To forget the philanthropy of the likes of Henry Ford or Bill Gates is not a service to truth. 4.2.1.4\tThe costly freedom of enterprise For natural law to work, no human has to do anything. Nobody needs to do any work in order for the sun to shine or the rain to fall or the air to flow. This theme stays in the background among the lazy libertarians who believe in natural laws giving rise to human freedom. \u2018I born free I remain free\u2019 is the mantra of one who does not understand that freedom is the most precious accomplishment of a human in a world of cannibals all around him. The idea that passivity will be enough for positive outcomes is absurd. The freedom of enterprise is not natural: it has to be earned and defended at great cost. Relentless vigilance is needed to guard the freedom of enterprise from the plunderers feeding upon the stupefied morons attending the Tramp University to learn the Dirt of the Deal (where the real deal is to cheat the dim client.) 4.2.1.5\tThe payments Nature has no payments. Natural law simply does not work in case of payments. Adam Smith and his classical disciples could not figure out why money is not a veil, but a device to transfer value to enable indirectness in indirect trade. 4.2.2\tSay\u2019s Law Say\u2019s Law of the markets failed. Even though aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply, unemployment arises and persists if there is no money to allow indirect trades. The implicit natural law of market clearing does not work. Equality of demand and supply is not enough for market clearing. Something unnatural must happen to give rise to the market. Something unnatural must make it work. That unnatural part is reciprocity devised by the humans in defiance of the natural one-sided hunting. Say\u2019s Law fails because nature fails while society succeeds because it has institutional laws. Say\u2019s Law always works in the state of natural ecological subsistence. No animal in the ecology can be unemployed, simply because it works for itself. As long as natural law works in the ecology, Say\u2019s Law naturally holds. In case of barter, Say\u2019s Law may be violated in the short run when some mismatch between demand and supply may persist. But in the long run, demand will be equal to supply and unemployment cannot persist. Say\u2019s Law always fails under indirect trade. This is because indirect trade cannot occur without the unnatural phenomenon of transfer of value between perfect strangers. No indirect trade is possible without money, even if demand is equal to supply for every object of trade (and further if income is equal to expenditure for every agent) so that all factors will always remain unemployed (unless money arrives to allow the trades). There is no natural law of indirect trade with transfer of value. 4.2.3\tMalthus The Malthusian natural law of population works for all animals other than humans. Had natural law worked, the fear of a Malthusian disaster would mean that population would grow faster than food supply and people would be perpetually put back on bare survival at the lowest level of subsistence. But the economy repudiates natural law. In reality, food supply grew faster than human population and the life expectancy increased and fertility fell, defying the natural laws. It was a cruel betrayal to a solid scientist who worked hard with abiding faith in the laws of nature. Nobody could have argued against the two natural laws Malthus identified at the start of his population theory. Indeed, those two laws do operate on all populations except the human population. There is no question that the available food supply puts a limit on the maximum number of people that can stay alive on that amount of food. But the economy works unnaturally as commerce lets some people produce food in excess of their consumption needs. That is, natural law does not prevent the human population from being smaller than what the food supply can support. Biologists may carry out research to see if the human body size could attain largeness without plentiful food supply. Humans are one of the largest animals, larger than 99.99% of all animals. Had there been perpetual food crisis, the body size would have been smaller. It is highly likely that the woodland inhabitants were of smaller body size than their descendents who migrated to the grasslands as pastoralists. There is fossil evidence that archaic human species had smaller body sizes than their modern descendants. One might wonder if the ability to use stone tools permanently increased food productivity to allow the body size to become larger. And one may have little doubt that the invention of pastoralism allowed a significant improvement in body size and longevity owing to more assured supply of protein rich milk, meat, and eggs. And then agriculture vastly increased food availability. A further spurt in food productivity occurred with the arrival of machines running on natural energies to do the arduous work of land preparation. Did food supply put a brake on human population growth? It is more likely that lack of medication against infectious germs, bacteria, and virus set a limit on population size while food supply did not. Small pox alone killed more people than all the famines, wars, homicides, and natural disasters combined. Thus the failure of natural law with respect to the maximum population could occur because humans could unnaturally increase food supply. The failure of the second Malthusian natural law (on fertility) meant that the natural passion between the sexes could be frustrated by institutional laws. The natural fertility of a human mother is about 12.4 children. No community in human history ever reached that high limit. The highest recorded fertility rate occurred among Hutterites who avoided birth control for religious reasons to reach about 10.4 children per mother. Even before the concept of parity-specific contraception (with deliberate intention to limit the number of children), the actual fertility was about half of the natural rate. And the explanation is the presence of institutional law that restricted birth within marriage. The various customary practices of post-partum abstinence, prolonged period of breast-feeding of the infant (which prevented ovulation), restriction on widow remarriage etcetera kept the fertility low. All told, the natural law of population did not work. 4.2.3.1\tMarriage and the birth limitations The natural fertility rate does not care about any marital bond between the mates. But if humans by and large obey the institutional law that children are to be born within the limits of wedlock, the natural law is bound to fail. And it did fail. 4.2.3.2\tCommerce and the excess supply of food In the state of nature, the consumer must produce what he wants to consume. But the economy breaks out of the natural predicament by defying the natural law of subsistence to willingly produce food for strangers who can eat food without having produced it. Indeed, even as the real price of food (such number of hours of work to pay for a kilogram of rice) has been continuously falling since the beginning of industrial revolution, food supply has continuously grown faster than population. Commerce kills off the natural limit of subsistence output, by allowing people to produce far in excess of consumption needs (of the producers). Followers of Malthus generally failed to understand the reason for the failure of natural law. They concocted a notion of carrying capacity to define a so-called optimum population. But human enterprise defeats the carrying capacity by inventing technology in defiance of natural limitations of human productivity. Though the carrying capacity of the Bangladeshi flood plain with respect to cattle is identically zero, Bangladesh has a high density cattle population of over 22 million cows on a land surface of roughly 18 million arable acres, without much open pasture at all. The latest twist in the Malthusian panic is the idea of sustainable output. The claim is that although actual food supply growth has so far been above population growth, such a high rate is not sustainable, as the soil becomes less capable of growing food. This is plainly absurd. It is more absurd than the idea of carrying capacity. One of the biggest demerits of the idea of natural law regarding human population is that the proponents resolutely disregard factual evidence. Like the adolescents fond of fictional horror stories, the \u2018Frankenstein generation\u2019 of followers of Malthus imagines all kinds of horrors of technology. One horror is that there is a fixed set of non-reproducible resources that will soon run out. Failing on that bet, the new horror story has global warming and such other things. The newspapers in Bangladesh seem to constantly run stories of food being contaminated by all kinds of chemicals, with projections of serious health risks. But they all fail to notice that life expectancy has been rising very significantly, doubling in the last seventy years. They conveniently overlook the fact that when the only kind of food was organic food free from technological chemicals, the life expectancy was less than half of what the chemically drenched generation enjoys. Malthus was a serious scholar, but his followers do not display the same rigorous discipline in advancing phobic prognostications. Malthus had very little data to rely on, but he took whatever was available with utmost seriousness. His followers simply ignore pertinent data, though available in great abundance. If they were serious, they would see the horror stories of plunder. 4.2.3.3\tFrivolous consumption Perhaps the oddest defeat of natural law concerns the production and consumption of frivolous items such as shoelaces. The pious and kind-hearted reverend Malthus was horrified when he witnessed the heartbreaking miseries of the poor peasants kicked out of the lands as landlords put up enclosures to graze sheep for wool rather than let peasants grow corn. The peasants moved to cities, and squatted on unoccupied lands, and desperately looked for any kind of work that could earn the means of living. Malthus saw little kids working from sunrise to sunset in a shoelace factory, and earning a pittance. In the urban slums, the squalor and filth was horrifying. Life was much harsher than that enjoyed by peasants in the old villages. Malthus felt strong moral indignation. He proposed to burn those industries making frivolous items like shoelaces. He insisted that the natural occupation of man was to grow food. He demanded that the uprooted peasants must be resettled back in the village lands. The irony is that eventually, the explosive growth of frivolous consumption of all kinds of industrial products and all kinds of services including shocking manners of entertainment provided good livelihoods to the masses. Just a few people lingered in the villages and used urban machines to grow enormous quantities of foods in excess of the needs of the growing population. The biggest irony is that moral restraints did not suffice to rein population growth, but the intoxicating need for the frivolous shoelaces did. The need for a car and other frivolous toys that serve no natural purpose today takes up so much work of the urban professional that they cannot dare raise many children and equip them with those frivolities. That is, the shortage of food did not compel the parents to limit the number of children, but the shortage of the frivolous shoelaces did. One manner in which this works is that boys and girls go to college, and delay marriage so as to gain the ability to take part in the production of the frivolities. The pious professor Malthus sought a life of plain living with high thinking. Sadly, his modern day followers seemingly have endless appetite for frivolous and conspicuous consumption, though they whine about environmental degradation coming from the massive production of frivolities. It would be inspiring if the environmental jihadists would exhibit models of plain living and high thinking. But they tend to live in urban skyscrapers, and then lecture obese audiences in air-conditioned halls about the need to protect the Sundarban forests from electricity plants to keep the skyscrapers habitable. The hypocrisy of the environmentalist makes their message on frivolous consumption highly suspect. 4.2.4\tRicardo David Ricardo sought to formalize natural laws governing trades. His success was that he could demonstrate how the performance order (called comparative cost advantage) provided a basis for trade. However, his model was seriously incomplete. He did not consider the preference order from the demand side. His model left no room for indirect trade with intermediaries. With further refinements by Heckscher, Ohlin, and Samuelson, Ricardian trade theory ended up as a model of allocation with no room for entrepreneurship and intermediation, and no money as a means of payment. 4.2.4.1\tLabor theory of value fails The starkest sense of natural law found expression in Ricardo\u2019s theory of value. If capital is regarded as accumulated past labor, then the value of one product in relation to another would be naturally based on the labor content. This idea appealed strongly to Karl Marx. But it fails because the real observed labour is not identical: different workers incur different costs to produce the same thing. There is really no natural basis of relative price because exchange itself is unnatural. The failure of natural law beneath the labor theory of value renders a large bulk of the literature on value obsolete. 4.2.5\tMarx Karl Marx tried to formalize a comprehensive theory of society according to his understanding of natural law. Nobody surpassed him in influencing economic and social thought. His ideas provoked hundreds of millions of revolutionaries across the world to undertake struggles for socialism. The biggest nemesis of Karl Marx is the maligned intermediary (bourgeoisie) who finds ways of conflict resolution and finds points of agreement between natural adversaries for mutually beneficial trades. At a secondary level, the power of the artificial tool called money to facilitate transfer of value between strangers who do not know of each other\u2019s existence serves as a tool for welfare improvement. Marx thought of money as a device of plunder, as he did not see the full circulation path of money. To understand how natural law betrayed Marx and allowed the much maligned capitalistic economy to thrive, one may consider the destitution of the idealized primitive communism among the foragers. One then sees how the power of money breaks down the presumed class war between the capitalists and the workers. Lastly, one may remove the fear of the seed of self-destruction of the capitalist system by showing that the pursuit of profit can continue without self-destruction. However, plunder still occurs and there is a crying need to understand how it occurs. 4.2.5.1\tPrimitive communism persists The Marxian dictum \u2018from each according to ability to each according to need\u2019 did in fact correctly describe the natural human family that existed in the pristine forager days. However, this cannot be a feasible prescription for society beyond a family. They natural human family was naturally matrilineal, since there was no doubt about who the mother was, and that the mother always naturally behaved altruistically towards the children instead of acting selfishly. Daughters naturally stayed with their mothers throughout life and the family would be naturally extended to cover siblings. The natural repugnance to incest forced sisters to kick out brothers, who joined other non-native families. The natural family would be about 25 individuals of all ages and sexes with generational cohorts of sororities. There was a natural division of labor such that the adult males banded together for hunting expeditions while the girls moved about more slowly to gather vegetable materials, carrying the children and the sick with them. And the children would get the food even if they could not take part in its production. It all occurred naturally, not just in the human family, but also in the families of other animals. The family was founded on love and sex. It lacked surplus capital that could be the target of plunder. However, outside the family based on love, there is no reason for the Marxian dictum to work. A mother eagle is altruistic towards her own chicks. She works hard to feed and protect them. She kills the chicks of other species of birds to feed her own chicks. That is, there is a natural distinction between family and strangers. This means that the Marxian dictum does not work beyond the family. Thus Ceausescu or Kim IL Sung would have no hesitation to cheat other proletarians of their communist societies to enrich members of the family. Socialist workers exhibited chronic lack of enthusiasm for hard work, because they did not feel any urge to work hard for strangers. In reality, one worker can brutally oust another just because the other is a stranger. The dictum still works inside the family. However, the modern family is nucleated and not the extended clan of the forager era. A cynic may dispute even that much, citing endless instances of fathers who refuse to make child support payments to divorced wives, and brothers killing brothers to gain heritable properties. The betrayal here is that so long as nature works, it defeats the foundation of a society based on the Marxian dictum. A society works according to institutional laws to the extent that those laws are enforced. It does not work automatically. 4.2.5.2\tThe disintegration of class A key part of the dynamics of the natural law of society is the Marxian nation of dialectical materialism, making the conflicting forces fighting it out until the dominant class is obliterated by its opposite. This is a dynamic process of a kind of zero sum game such that as one side gains power, the other side loses it. This idea crucially depends on the notion of a class and its interest. Marx sees that the interests of the capitalist class cannot be reconciled with that of the working class of laborers, so that the only available option is war. His dream is that the revolutionary organization of the working class of proletarians will forcibly overthrow the exploiters and establish a society where capital is owned socially and the dictum is from each according to ability to each according to need. A classless society will then emerge. The problem with this view is that there is really nothing to form a class based on economic interests. In the neoclassical jargon, economics agents are essentially engaged in the pursuit of self-interest (of the household) and not in pursuit of class interest. The idea that lumpen proletariats betray their class in favor of the enemy sounds much like a preacher lamenting the sinners. The problem is a failure to identify the nature of individual interest. The quest for means of sustenance (naturally being food) is inherently individualistic and not attuned to some concept of class. That people inside the family do actually care and share has an explanation in the blood-based genetic predisposition that does not extend beyond the family. There is nothing to say why an individual will pursue the interest of the class if it conflicts with his self-interest. The classes disintegrate in the face of the onslaught of the bourgeoisie who carry out arbitrage and seigniorage operations to resolve conflicts and arrange mutually gainful commercial cooperation. Marx could not see how capital and labor coexist peacefully. Economic interest need to be specified in terms of claims and obligations. It is hard to detect class interest in the specific configuration of claims and obligations in exchange activities. In short, there may be no meaningful class interest in case of the economy. It is also questionable whether political parties can be said to have class interests. The idea of a Trumpian class of American voters may be a source of perennial laughs for late night comedy shows. It cannot be a serious subject for a scholar. 4.2.5.3\tProfit without exploitation The Marxian concept of class relied on another pillar of natural law being the self-destructive pursuit of profit. In a highly simplistic concept of monetary circulation, Marx detected the seeds of self-destruction of the capitalist system. For example, in a capitalist economy, the capitalists may have a stock of 100 dollars of money. They spend this money to buy up the product of the working class. Then they seek to sell back the products for 120 dollars, assuming a profit of 20 dollars. But the workers have only 100 dollars of wages. The pursuit of profit cannot be sustained. The capitalist system is doomed to self-destruction. A more complete study of circulation of money shows clearly that it is possible for every seller to earn a profit essentially because the very process of exchange enables gains from trade. The market process works relentlessly towards allocating the production jobs to those who can produce the goods at the lowest costs. It also rations the products to those who can pay the highest prices, signalling the strongest preferences. Profit is possible just because the producer\u2019s cost of production is much lower than the same for the consumer. The prices are not set by labor theory of value at all, and the zero-profit equilibrium based on prices reflecting labor content is not a reflection of commerce at all. Communism is feasible only if the household practices subsistence production. But that assures absolute poverty shared by all. 4.2.5.4\tThe plundering seigneurs Karl Marx paid attention to the plunder. It is of course natural for a hunting animal to plunder. However, the presence of the state as a social device to resist plunder in the modern context may raise the issue of how plunder can still occur. The followers of Marx may be doing justice to their beliefs if they embark on a serious scrutiny of how the issuers of money may carry out plunder. The issues of royal counterfeiting may be addressed first. Deficit financing through issuance of treasury bills must also be seriously studied. The next on agenda should be the issue of counterfeiting by issuing loans against collateral of existing property rather than against the output of the project financed by the loan. The next set of investigations should compare long and short circulation of money to see how long circulation systematically robs the cash-starved in favor of the cash-deluged. 4.2.5.5\tPurchasing power disparity Marxian scholars have a job to find evidence of plunder in the disparity of purchasing power owing to monopolization of international money. They need to examine the option of creating a World Money Bureau. That Bureau would issue perfect fiat e-money to nations according to their exports. The issue of exchange rate alignment would become pointless. 4.2.6\tWicksell The mention of Wicksell and Friedman in respect of natural law is somewhat stretching it a bit. They were not concerned with natural law to the same degree of seriousness that Smith or Malthus or Marx cultivated. They did not offer the same penetrating insights or exert the same lasting influences. Yet it may be worthwhile to mention them to show that natural law does not work even in small degrees. 4.2.6.1\tNatural rate of interest There is confusion regarding the precise meaning of the term interest rate. The term \u2018natural rate of interest\u2019 is not free from ambiguity as to what it refers to. The bigger problem is that neoclassical price theory (in which price equals marginal cost of supply and marginal benefit of demand) cannot be sustained. The existence of the intermediary carrying out arbitrage and seigniorage operations kills off the marginal equalities. One may dispute the idea of interest rate sensitivity of savings deposits in banks. The Islamic Bank does not pay interest, and yet its deposit base keeps growing at a higher rate than other banks that do offer interest. One may of course say that Islamic bank rewards savers in other ways, namely pays interest under other names. The crucial problem is that unless one makes clear identification of capital, credit, and (fiat) money, one cannot assess the interest rates for those different entities. Owing to intermediation, none of those prices can be natural. 4.2.7\tFriedman Friedman\u2019s appeal to natural law seems perfunctory at best. His endorsement of the idea of statistical inference based on least squares is a red flag that he did not believe in the remorseless error-free operation of natural law, in total rejection of the notion of randomness. 4.2.7.1\tNatural rate of unemployment One may debate the correctness of the term \u2018natural rate of unemployment\u2019. In the state of nature, the natural law of subsistence does not allow any unemployment. Every animal must be employed in the production of the means of sustenance, even if that production involves hunting and gathering. Unemployment is fully unnatural. Historically, subsistence economies did not even have a term for the event that did not occur and could not be imagined to occur. The prefix 'un' and the suffix 'ment' in the term clearly points out that this word was coined recently. In the Bengali language, there is no term for unemployment. A Farsi word \u2018be-gar\u2019 (be=without; gar=earning) has been imported and corrupted (as bekar) to denote an unemployed person. Wasow (1976) learned that Kenyans had no term for unemployment until recently. Unemployment can occur even if demand is equal to supply for each tradable good, and even if the ex ante income is equal to ex ante expenditure for each agent, if money is absent to allow the requisite transfer of value under indirect trade. This is a serious problem. It means that all factors of production will always remain unemployed if those are earmarked for production of indirectly traded output. It also means that a factor cannot be called unemployed if there is no demand for it. In that case, the factor is unemployable. The classical idea that workers would be unemployed if they ask for wages above equilibrium is counter-factual. There is no sensible worker who would embrace unemployment rather than work at the available wage. In reality, no depression began as a result of sudden madness of workers who suddenly demanded unreasonably high wages and ended up fired. Just the opposite occurred. A spate of bankruptcies or other forms of financial meltdown dried up the money supply and choked expenditure flows to compel employers to lay off workers because they could not sell the output. The workers begged to remain at work, voluntarily offering wage cuts to help out the employers, but in vain. Keynes put his finger on the real problem, but without clear theoretical explanation. If the expenditure is reduced, unemployment occurs. His solution was to increase the expenditure flows. Friedman\u2019s participation in the debate occurs as a result of a strange twist in Keynesian theory of unemployment. Though a distinction between demand for consumer goods and capital goods has really no bearing because every product is both an input and an output, Keynes sought to explain why expenditure would decline. His idea is that people would on the whole keep spending on consumption, but may suspend spending on capital goods if they fear that the future prospect of the investment is bleak. So he supposed that the private sector would have the money earmarked for saving, but that will be withheld from expenditure if expectations discourage investment. The twist occurs because Keynes is not sure that monetary policy will work, because the private households already have the money they refuse to spend on investment, as they are caught in liquidity traps. Monetary policy cannot induce them to borrow and spend on investments. Consequently, he favors fiscal policy in which the government takes up the task of spending on public investments, as if the government is fearless about the future. Even when shortage of money is the culprit, monetary policy is fruitless, as if money does not matter. The job for Friedman is to say that money matters. The twist here is to dispute the Keynesian idea that increasing the money supply will reduce the unemployment rate. Using empirical analysis, Friedman makes a compelling case that money does have effect on real output in the short run, but not in the long run. In the long run, the effect on output evaporates, but the effect on inflation persists. The idea of natural rate of unemployment refers to the minimum unemployment rate that persists no matter how much inflation is there. For the United States, the estimated natural rate of unemployment is 4.2 %. The theoretical point is this. Money has relevance only to involuntary unemployment that occurs even when demand for labor is equal to supply. The theory should clarify if money fails to affect involuntary unemployment. But there is voluntary unemployment that cannot be affected by manipulating money supply. The empirical issue is to estimate the size of voluntary unemployment. The question now is: did Friedman confuse voluntary and involuntary unemployed by using the term natural rate of unemployment (which ought to be called the rate of voluntary unemployment). Theoretically, voluntary unemployment is not unemployment as there is no supply of labor regardless of the wage rate. Workers exist but do not wish to work. 4.2.7.2\tStructural unemployment As economic development occurs, the economy undergoes structural transformation. This requires many workers to move from one occupation to another, and often from one place to another. To join a growing sector from a stagnant or declining one, one may need to go through re-education and retraining. During this period of transition, many people are out of jobs. This is structural unemployment. There is no a priori reason for structural unemployment to take a particular rate. Empirical studies may look for localized and temporary forces of change that may underlie the elasticities of transitional movements of labor from one occupation to another. One particular aspect of structural unemployment has been misunderstood seriously. When rural people move to new towns where they do not have familiar social networks to help them settle into new occupations, a period of unemployment is inevitable. Jobs are not generic commodities of impersonal character. Each worker must be personally suited to the particular occupation. There is an element of trust at stake. A reliable reference is often a necessary condition of employment. And this is not something that happens easily. The Harris-Todaro model (See Harris and Todaro 1970) of rural to urban migration mistook this structural unemployment and proposed the existence of institutional distortion for the unemployment. A famous historian of thought supposed that India was wasting money on producing too many college graduates who did not find jobs the moment they got their degree awards. One needed to ask whether a fresh graduate is supposed to get a job without going through a period of search. After all, matching the jobseeker with the job description is not a simple thing. Many people do a kind of trial and error, changing jobs in order to ultimately settle in one that suits the individual employee. International migrants often face daunting challenges in their job searches. It is quite simply a scenario of high transaction cost of gathering the dispersed information. Great many job vacancies persist while the people suited to those jobs fail to approach the employers. Various kinds of assistance with job search may help ease the mismatch. A simple matter of writing a proper CV for job interview may mean the difference between getting and not getting a job. It is possible to suppose that the quantum of structural unemployment and the length of the period of such unemployment may be reduced if institutional support is provided to jobseekers as well as to employers looking for manpower. There is little of theory in this regard. 4.2\tClassical methodology The notion of equilibrium is suited to the natural mechanism. With the proviso that institutional law would better use the term agreement in place of equilibrium, one can see that classical economics was methodologically sound. The proper method of showing how natural law works is to analyze the state of equilibrium. The classical paradigm did not embrace the blasphemy of probabilistic conjectures. It carefully shunned what was merely conceivable inside the head without something perceptible outside of it. 4.3\tRhetoric: verbal logic Classical authors generally took great care to argue their points. Verbal arguments seem to have fallen in disfavor after a long period of mathematical stupefaction. However, a reader who cares to sit down and read through Amasa Walker\u2019s textbook (1865) or Arthur Cecil Pigou\u2019s textbook \u2018Economics of Wealth and Welfare (1920) would not fail to be convinced. The key trouble with classical economics is its severely incomplete ontology (the description of the character of exchange) and the improper epistemology of causality. 4.4\tAustrian economics: a short comment Perhaps one might regard Austrian School economics as a distinct paradigm. This author likes to think this as a continuation of the classical tradition with a key change in epistemology. The great communicator of the Austrian School is Ludwig von Mises (1949), who emphatically treats economics as a study of exchange, and approvingly cites Whately and the term catallactics coined by Whately (1832). The verbose exposition of the logic of action (called praxeology) often gives the impression that the theorems are derived a priori. Hence it is not easy to convince opponents that Austrian economics is indeed realistic: it starts from the observed reality of exchange. Austrian economics definitely enriched the study of exchange, especially with regard to the dynamics of the market process. It is not clear whether the school adopts natural mechanistic law (working through the individual mind of the entrepreneurial and alert human) or its alternative teleological law. There is teleology on the surface, but not thoroughly so in the depths. The focus on the individual robs it of the vitality of epistemological success of causality. A single individual cannot determine the exchange outcome because it is essentially a social outcome based on choice of multiple individuals with conflicting preferences, perceptions, and expectations. Freedom of enterprise is a social rule that allows each individual to pursue the individual\u2019s intention, and yet the individual intention does not determine the equilibrium outcome based on the participation of many individuals who have necessarily incompatible intentions, perceptions, and expectations. Philosophers will debate long and hard on the issue of whether social laws restrict what the individual may do. The abstract concept of a binding constraint is the issue. A concrete example is that there is an electric equipment to make dough. Of course no dough can be made without the required ingredients such as the flour, the sugar, the oil, water et cetera. But when there is no electricity, no dough can be made even when the required ingredients are available in sufficient quantities. Electricity is the binding constraint that limits how much dough can be produced in such a case. When multiple people jointly do something, individual intentions do not become the binding constraints, but the social rules do. Individual intentions cannot override the social rule that the buyer must pay the seller and pay nobody else. Hence who pays whom is not determined by who intends what, but by the social rule. This is where Austrian School economics gets bogged down. The obstinate insistence on subjectivism prevents the school from recognizing the existence of intermediaries who manage the transfer of claims and obligations between strangers by using money as a device to allow such transfers. The founder of the school- Carl Menger- fought a long battle with the historicists. This may have led to a rigid mindset. This may have given a stiff unwillingness to acknowledge the existence of institutions and institutional laws. The ideological fear is that an institutional law may be device to curtail personal liberty and even be a fascist threat. This creates a very acute self-contradiction. Despite the claim that entrepreneurs act purposefully and deliberately, the school accepts the odd idea that institutions emerge spontaneously. The spontaneous origin of money is a peculiar theory that contradicts teleology by smuggling in mechanism. Just as clouds form spontaneously without any human design and intention, so do institutions grow spontaneously, and so does money emerge. This is not compatible with deliberate action. And this is not consistent with facts. The school clearly adopts the view that intermediaries exist as arbitrageurs, and yet does not recognize the seignior who deliberately creates fiat money and issues it to manage claims and obligations between perfect strangers. This once again occurs because the school does not acknowledge the existence of society and social law so that it cannot confess that a buyer incurs a social obligation to pay the seller and the seller earns a claim on the buyer for a payment only because there is a society ready to enforce the claim. The unwillingness to read history may have contributed to the inability to see that before the emergence of the market as a social institution, individual-centric ecology allowed perpetual plunder rather than purchase. Society is an engineered artifice to suppress the savage impulses of nature. Money is certainly an engineered device. The school\u2019s commitment to teleology (which entails deliberate engineering) is unsure. It is possible that the libertarian ideology prevents the school from recognizing deliberate pre-planned action. If there is no society, there is nothing to compel an individual to pay a weak owner rather than heroically plunder him. People are certainly not born with \u2018a natural propensity to truck, barter, and exchange\u2019 (as Adam Smith presumed), but are certainly born with a hunting instinct to plunder the weak. In short, the focus on the individual prevents one from seeing the paradox that a society is a collection of individuals with antagonistic intentions and perceptions, and yet people can live peacefully and take part in joint acts to fulfil opposite intentions. Alertness is the saviour. Hence one has the issue of ontology: does Austrian economics fulfil objectivity? The key problem of Austrian epistemology is once again the missing sense of society and its institutions (rules of conduct). The Austrian scholar must seriously ask: is exchange subject to social rules or not? 5.\tThe neoclassical paradigm In this exercise, neoclassical economics refers to the economics that stands on the idea of rational optimization. Its bible is Marshall\u2019s Principles (Marshall 1890). Microeconomics is the core of it. The major architects are Alfred Marshall, William Jevons, Leon Walras, Vilfredo Pareto, John Ronald Hicks, Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, Kenneth Arrow, Robert Lucas and others. Neoclassical economics fails to qualify as a science on all counts. Its ontology is completely empty of reality. Its epistemology does not exist: there is no search for any kind of law of causation. It is seriously flawed in its rhetoric for its mindless adoption of probabilistic conjectures. Causality requires certainty and neoclassical rhetoric fails entirely in delivering certainty. Its rhetoric is dishonest: instead of making people wiser, it wants them to be stupefied by fantastic stories of dynastic utility functions, self-fulfilling prophecies, and the like. It is useful to consider the distinction between economic theory (as science) and economic policy (as art). The mainstream economic profession is caught in an uneasy combination of \u2018theory without data\u2019 and \u2018data without theory\u2019. Economic science appears in textbooks as economic theory (microeconomics, macroeconomics, trade theory, monetary theory, mathematical economics, and econometrics). This body is devoid of data. The discourses on economic policy are often embodied as reports and journal articles with empirical contents. Applied economics such as those dealing with economic development, population, agriculture, health, industry, energy, transport et cetera are generally well conversant with data-based narratives of current realities. Hence an accusation that neoclassical economic science is unrealistic may startle practitioners of applied economics. The problem is that economic science is supposed to be the source of guidance for policy. But since the science claimed in theoretical textbooks cannot be applied to realities, the empirical studies tend to be strange cases of scientific investigations instead of being scientific applications. An illustration may help see the difference. A scientist learns, after thorough and careful analysis of observed realities under duly controlled experiments exactly why and how a television signal is transmitted and intercepted and how sights and sounds are turned into signals, which in turn can be reconstituted to reproduce the sights and sounds. The scientific knowledge is applied to create and operate the television. A television mechanic of course learns the science from the scientist, but he does not embark on further investigation to learn about finer details of signal propagation and interception. He is trained to apply the knowledge. He checks a malfunctioning TV set, identifies the defect, and applies proper remedies (such as replacing damaged parts by a functioning part, or properly reinstalling various connections of cables and other components.) An applied economist, comparable to the TV mechanic, is supposed to have the scientific knowledge regarding how his entity of application works. Microeconomics gives him zero knowledge about how health or transport or energy or agriculture is supposed to behave. There is no knowledge to apply. To fill the knowledge-void, he is bound to try to gain knowledge, without the requisite competence or training. It is akin to the situation where a TV mechanic who has been given no knowledge of how the TV set works is charged with repairing the set through inventions. Applied economists are all in this terrible condition: their teachers have given them no knowledge, but asked them to guess. Without the guidance of proper theory, the practical economist is unable to interpret the data. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a UN agency, conducted a ten year study in 114 countries, covering nearly 95% of the human population. After gathering mountains of data, the agency laid an essentially empty egg of theory. How the authors reached their conclusions is anybody\u2019s guess. Their advice: learn how to get rich from those who have never been rich. It just did not occur, even after ten years of thinking, that to get rich, one should learn from those who got rich, like in industry and service outside agriculture. Having read the mountains of data showing that agriculture was shrinking its share in GDP, and 92% of the hungry people are food producers because the relative price of food is falling in the face of perpetual overproduction, the authors proposed further boosting production, and especially by harnessing traditional knowledge that had always kept them poor. A very tragic case refers to a truly outstanding scholar of demography. It is doubtful if any person ever will have studied more data on population than Frank Notestein. He is almost literally the grand man of modern demography. His super tall personality with high influence allowed a world bitterly splintered by a World War to reach a global agreement to set up the UNFPA in 1950 to study population. But when it came to offering theory, he just disregarded all the data and explained fertility decline by mentioning \u2018the rise of the son to the detriment of the family\u2019 and women\u2019s determination to break \u2018the shackles of motherhood\u2019 though he had no data on the son\u2019s rebellion or the daughter\u2019s breaking of the shackle. A trained theorist could use Notestein\u2019s data to develop a flawless theory of fertility decline and associated matters of demographic change. For this, Marshall and Pareto must bear the blame: they did not prepare Notestein to do the work that he spent his life to do. \u2018Minimize this and maximize that\u2019 gave absolutely nothing to handle population and related economic data at all. If Notestein had to read Malthus (1798), then what was the point of Marshall (1890) writing another book nearly a century later? Here is another disastrous example. A desperate government asks an applied economist to solve a desperate problem: massive unemployment in the cities. With the highest academic degree from one of the most prestigious universities, the economist is at a loss to understand what is happening. Without any guidance on how to build theory, he guesses that rural migrants arriving in endless numbers has to be the cause of urban unemployment, and sending them back to the villages has to be the solution. His teachers themselves are illiterate in science, and the economist cannot read the data properly, and cannot interpret what he sees. He sees what is not there, and he does not see what is there to see, because he does not have the (epistemological) training to see properly. He is honoured for his advice and the government starts putting his advice into practice: capture the recently-arrived migrants, and put them on trucks back to their villages. But the migrants return after a while, and the policy fails, after causing untold miseries, and many atrocities that should never have occurred. Had there been an iota of economic science in the famous universities, the applied economist could fulfil his life\u2019s ambition of having helped a large number of real people find good jobs and enjoy good lives. He could spend his retirement reminiscing the good times he was the frontline warrior on a war on poverty and unemployment, a war he won decisively. But without the guidance of science, the defeated warrior sighs that his life has been a series of shameful failures, and catastrophic defeats. In that missing iota of economic science, he would have learned that economic development necessarily involves a structural transformation, which makes traditional villages with traditional agriculture obsolete. In place of the old villages, new cities have to appear, where the people are trained and equipped to work in industry ad service, and live where they work, with all kinds of facilities and amenities to live their lives fully. Traditional villages fully disappear, but in their places, new urban outposts of modern agriculture take shape. These outposts are not swarming with illiterate, hungry, and naked people. These outposts are places where the farmer has his private jet, and his private silo with thousands of tons of food, and his bank account with hundreds of millions of dollars of credit to finance the enormous range of monstrous agricultural equipment operated by a small number of highly paid operators working on thousands of acres of land. Urban people, with knowledge and skill gained in the cities, and with tools and technologies developed in the cities, run modern agriculture. There are no more any sign of landless peasants, small and marginal farmers at all. The farms are large and well endowed with all forms of capital. This is the picture of a mature developed economy that has ended the days of rural stagnation. With that iota of science, the applied economist would know that rural development is impossible. The goal of development is not to develop the rural land, but to develop the rural people. A village that does not a have full blown university, and full-fledged hospital where every disease can be expertly handled is not developed. The goal of development is to turn the son of peasant into a justice of the high court, and the daughter of a landless peasant into the chair of the board of trustees of a university. The goal of development is to rescue people from a life on the mud and the dust, where they work under the blistering sun and the torrential rain for a pittance. The goal is to take them to where they can be more productive, more honoured, and more powerful. And that place is the city. But without that iota of science, the applied economist sees over-urbanization in direct contradiction of the evidence that there is severe under-urbanization as the aspirants cannot find places to live, and amenities to enjoy lives in the small congested cities. The appearance of the slums is the sign that the city is too small relative to the need of urban expansion. The evidence of history is that the new discoveries in science are extraordinary feats that may occur to just a few individuals. The great good luck of humanity is that science is shared knowledge so that if just one man ever discovers how antibiotics can fight bacteria and virus, all others can share the same knowledge with great ease, and apply them. Just one Newton is good enough to get a theory of gravitation: billions and billions of others can just get the same knowledge as a gift because knowledge can be communicated through human language. Just one Edison can show how to make an electric bulb, and then all humanity can take advantage of this knowledge. This exercise does not judge the empirical work done by the mainstream authors that subscribe to neoclassical theory. The point is that proper science is desperately needed to help the practical economists go out and solve real life problems. Applied economists are not responsible to develop economic theory: in contrast, they are entitled to learn economic theory. The sad story is that neoclassical economics does not have a component that can be regarded as economic science. Empirical work is supposed to help applied economics design policies. The empirical work, being data without theory, desperately requires guidance of theory for interpretation of data. Economic journals are filled with endless articles on diverse economic realities, where the authors forget their real job: explaining why a proposed policy will necessarily and sufficiently yield the desired outcomes. Instead, they test hypotheses after hypothesis as if they have the job of discovering how the entity behaves. Experiments in laboratories take years of patient observation, and the scientists indeed do check various possibilities, but they do not publish the unfinished work. Indeed, even when Newton (a proper scientist) was sure of his findings on spectrum, he waited thirty years before publishing. It is tragic that people who have no business discovering science (but have the duty to apply the known discoveries) do something entirely futile and pointless, and in great haste. Statistical inference has no validity as a method of scientific investigation simply because it presumes that things occur randomly without cause. Yet the journal editors seemingly insist that the empirical articles must use the absurdity of hypothesis testing and statistical inference. The ability to make scientific discoveries is indeed rare. Who knows how Newton managed to discover something that is true for all physical entities throughout the universe and for all eternity. It is obvious that Newton could not possibly carry out empirical studies on everything. He could however distil the essential elements that constitute the force of gravitation, as he could think. By virtue of the law of identity, all things that are identical must behave identically. Hence the principal task is to discover the identity, also called essence (the necessary and the sufficient condition of existence or occurrence). If one knows how to discover the character of one single drop of water, he can apply his discovery to all the oceans of water without further ado, because the law of identity ensures that all drops of water are the same. An economic scientist cannot possibly experience (empirically observe) every instance of exchange. Yet he can identify the essential character of exchange. Much of it comes from thinking deeply and widely and long and hard about the abstract notion of necessity and sufficiency. Here is an example of how to think about necessity. One takes 1000001 marbles of identical shape, size, and weight (1 gram), and drops all of them from a given height. Intuitively, people expect all of them to hit the ground at the same instant, and they do. Now, there is a question that Galileo would ask and ordinary people would not ask. Galileo would take 1000000 marbles and fuse them into one large marble of 1 ton=1 million grams. If two marbles, one being one gram and the other being one million grams are dropped at the same instant, ordinary intuition suggests that the marble weighing 1 ton will fall faster than the one with just 1 gram. But the question Galileo asks is why would putting a million marbles together make a difference? Why would they fall faster by the mere act of being together rather than being separate? Is there any necessity for the first 1 ton to fall faster than the second 1 ton just because the first ton falls in one piece while second falls in 1 million pieces? That is, the issue is: does compactness (being moulded together) constitute a causal difference for gravitation of the same mass (1 ton)? Here is an example of what an honest professor of microeconomics must think. The question is: what determines how much of x a buyer buys? Buying is not consuming and hence the other question: what determines how much of x a consumer consumes is a different question. Now, a dutiful scientist must think that the issue of buying is a comparison between buying versus producing (including production by plunder). A buyer buys something to reduce the cost of procurement by comparing the cost of procurement by production and that by purchase. There is no question of maximizing utility, because buyer need not even consume the good he buys. 5.1\tNeoclassical ontology: nothingness On ontological grounds, neoclassical economics (NE) does not qualify as science. It has no economic reality to study. Individual optimization of course occurs in the pre-economic ecology, but it has no connection to any economic matter involving buying, selling, paying and receiving payment, and intermediation. Exchange begins by defeating optimization. By the way, the biological natural law of subsistence is an infinitely superior explanation of ecological production and consumption than a model of optimization. 5.2\tNeoclassical epistemology: lawlessness The main architects of neoclassical paradigm are not guilty of pursuit of knowledge. They wanted to entertain themselves. It is great fun to be able to write first and second order conditions of optimization, and to talk endlessly about continuity, differentiability, convexity, inflexion points, fixed points, and so on. There is simply no sense that some kind of explanatory law must govern how the real world behaves. In short, there is no epistemology at all. There is no real world outside the head: it is all inside the head. Hence there is no concern with a law that governs the real world outside the head. NE brought two seductive ideas. One was that the individual was the source of economic decisions. The optimization tool made spell-binding presentations of how individuals made decisions. The other was subjectivism. People\u2019s intentions, perceptions, and expectations told them what to do. Both ideas stupefied the profession. The first made the individual independent of society. It put him outside the economy and firmly in the ecology. The second took away the spirit of science. It drowned the profession in the abyss of hypotheses about unseen states of mind. Consistent economics throws away optimal choice of solitary optimizers by taking in consistent choice of entrepreneurs. It makes short work of subjectivism, as it obeys institutional rules. These rules bring universal regularity of market events regardless of the state of mind. It keeps nothing of NE. 5.3\tNeoclassical methodology: faking Instead of making the audience wiser by virtue of carefully cultivated knowledge, the neoclassical paradigm effectively stupefies people by reckless unreason. It pretends to know what it merely imagines. The idea that methodology is the logic of the method to ensure that the cause works to satisfy both necessity and sufficiency is unknown to the neoclassical paradigm. The neoclassical fun lovers cultivate the attitude of \u2018anything goes\u2019 without any concern with necessity and sufficiency. Their embrace of randomness reveals that they do not care about causality at all. They are fond of cooking up plausible and implausible hypothesis. The neoclassical methodology works very hard to make a random hypothesis, gather entirely irrelevant data, and cook up this and that thoroughly meaningless coefficient. This is a painful exercise to criticize bad theory. If one compares a genuine model with a fake, here is something one might see. First, a genuine scientist might wish to explain economic development. Even if the only explanatory model was that of rational optimization, one might still manage the following. (Please see the appendix on power of rational optimization for a fuller exposition.) Economic development is a sustained increase in per capita output. So, one finds something that is both necessary and sufficient to increase per capita output. To assure that it sustains, one shows that output grows in equilibrium. After long and hard inquiry, one decides that per capita output can increase if each person becomes more productive than before. With new knowledge, a person gains skill. And he may fashion the tool to produce more output from the same old basket of factors. Hence new knowledge is sufficient to increase per capita output. One then appeals to rationality. A rational man who knows that he can produce more will not fail to produce more. Now, one asks: is this necessary? This is a harder question. One wonders if a person may become richer just because he happens to get a larger endowment of factors without greater skill or better technology. Then one sees that factor endowment cannot generally increase per person. Indeed, the planet\u2019s endowment of natural resource is fixed. Then one notices that the same planet that once could not feed a small population now feeds nearly 8 billion. Technology and skill gives people more output from the same basket of natural resources. One may also see the esoteric reason. If output of food can increase without an increase in land, then land is not relevant. Something else is. That something has to do with new knowledge that enables people to use chemical fertilizers or irrigation or better techniques. Then one realizes that new knowledge indeed is necessary. But economic development is a complex process. Many changes take place at once. One must explain all of them with the same explanatory scheme. One would seek to show how new productive knowledge gives rise to economic development such that the average person has more human capital (higher skill level) and a greater amount of physical capital or better tools. One does not need a separate theory of human capital investment, or technological progress. The essence of new knowledge lies in higher skill, and better tools complementing the skills. Economic development always means structural change. Development does not mean that people just produce more food than before. They want industrial goods and services too. One sees that while the planet has more than enough land to allow more food, it seems not to have enough energy to let people make more industrial goods and services. Then one sees that new knowledge enables them to harness natural energy to do the work they can barely do with muscular energy. With natural energy, they can produce and consume more industrial goods. There is a change in the structure of output. Manufactures increase at a faster rate than food. One needs no additional assumption to explain structural change. One finds that an agent produces and consumes food and cloth. Now, if one\u2019s resources constrain cloth production more severely than food production, one\u2019s optimization with new knowledge will reduce the constraint on cloth production more than on food production. One will produce more of both goods, but one will increase cloth output at a higher rate than that of food. If one cares, one can figure out why. People are relatively satisfied with the food they can produce, but not with the cloth. They want much more cloth, but they lack the energy to produce a lot more. Hence they look for ways to overcome energy shortage more eagerly than land shortage. A rational person will like to overcome the harder constraint than the easier one. It is the same as people trying to get more marginal benefit from the use of the new knowledge in the production of one good than another. If food is relatively abundant while cloth is relatively scarce, the marginal benefit of another bundle of cloth will be higher than that of the food one can grow with the same resource cost. If cloth production increases relative to food, people will of course move to places where cloth production is easier to do. That place is the town. One does not need any additional assumption about what people think to explain why they produce cloth in factories rather than in the farmland. One knows that factories tend to cluster in towns owing to economies of scale, scope, and nearness. Does one need a behavioral assumption to explain why people go to rivers rather than to the deserts to catch fish? One needs no theory of migration. People will go to work where work exists. People will of course choose whether to work in farms or factories according to what they expect to earn. Rationality can directly give one a general theory of migration: from woodland to grassland, to cropland, to factory towns. In each case, new knowledge finds new work in new locations. Invention of animal breeding means that people move to grasslands to breed animals than in the woodlands. Invent agriculture, and go to where agriculture can be done. Then invent machines to run factories and go to where the machines are best located. No behavioral change is needed. The discovery of new location of work (=new knowledge) is needed. And then one also realizes that if people can invent medicines to cut down mortality, they may have good reason to cut down fertility too. As they go to town, and get into colleges to learn skills suited to urban industrial and service work, they delay marriages compared to rural folks who have no reason to delay marriages. This delay reduces fertility. In addition, as they pick up urban jobs, they also want their children to gain the skills for urban professions. The cost of giving education is very high. The urban parents reduce the number of children and greatly increase their quality. One does not need any additional behavioral assumption to say this. So far, one would be doing something sensible, even with the simplistic notion of rational optimization. But if one is an addicted game player, one plays the reckless game of optimization with arbitrary assumptions. One just loves to make assumption after assumption. One does not believe that science forbids making assumptions altogether. Science mandates that one must observe and control what one does and never make guesses. But if one is neoclassical mathematician, one is obsessed with making guesses. So the following shows how one might deploy neoclassical lawlessness. A neoclassical economist sees a large number of unemployed people in the cities of developing nations. He wishes to explain it. He notices that most of the unemployed are newcomers from villages. He just presumes that the rural man is lured by the higher wage rate. Voila, he has the idea that at the higher wage rate, not all jobseekers can get the jobs. So he brings seductive sophistry to his story. There is some probability that the man will get a job. He multiplies the wage rate by the probability. He calls it expected wage rate. Now, if the expected urban wage rate is higher than the actual rural wage rate, it seems quite rational to him that the rural jobseeker will keep migrating to the cities until the expected urban wage becomes equal to the rural wage. Why is the urban wage rate higher? He does not spend time to look at data. He just assumes something easy, be it true or false. He assumes that urban workers are rowdy characters. They beat up their employers to give them a wage higher than the equilibrium. He gives it the heavy name of institutional distortion. Distortion sounds great! He almost calls for a jihad against it. Going against a century of revolutionary rhetoric that workers do not get the wages they deserve, he simply assumes that workers get too high wages. Why is this lawless? The neoclassic rushed to where the angels feared to tread. Keynes spent a long time to understand unemployment and started a revolution, but the neoclassic ignored him. He just thought that the price of labor alone is enough to explain why some labor is not sold. He did not care whether employers who did not have the money to pay the workers failed to hire them, even if the workers asked for the correct wage rate. The urban wage seemed too high just because he assumed that the rural wage rate is the normal one. It is the Lilliputian who sees normal man as a distortion. Malthus would have been highly infuriated by such callous carelessness. Malthus witnessed the tragic migration of rural peasants to urban shanties, where the actual and expected urban wage was massively below the rural wage rate. That occurred because the peasants were kicked out of land by the manor lords that enclosed the land. More than 700,000 Rohyngas arrived in Bangladesh where the expected wage rate is zero, as the Myanmar army launched genocide on them. Political migration ought to have been mentioned, and one ought to have carefully distinguished economic migration. The neoclassic forgot that the urban wage rate is higher because the urban worker is more productive. Even if he does not have more education or higher skill, he can earn more in the city because a dense infrastructure and the economies of scale, scope, and nearness make him more productive. He can take advantage of the external capital (the infrastructure) to be more productive. In reality, urban workers are generally more educated and work with higher amount of non-human capital. Indeed, they work longer, and smarter. The neoclassic did not ask whether institutional distortion is necessary to make the urban wage rate higher. He did not consider the case where jobs exist only in the urban areas and not in the rural areas so that there is no meaningful difference in urban and rural wage rate. And the neoclassic did not care that jobseekers eventually get the jobs. Should not he ask about the normal time spent in job search? Why rush to explain urban unemployment? If this is just a temporary event, why bother to explain it? The neoclassical story of distortion of urban wage rate is patently untrue. Then he can go ahead and tell even more lies. He can tell the world that the urban capitalists are under double whack. The workers in the cities beat them up to get wages higher than equilibrium. And the urban borrowers get away with paying interest rates below equilibrium (compared to rural usury), again owing to institutional distortions. The neoclassic of course never explains why the capitalists then do not go to the rural areas and set up their factories there so that they could pay lower wage rates and earn higher interest rates. Why does not he explain all issues? The neoclassic does not because he is a focused scholar, blind of all but one thing. Marshall\u2019s party sees a part only, not the whole. As a neoclassical, he focuses on tiny pieces of the big puzzle. Rural to urban migration is one of many changes that occur in the process of economic development. He does not care to explain all of them at once. So he does not care whether his story of institutional distortion also suits the other pieces of the same big puzzle: urban industrialization, investment in human capital, fertility decline, mortality decline, delayed marriage, longer life expectancy, greater mechanization, deeper monetization, more diversified finance, and so on. Did distortion play a part in migrations from woodlands to grasslands and from there to croplands? In his next rational story, the neoclassic assumes unlimited supply of rural labor to explain urban industrialization. He does not care whether this is at all necessary. Is it really necessary for the rural wage rate at the margin to be zero for urban workers to get a positive wage? He just does not ask so many questions. And then the neoclassic is not ashamed to say that investment in education in countries like India is a waste, because too many graduates fail to get jobs the moment they get their diplomas. Of course it is all false, because the neoclassic makes a prediction that India is educating too many workers who would get no jobs, though those workers eventually create Bangalore and migrate to USA to take up highly paid jobs in the information sector. The neoclassic ought to go to the IMF and World Bank to meet those Indians he said were just waste graduates. The particular white British neoclassical scholar hated Indians, and that is the real story behind his optimization exercise. Another very famous white man served in India as an ambassador of a white nation, and wrote a book on mass poverty to say that Indians are natural fatalists who remain poor because they do not expect to get rich. He said that Indians had no better entertainment than waking up as the trains roared by and having sex to lead to high fertility. Another racist says that rationality arose in northwest Europe, and spread to places where the white rational spread it through exporting their superior culture to the colonies. There is no joy in putting the names of this hall of shame. Next the neoclassic makes up his mind that the rural parents are investors who raise children as capital goods to earn pension in the parent\u2019s old age. Just as some farmers raise poultry so that they can slaughter them for profit, farmers raise kids to get pensions from them. This is absurd, but as one is a neoclassic, this is what he will do. Is pension motive rational? Yes, it seems plausible that parents may wish that their children would grow up to support them in their old age. But being reckless, the neoclassic does not see that parents raise many children in societies where the life expectancy is very low so that the average parent dies long before reaching retirement age and leaves behind a gang of orphaned kids. He cannot explain a nation-wide phenomenon of high fertility by invoking pensions that occur to only exceptionally lucky parents. In contrast, people who on average live long enough to retire and need pension are urban people. They have low fertility. Instead of taking pensions from their children, urban parents typically leave bequests of wealth to them. So what the neoclassic thought was rational was indeed counter factual. Rational and false! As a neoclassical thinker, he disregarded the primeval truth of animal procreation. No animal ever seeks pension from their children. One will never meet the old cow that cannot graze but must survive by drinking her daughter\u2019s milk. Many animal parents risk death in their effort to procreate. Only the most callous disregard of history and animal pathos could let one believe in the monstrosity of parents raising children as pension givers. The mathematics of the neoclassical paradigm is devoid of the most common decency a civilized economist has about the plight of the millions of children abandoned by their fathers who refuse to make child support payments. Is the pension motive present in its full glory for the children whose fathers abandon them? Does he need another hypothesis to explain the fathering of abandoned children? NE was a safe haven for the racists. Those kinds of people could happily make racist assumptions about the behavior of people they did not like. One racist says that African parents are monsters who receive net wealth flow from children, while the Australians are good parents who do not exploit their kids. Or one could do the opposite. He could assume that parents are altruistic. They make sacrifices for the children. And he would imagine that the parent gets utility from the quality of the children. Then he would look into the infinite future. The quality and utility of the child depends on the quality and utility of the grandchild and so on. Hence he would write an intergenerational budget equation with a dynastic utility function. The result will make all angels blush. He will decide that altruistic poor parents borrow money from unborn future progeny so that they can spend on the children\u2019s education to prove how much they love the kids. What a nice stratagem: borrow money from the great great great grandson (not yet born) to educate self so that the lender can have an educated great great great grandpa. In his model, the neoclassic does not see that the parental altruism prevents the birth of many children so that a few favored ones can get larger budgets while the aborted others are denied lives at all. And he makes altruism stand on borrowing from the beneficiary of his altruism. The neoclassic has rationality. So he can easily borrow from people not yet born. For this grand piece of wisdom, he can win a Nobel Prize. One gets encouragement to make such assumptions. One can get Nobel Prizes for making this kind of assumption, such as for proving that social choice is not possible, or saying that prophecies are self-fulfilling. So the root of indiscipline is the meaningless term of rationality. One can ascribe any plausible motive to the rational man. Had rationality been a reality, one would be able to detect its presence and measure it, to say something like Friedman had 87.46% rationality while Lucas had 09.39% of it. But the neoclassic uses the term as a circular definition: a rational man is one who has rationality, and rationality is what a rational man has. Rationality is a meaning, not a fact. The rational is an adjective, not a noun. Rationality is an idea inside the head without any objective reality outside the head. To bring discipline, one should not ascribe any particular motive at all. One should do no more than ascribe a general motive for doing anything. No matter whether one buys or sells, invests or disinvests, his motive is always the same. The motive is to make a gain. It is entrepreneurial. For example, no matter which individual buys it, and buys whatever kind and quantity of something, the motive is always the same for everyone: reduce the cost of procurement through purchase compared to the cost of production. This motive is universal, is necessary, and is sufficient to lead to purchase of anything at any time in any place by anybody. By the law of identity, every instance of purchase is identical in the intention of the buyer. This motive is super-rational. The neoclassical thinkers do not take objective functions seriously. To explain different actions of the same person, they assume different intentions and constraints. They want to produce a result by making suitable assumptions about preferences and constraints. No honest scientist can do that. If they were disciplined, they would make no assumptions about behavior. Behaviour must be observed, and never assumed. Economics should not study human behavior. It should study the behavior of economic objects, namely, actually or potentially traded goods. This would explain why the quantities and kinds of goods happen to be what they are. Even if psychologists could explain human behavior, the economist would have no use for it. Consistent economics uses the general motive as a meaning, and not as a fact. The general entrepreneurial motive of making a gain does not explain the price or the quantity or the income or the expenditure. It merely interprets the action. The explanation is furnished by the institutional rules of exchange, whose presence is objectively established. Indiscipline is inevitable if one wants to start from a state of mind. There is nothing to say what an agent might intend or expect or perceive. One is left with no guidance other than to make arbitrary assumptions. But if one tries to explain the behavior of economic objects, one has a clear issue such as why prices change or incomes change? To explain the change in one good, he links it to other goods and not to eccentric behavior of odd individuals. He never peeks into the state of the mind. Thus if he wants to explain the increase in food grain output, he should look at the changes in the factors of production: cultivation techniques, fertilizer use, irrigation, prices, costs, finances, and so on. He will never need a utility function for this purpose. One does not need a green mind for green revolution in crop production. Teleology means that human goals provide the basic explanation. The trick is to generalize the goal and never to specify it. It is easy. The goal of the economic agent is to make pure gains. No matter what the utility function may be, this generalized goal is good enough to explain the universals of the economy. To put it even more simply, one cannot get general theories with specific goals. So, one should not specify goals. Otherwise, the fate of the neoclassical is to spin endless specifications that are inherently unsuitable to give general theories. And theories that are not general are not really theories. These are no better than wild guesses. Particulars are histories, not theories. In the end, neoclassical methodology is fake: it merely pretends to seek knowledge. The two major sources of neoclassical indiscipline are the absurd method of partial equilibrium and the fallacy of gambler\u2019s probability. Partial equilibrium is impossible. Ceteris paribus is a deadly sabotage of science. First, if something is truly constant, one may never mention it. It affects nothing. Secondly, if it is not constant, it is a sin to assume it to be so. If there is an exchange between x and y, then one either learns all or none of the following: the buyer demands the quantity and the seller supplies the quantity of x only if demand is equal to supply of x. The same goes for y as the payment of x. The demand for y must be equal to the supply of y. Lastly, the value of x must be equal to the value of y so that there is a definite price of x, given as y/x per unit of x. At the same time, one must also learn that the income of the seller of x is exactly equal to the expenditure of the buyer of x. There are no ifs and buts. One either understands all or none. General equilibrium means that one writes down all conditions that must be fulfilled at once for something to happen. Partial equilibrium means that one omits many conditions. This is surely unacceptable. Half the truth is by definition false. One must tell the whole truth. A famous neoclassical author killed the spirit of science in the following manner. Take a time series of income and draw a least-square regression line. The level of income on the regression line is permanent income. Actual observed incomes are either higher or lower. As a scientist, his precise job is to explain why in some years the income is below average rather than above average. But he chose to call it statistical error. The constant (permanent income) has no use in theory: one never needs to explain a constant. The job is to explain variation. If he is neoclassical, he does not explain the variation. He dismisses it as error. In the same spirit, the famous professor said that correct conclusions could come from false premises. This is an absurd manner of presenting paradoxes. When Copernicus says that the earth spins on its axis, ignorant people think that he is making a false premise. They do not understand that they all suffer from illusion. They misperceive the earth to stay still. No, a correct conclusion can never come from a false premise. It is of course almost always the case the scientist makes statement of the obvious that fools find to be false. For example, ignorant people do not have the information that more than 92% of the hungry people of the earth are food producers. So it seems false to them from uninformed intuition. Intuition always gives superstition and never gives science. Science must distil the universal by falsifying the accidental particulars. The test of falsification is to show that accidental elements are false causes. The test asks: can the event occur without this particular element? Statistical inference cannot help make a decision. Thus if every drop of ocean water contains salt, statistics will be unable to falsify salt as an ingredient of water. Even accidents may be universal, and yet they remain accidents. One must forget statistical inference. He must go to the lab. He must carefully remove salt from water to falsify salt as a part of water. Neoclassical economics is just a fake pretence of science, without any commitment to any principle of science. However, one needs to shed a few tears for honest people caught in the traps of deceit. There are great many people who work hard to look at realities, gather data with painful hard work, and then try to make sense of them. They work on applied issues of economic development and demography, on matters of health and education, transportation, agriculture, industry, labour, capital, housing, and so on. It is not their fault that they have no science to apply. They want to understand and solve the real life problem of poverty, unemployment, inflation, inequality, discrimination and so on, but without any valid guidance from their fun-loving teachers wearing the bright and shiny crowns of scientific theory. They may all feel a sense of betrayal by the likes of Marshall, Pareto, Arrow, Solow, Lucas and so on. 5.4\tNeoclassical rhetoric: deception A sophist is a deceitful person who plays games with words to stretch and twist and reverse meanings to confuse the audience, stupefy them, and manipulate their emotions to make them believe in falsehoods. He is always hiding the facts. A neoclassical sophist dupes the audience with mathematical symbols that have no reference to reality and manipulate them to pretend that something is happening. A statistical sophist makes people thoroughly stupid by proposing that just because a die has 6 faces and 1 of them must turn up on the top, therefore the ratio 1/6 means that it is the probability. He dishonestly argues that a minimum sum of squares means something has happened to regress to a line it is supposed to have traversed except for random errors. There is no honesty in adding the squares of positive errors with those of negative errors. There is no reality that occurs according to least square regression. Instead of presenting the plain facts, the sophist presents imaginary concoctions such as t-statistic, F-statistic, unit root, and what not. The statistical sophist manufactures numbers to distort and misinterpret facts. Probability theory was designed to cheat the mental morons going to the casinos to be cheated. Mere criticism serves no real purpose of regime change. One must offer a superior alternative to dethrone the pretenders. The rebellion of the desperate students against the unrealism of what they saw as a self-absorbed narcissist and the launch of a journal named Real World Economic Review will not be enough. A complete alternative to neoclassical economics is required. Hopefully, consistent economics can meet that requirement. A secure grasp of the law of exchange would help the future generations not just interpret the world, but also to change it. 6.\tConcluding commentary: Classical and consistent economics adopt the same basic ontology, methodology, and rhetoric. They differ crucially in epistemology. The task ahead for a modern economist is to seriously take up the issue of the choice between natural law and institutional law. These laws cannot be chosen on empirical grounds. The epistemology gives one the eye to see the world: it is not the world being seen. The pragmatic issue is whether institutional law offers a simpler and more complete explanation than natural law does. Which eye offers a clearer and more vivid picture is the crucial issue. Consistency analysis may have done to economics something akin to what Copernicus did to astronomy. Capturing all economics in the embrace of one single unifying equation may have helped rescue economic science. The application of consistent economics produces dramatically different policy agenda and options. The matter of reciprocal claims and obligations occupies the center of policy discourse. The use of money and credit to manage claims and obligations appear as the principal tools to tackle economic problems of real people. But that is all in the future. The first task is to fix the science. Bibliography Arrow, K.J. (1950). \"A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare.\" Journal of Political Economy, 58 (4): 328\u2013346 Arrow, K.

            "answer_text": "Quite a bit. Firstly, the objective is still the same - to try to discern the objective laws and principles that govern then actions of the observable universe. The problem is with how the science can be conducted. A fundamental principle of science rigor is to be able to test a theory as to how well it describes and predicts observations. There is also the principle of \u201cfalsifiability\u201d which relates to this - you must be able to prove a theory false. The means to do this is experimentation. To do this requires a control subject in which no changes are made and the test subject in which a single change is made. The resulting observations are compared and any differences must then be attributable to that change made. At a very fundamental level, there is no way perform such experiments. There is no duplicate earth in which we can change one thing and compare observations. And even in cases where such attempts are made, there is generally no way to eliminate other changes and differences than the one that one is testing. There will be a number of of differing parameters. Now, attempts can be made and are made to try to \u201cnull out\u201d the other changing parameters. But this is far from perfect. So while the objective is the same, the means and ability to apply scientifically rigorous methodologies is essentially impossible. So researches have to do the best they can with the means and resources available. ",
