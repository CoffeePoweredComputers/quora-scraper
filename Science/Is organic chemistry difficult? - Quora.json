            "answer_text": "Organic chemistry is the most dreaded of all science classes. It has the highest failure rate, lowest class average, and more retakes than any other science course.Yet most schools weigh organic chemistry about the same as general chemistry or physics.  Visit here for more information: https://9219603113.com/reshenie-zadach-po-himii/ Let\u2019s compare the other standard \u201cHARD\u201d classes Biology can be mastered by continuous reading, review, and memorization. You may need help understanding the concepts, but once you get it, you\u2019ve got it for good!General chemistry and physics are all about grasping a concept, learning how to apply a formula, and then manipulating the formula in just the right way so that the numbers fall into place and your answer easily emerges. They contain a TON of math and many formulas to memorize and apply, but once you get it, you\u2019ve got it!So why is organic chemistry so much more difficult? I do have my suspicions, but let me interject by telling you that organic chemistry was actually one of my favorite courses in college. After I completed organic chemistry as a biology degree requirement, I chose to double major in chemistry as well! And that is because I realized this: Organic Chemistry IS Different! You certainly have vocabulary words to memorize and you may even be given 3-5 math equations to memorize, but that is it! The rest of organic chemistry is just ONE GIANT PUZZLE. This course doesn\u2019t expect you to memorize and spit back information. In fact, if that is your approach you are probably destined for failure. This course doesn\u2019t have a set of \u2018steps\u2019 you can use to answer a question and be done with it. Instead, organic chemistry asks you to do something your other classes probably don\u2019t. Organic Chemistry requires you to THINK! As silly as it sounds, too many students are simply not used to this method. They expect to find a formula, work it out, and be done. Organic chemistry is all about the mechanisms, the how and why of reactions, and perhaps even the interpretation of a mysterious graph or two. That is why organic chemistry is just so darn difficult! How can you use this information to your advantage? If the course is different, then your approach must be different too. You have to approach your studies with the desire to understand what is happening and why.Toss the idea of memorization right out the window and get ready to:UNDERSTAND, THINK, and APPLY. Constantly ask yourself WHY each electron attacks the way it does.Why a double bond is attracted to a particular electrophile.Be able to understand, intuitively, which atom or molecule is more reactive.Why a particular functional group will show up on a graph one way or another. Hopefully, I\u2019ve shocked you into rethinking your entire organic chemistry approach, but I don\u2019t want to alarm you without offering any support. ",

            "answer_text": "Well this is really a difficult question to answer but the answer will look like the answer to \u2018Is [fill in the blank] difficult and also depends on your definition of difficult. I can tell you what will help to make it less difficult. Are you a chemistry person? If not, it will be harder because you may not relate to the content. If you are a chemistry person are you more theory driven, are you the precise type - if so, organic will may be more difficult. As chemistry goes, organic tends to be less precise and the theory less formal which may drive physical chemistry or theoretical types crazy. I have heard it said that organic chemists are the witches (warlocks) of chemistry. BTW, I am and organic chemist. The is a certain amount of memorization required. Face facts, you have to memorize a certain amount of information in any discipline. As example, math. you have to learn your \u2018times-tables\u2019 and there just is no getting around it. Unfortunately, you will have at least one semester of this, memorizing. After that, the \u2018story\u2019 of organic chemistry will begin to reveal itself, assuming you are interested in the story. At this point, learning mechanisms will greatly support your effort to learn organic (or, at least get through it). So, you will see that there is not really that much to memorize rather a huge amount of organic chemistry can be neatly fit into a few basic mechanisms and you will become good at predicting the outcome of reactions. Stay with it long enough and you will start making up your own reactions. Good luck and just try to enjoy the ride. ",
