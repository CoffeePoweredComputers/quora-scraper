            "answer_text": "I don't think there is a specific rating system. From personal experience however I found the following. My school used the Oxford books for the sciences and both the students and the teachers disliked them. First of all it didn't have all the information from the syllabus and secondly it had some severe mistakes in it. However, what I liked about it was that it wass nicely sectioned following the subsections of the syllabus. I preferred the Pearson books because they explained the concepts very well and gave a lot of information. However the books give more information than needed and this might be annoying to students that only want to know what is absolutely necessary. For math I can't compare books because we only used Oxford books and really liked them. It explained the concepts very well and the chapters were nicely arranged in a logical order. Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "Personally, I prefer the Pearson Baccalaureate books for both the sciences and mathematics. The authors of the Pearson science books have published newer editions reflecting the changes to the IB science syllabi this year. I studied the Chemistry HL and the Physics SL books. They contain material that is very in-depth and written in unambiguous language. There are plenty of exercises that are appropriate for the level and give you enough practice for the exams. I studied the 2012 edition of the Pearson Mathematics HL book and it sufficiently covered all the course material, and more. I\u2019m sure that there is a newer edition on the market that would be more suitable, considering the IB mathematics syllabus was changed in 2014. The Pearson books also come with codes that you can enter at their website to have access to extra material online. They contain all chapters as PDF files (along with worked solutions to exercises) and also provide information on the Internal Assessment and Extended Essay. ",
