            "answer_text": "Because the Higgs field allowed subatomic particles to have mass. That\u2019s the simple explanation and everything follows from that. The attraction of the subatomic particles to form the first atoms, the attraction of those atoms, the \u201cprimordial hydrogen\u201d, the formation of the first stars, the formation of the more complex elements within those stars, etc, etc. All pretty well understood. Now\u2026 to go back in time before the \u201cBig Bang\u201d that released that vast amount of pure energy \u2026. We are on shaky ground. There are a number of hypotheses. The \u201cwhy\u201d of all this assumes two entirely different questions. To a physicist, the \u201cwhy\u201d would be\u2026 \u201cwhat are the processes that caused the initial phases of the universe to come into being.\u201d The physicist would not be looking for \u201cpurpose\u201d, only explanation. To someone of a philosophical, metaphysical, or religious bent\u2026. Then the \u201cwhy?\u201d Would assume purpose, plan, or design. You may plumb the depths of those disciplines if you wish, and perhaps find something you find resonant. But to me, I\u2019ll simply quote Monsiuer La Place\u2026. \u201cI have no need of that hypothesis.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "What led you to the conclusion that there should be nothing? People often ask how the universe came into existence or how something can come from nothing. I think these questions are inherently flawed as they assume the following: 1. The universe had a beginning 2. That \u201cnothingness\u201d exists First of all, some models suggest the universe may have never had a \u201cbeginning\u201d. Yes, the Big Bang happened; however, the Big Bang says nothing about a  or a \u201cbeginning\u201d. The Big Bang is simply a model of the very dense, hot state of the early universe as it was undergoing expansion starting from  (extrapolating further back would require a theory of quantum gravity). Secondly, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s such thing as nothingness. Even true vacuums contain spacetime. A true state of nothingness would be the absence of spacetime. That might not even be possible. When we try to picture nothingness, we often picture a black void...But that\u2019s still something! I think the notion of nothingness is simply a meaningless construct that might have originated from humans attempting to contemplate the cessation of consciousness. You could argue that an empty set { } contains nothing; however, that\u2019s mathematics, and mathematics doesn\u2019t always translate to reality. So it\u2019s possible that there is no such thing as nothingness. Of course, I could be wrong. ",
