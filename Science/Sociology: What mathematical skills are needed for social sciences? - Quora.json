            "answer_text": "The answer to your question is very much dependent on the type of social science you intend on going into (Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology etc) but most importantly the type of research methodology adopted within the discipline (Quantitive vs. Qualitative).  Psychology for example is very much aligned with scientific approaches including statistics and correlations of variables. However this is not to say sociology does not. There are different schools of thought, some that use more positivist methods (scientific) and others which are more interpretative and/or critically based (subjective). One highly mathematical area of course is economics, which involves considerably more knowledge of math.  In terms of mathematical skills required you are better placed in terms of conducting research, having an understanding of statistics, charts, algebraic expression and correlations than any other. But keep in mind SPSS is a software that is used by many social scientist to help with this.  Mathematics i would say, is an addition to the social scientist but it is not wholly required as a primary focus. It is however a necessity to be good at analysis, research, critical thinking and excellent writing before the math skills  are even considered. ",

            "answer_text": "If you plan on majoring in a social science like sociology or psychology--plan on going to school till you get your doctorate to teach or do research-if a psych major you at least could counsel and work in various settings. As far as sociology--the same, but your learned skills will not get you a job using much of your field. As both need post graduate courses, you will have to take the registered course and not self study--they want empiric proff that you had this training. For your field, probability and statistics would be most important for both designing and reading other's research, and to understand good vs flawed research. If you teach--you will be writing research, and possibly designing research projects with your students. Again, I would ask the counsel of your school guidance or sociology teacher-they will help to guide you. Please don't think you can self study on subjects. You miss the wonderful exchanges of ideas and dialogue with your teachers and fellow students which will open up new possibilities for your mind, and life path.  Good Luck! ",
