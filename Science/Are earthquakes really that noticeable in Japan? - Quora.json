            "answer_text": "I lived in Japan for a total of 6 months, so probably not a very good source compared to others here. That said, one day in Fall last year I was having lunch and chatting with my friends when our phones shocked me in mid sentence. All the phones in the room suddenly buzzed and simultaneously screeched \u201cJISHIN!!! JISHIN!!! JISHIN!!! JISHIN!!!!!\u201d (Earthquake!!) and I froze in shock. My first thoughts were \u201cWhoa my phone is doing some cool Japanese shit\u201d and then \u201cWhat did it mean anyway..?\u201d (This is very early in my stay in Japan) and then I guessed\u2026 \u201cshit\u2026 earthquake\u2026???\u201d Soon after the earthquake came. The ground rocked, my friends held onto furnitures for balance, and I held onto my friend *cough* who has a very sweet smile *cough*. It lasted for maybe half a minute. Afterwards, it became a nice topic for gossip of the day. Afterwaves still came throughout the day and that made me jittery about spilling all my reagents- my lab is on a high floor so it swayed quite a lot. All in all, it was quite an experience. The earthquake is magnitude 6 in Tottori, on the Sea of Japan coast of Honshu, so not that close to where I was in Northern Osaka. Probably what I felt there was around magnitude 4-ish. I actually felt more earthquakes all the rest of my stay, but none are really significant. Once while staying in a high rise in Tokyo I feel the ground swaying mildly, but that\u2019s it. A couple times I got woken up in my dorm in Osaka by a \u201cswaying ground\u201d sensation, but it could be just dreams or sensory clumsiness, except that all those Canmake lipglosses I\u2019ve so lovingly arranged on my fridge had mysteriously toppled over. (I\u2019ve had a worse earthquake than what I felt in Japan- in Bogor, Indonesia, in around 2011. It was so hard it wasn\u2019t like swaying at all, I thought the sky was falling down. But it lasted for just 4\u20135 seconds so I thought it was just me at first (It\u2019s not.) Yes, I come from another Earthquake Heaven, Indonesia!! Evil laugh. But as it happens, it is a pretty big country and my region VERY rarely gets earthquakes at all, so I\u2019m still unexperienced.) ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on where you are. Some areas of Japan get very few earthquakes. My husband\u2019s birthplace, Saga Prefecture, in Kyushu, is known to rarely experience detectable earthquakes. However, in some areas very small earthquakes occur daily, although most of them are so small that you wouldn\u2019t be able to feel anything. Below you can see that if you live on the eastern side of Japan you are much more likely to experience earthquakes.  Where I live in Saitama, just to the north of Tokyo I\u2019d say we feel a quake every few months or so - sometimes more often, sometimes quite a bit more time passes between ones we can feel. Most of the time it\u2019s very insignificant - just enough to pause and say, \u201chey, is that an earthquake\u2026 yep, the hanging lamp is gently swaying.\u201d Other times it\u2019s just enough of a jolt to wake me if I\u2019m sleeping, get the dog barking, and send the kids running to the front door to prop it open (which we do to make sure we can get out if it turns out to be big enough to damage the door frame). As an aside, sometimes the quake moves up and down, and starts with a jolt. Sometimes it\u2019s a back-and-forth type where things really sway - that type can make me feel quite dizzy. Edited to add: I forgot to mention length. Most of the time the smaller ones can be felt for 30 seconds to a minute, I\u2019d say. Larger ones may go on for a few minutes, and gradually taper off. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell when it\u2019s really finished, because you feel like you\u2019re still swaying for a bit afterwards. The scariest one in my 22 years living here was the 3/11 Tohoku Earthquake in 2011. We were outside on the playground of an international school on the edge of Tokyo/Saitama. I was gabbing with other moms when the ground under us suddenly jolted with enough force to set us off balance and need to reach out hands to steady one another. The kids all screamed and ran toward us. We held on to each other as the ground shook and we watched the electric lines jiggle and the branches of the trees shake. The next minute all of the kids that were inside the school came streaming out screaming as they ran. When we got home a couple of hours later some things, like photo frames, had fallen over. Nothing was broken. Our home is pretty earthquake safe, I\u2019d say. However, we owned a cabin by the ocean in Miyagi Prefecture, around 90km north of the epicenter. We watched the news in horror as the tsunami washed away many familiar and beloved places. Not an easy thing to forget! ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is definite yes. It first starts with a tiny rumble of the floor with the slight shuttering sounds of small items in the room. Then you stop what you are doing and listen to the sounds. Then the rumble becomes more noticeable. The sounds become larger, too. Then the whole room trembles and clothes hanging from a rack will swing. Now you know that a big earthquake has hit you. Next thing you will do is to wonder if the earthquake will stop or continue. This is when you go to the entrance and open the door because if the room collapses, the closed door will trap you inside the room. Most earthquakes will stop at this stage. In 2011, when Japan was hit by a major earthquake, my office building trembled. Some items from the bookshelves fell. I went to the entrance to keep the door open. The tremors would not stop. The business guest in the office was unable to go home that day because all train services were affected. He stayed in the office the night. I offered some wine and we drank it the night. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, quakes are very noticeable, especially those above shindo 3, but they are relatively rare: once per six months or so. When it comes to suffering, it is mostly an inconvenience rather than any serious loss, because buildings are quake-resistant. That said, basic precautions like fixing your furniture to the walls, never placing anything breakable onto a high place and so on are still in power. Some quakes are large enough to topple something down, such as flower vases. The 2011 one was very strong and scary, with many things broken inside the homes. However, unless you were caught in tsunami, or inside an old building, such as Kudan Kaikan where the ceiling collapsed, the danger was not very high. It is also worth nothing that not all cities in Japan are equally quake-prone. Tokyo is on the dangerous end with earthquakes coming several times a year, while Osakans rarely feel any earthquake in many years at all. ",

Everyone tells me that Okazaki bedrock is very strong and stable. So, in this area, quakes are barely noticeable. They are rare enough that even minor ones become topics for conversation. (Of note, this area\u2014the Tokai area\u2014 is overdue for a major quake that is expected to cause a lot of deaths and, by some estimates, cripple Japan if and when it does hit. Happy thoughts!) ",

We live on a solid hill in a modern building with good earthquake proofing, though. Downtown, glass had shattered and fallen from skyscrapers, and could have killed somebody. A friend\u2019s house was badly damaged. When I went to my office, which is on a higher floor in a less-solid part of town, the bookshelves had fallen and there was quite a mess to clean up. Almost a year ago, there were some bad quakes to the south of us in Kumamoto. I was walking my dog and my phone started screaming \u201cJishin desu! Jishin desu!\u201d All Japanese smartphones are required to have built-in earthquake warning systems that can give people a few seconds to get under a table or something. I heard phones going off all over the neighborhood and then everything started shaking. We were pretty far from the quake, but it was quite serious and we definitely felt it. Over 100 people died down around Kumamoto, and many are still homeless. One of the most beautiful buildings on the island, Kumamoto Castle, was badly damaged. We definitely noticed the series of quakes that lasted for days, hitting again and again. I had backpacks ready for me and my wife to go to safety if our city were to be hit hard. Fortunately it wasn\u2019t necessary. Just two days ago we had a very small quake here. I almost didn\u2019t notice it. ",

Walking on ground level you might see power lines sway, signs shake or birds take flight. Or nothing at all. On the 22nd floor of a modern skyscraper, where I work, it\u2019s more obvious. The newer buildings are designed to sway (and creak like an old pirate ship), so the impact is exaggerated. I\u2019d say there is one every few months that makes you sit up and wonder if it\u2019s The Big One. Here\u2019s a handy site (in Japanese, but interactive) that shows quake frequency in Tokyo metropolitan area: \u5730\u9707\u3092\u77e5\u308b\u7d71\u8a08\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8\u3010\u63fa\u308c\u308b\u65e5\u672c\u5217\u5cf6\u3011 ",

All my breakable goods like glass and porcelain was ok. That is the most negative personal impact I ever experienced from earthquakes. If you happen to be on the beach while a mega quake hits you just off the coast then you may be screwed, but all in all, it takes tremendous bad luck to be caught up in something like that. ",

            "answer_text": "I actually think it really depends on the kind of person you are. Let me tell you my experiences living here in Japan for 6 months: I was here when one of the strongest earthquakes since 2011 happened in November 2016, and still I did not feel it. Almost everyone in my university was woken up by the first quake at around 6:00 AM, but I just slept on. I am a very heavy sleeper and normally nothing wakes me up that fast. But I also did not notice some smaller earthquakes that were felt mutually by fellow students. Out of about 6 earthquakes that happened in the last 6 months since I\u2019ve lived here, I have only felt one. And I only think I felt it because I was focusing on something in that very moment, which made it very easy to feel how suddenly everything started to shake in my room on the 4th floor. So, to answer your question: Most, but not all, people feel the earthquakes that happen from time to time. But nobody \u201csuffers\u201d from them and normally they are so weak that people do not even interrupt what they are doing. ",

Where are you when the earthquake strikes, the severity of the quake\u2026 Small quakes you barely feel, larger ones may just be a little bit of shaking, the building slightly swaying, a rumbling noise\u2026 Then there was 3/11 and the big shake. The first intimation of something bad was a small little shake, then a rumbling that was just on the verge of being audible. Then the rabbit\u2019s (my pet Haru) ears went stiff, she jumped up in panic, looked left, looked right! I grabbed her just as the rumble became a sound like a runaway train and grabbed on to the door frame as the apartment floor visibly rolled. ",

Usually there are small earthquakes that you can feel but not really life threatening since almost all buildings are designed with earthquakes in mind. There are big earthquakes that happen sometimes and those can get rough. Back in 2018 there was a magnitude 6\u20137ish earthquake that happened near Osaka, it wasn\u2019t too bad and you just have to tell yourself to stay calm. ",

In Hiroshima, where I live, you almost have no earthquakes because there are no fault lines running through it. When you do feel one it seems distant and \u201cgentle\u201d. Live in Tokyo and go up buildings, you will feel it greater even if it is a minor shock. A friend said the Fukushima earthquake six years felt incredibly strong from the 60+ floor building she was working in in Tokyo, even though it was a 4 on the Japanese scale (meaning nothing fell over from the shock). Closer to ground level and the affects are greatly decreased. ",
