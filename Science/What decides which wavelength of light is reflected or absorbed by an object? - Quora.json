Ideally the old familiar concepts need to be re-thought. \u2018Colour\u2019 is just a response to wavelength between our eye and brain Electrons should mainly be thought of as \u2018absorbing and re-emitting\u2019 the oscillations we call \u2018light\u2019. Now perhaps think of an octave in music; 8 \u2018notes\u2019. some parts of the arriving light will \u2018harmonise\u2019, and some be discordant. It may also be thought of as additive (constructive) or destructive wave interference. Subject to the atomic structure, different wavelengths will \u2018couple\u2019 to different degrees with different media, and be re-emitted (or \u2018scattered\u2019). The rest is retained and manifests as \u2018heat\u2019 energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Two types actions of electrons are responsible for absorption and reflection of light. Sunlight contains full spectrum of visible light (all the colours). Absorption of light by free electrons: When free electrons absorbs light its KE increases and it gets accelerated, accelerating charge (electron in this case) emits the absorbed photon as light ray. Sometimes if the electron bump into atom, in this process it gives its KE to atom and increases its vibration (means converted as heat). Absorption of light by bounded electrons: In this case the electron absorbs energy from light and moves to higher orbit around the nucleus. This excited electron can\u2019t stay long in the new orbit and falls back to original level. In this process it transmits back the energy it absorbed in the form of light. Depending on the characteristics of the material electrons convert some frequency of light into heat and others it transmits back as reflected light ray. That\u2019s why we see different materials shine in different colors. White colour material reflects all the colours of light and keeps itself cool(cotton). Black colour material absorbs all the colours of light and keeps itself hot (coal). This is the brief description of light and material interaction. ",
