            "answer_text": "People have little appreciation of how incredible it already is that any creature lives as long as it does. Stick most non-living items of any complexity out in the elements and they will decay fairly quickly, given a few rains, and some beating sunlight.  Our life spans are an active, not a passive process. In \"The Great Mambo Chicken and the Trans-human Condition\" by Ed Regis, (excellent read, by the way, to anyone interested in longevity) the story goes that Nasa did an experiment with chickens to see how they would react to an increased gravity. They put chickens an a higher artificial gravity (centrifugal force) and the chickens came out healthy and very strong. The experimenters weren't directly interested in longevity, so this doesn't directly answer your question, but it gives me a good segue. Muscle is interesting because, unlike most cells, it has more than one nucleus per cell. Here's something to think about. Muscle represents about 40% of the typical man's body mass. Yet when's the last time you heard of someone getting muscle cancer. If it was a pure mass issue, you'd expect 40% of the cancers in men to start as muscle cancers. What's my point? My point is that some interesting things happen to muscles under stress, verses under weakness. These are systemic things that cause the body to produce it's own systemic effects. I have read (alas, don't remember the source) that the number one predictor of disease was a loss of strength. The reason people might believe that having less stress would reduce damage is because the general nature of inanimate objects is that more oxidative damage automatically builds up. But this isn't necessarily the case in animate objects. Much of the \"free radical theory of aging\" has not held up to scrutiny over time. There is very likely an optimal stress level. But I think the jury is out on whether that optimal level is higher than what we have naturally, lower than what we have naturally, or exactly what we have naturally. In any event, there's not a good low gravity environment that doesn't also have higher radiation. So for practical purposes it is currently difficult to even run an experiment that can tell you. If I had to guess, my guess would be that a higher gravity environment would turn out to be better, rather than worse for longevity. ",

            "answer_text": "Based on this logic, wouldn't it make sense to ask if you would live longer if you constantly lived in the water? Wait, you mean the human body isn't built to be sea dwelling so of course that wouldn't work? Same rules apply to lower gravity. The human body can adapt to a variety of conditions, but forcing to adapt to conditions far removed from what it evolved in is not necessarily the key to longevity. ",

            "answer_text": "I would think that creatures living in the sea may get their longevity from the lack of solar radiation rather than the lack of gravity.   Gravity underwater is for all intents and purposes the same as above ground when pulling on each cell in an organism.   I think gravity is more difficult for humans since we constantly have to balance ourselves, vs a creature that floats or craws. My vote is that gravity has no real affect on longevity. ",
