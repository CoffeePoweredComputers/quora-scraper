            "answer_text": "This is some of information about plant cell and animal cell: So animal cells can have various shapes, but plant cells only havethe shapes of their cell walls. That's nice for plants, because it gives them the ability to grow up and out, where they can get lots of sunlight for making their food. In particular, organelles called chloroplasts allow plants to capture the energy of the Sun in energy-rich molecules; cell walls allow plants tohave rigid structures as varied as wood trunks and supple leaves; and vacuoles allow plant cells to change sizExactly why plant cell have wall and animal cell don't :-Cell walls are supporting structures that help the plant to have a fixed shape and protect it from injury. Other than that, it helps to keep the plant turgid so that it can stay firm and upright. Because when it enters a high water potential solution, as water moves in, the water exerts turgor pressure on the cell wall and the cell wall thus exerts an opposing pressure to keep water out. Hence cell wall is needed for the plant. On the other hand, animal cells do not need to keep the structures, as they have the skeletal system to protect the organs and cushion them against any external Injuries.  This was the all information I had thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Cytoplasm has concentrated solutes that draw water from the environment. As a result, cell membranes are susceptible to osmotic rupture. Many cells have evolved a cell wall to add strength. However, with a cell wall, it becomes less convenient to pass large food particles across the cell membrane (phagocytosis). If the cell is autotrophic then phagocytosis is less necessary. In addition, the mass added due to the cell wall, makes motility much more expensive and therefore less beneficial. Many cells have forgone the cell wall for the benefit of phagocytosis, rendering themselves vulnerable to osmotic rupture. As a result, they must pump out incoming water at an energy cost (contractile vacuole). However, heterotrophy provides much more energy than does autotrophy, absorbing the cost of pumping water. Heterotrophs, therefore, requiring high energy, increase their ability to encounter food particles by being motile. Motility requires more energy, but without a heavy cell wall, it is far more cost effective. Hence, heterotrophs are more likely to be motile foregoing a cell wall , and autotrophs more likely to be sessile retaining a cell wall As multicellularity evolved, these circumstances were inherited by plants and animals each as they are autotrophic and heterotrophic respectively. Answer derived from William Halmeck's answer to Why does the Earth lack a mobile form of autotrophs? ",
