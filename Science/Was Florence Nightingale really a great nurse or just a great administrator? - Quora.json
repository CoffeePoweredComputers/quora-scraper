            "answer_text": "OK, so I always thought Flo was an historical nursing figure who had no bearing on modern nursing. However, Florence Nightingale is a nursing icon that one of my mentors looked up to. Why? Flo's \"Notes on Nursing,\" written in 1859 holds the answers. Flo figured out that changing wound dressings regularly would prevent or decrease infection- really? Maintaining a clean environment- clean sheets, daily patient baths, care givers washing their hands would prevent or decrease infection- duh! She deduced that other patients could catch contagious diseases, so she separated them- makes sense. \" Nightingale believed that, by keeping patients well-fed, warm, comfortable, and above all clean, nursing could solve many problems that 19th century medicine could not.\" Further, Flo felt that nurses should develop managerial skills and keep detailed notes about their patients, their injuries, treatments and response to treatment. Further, Flo was quite an activist on matters of patient care and as the result she was considered a pain by the British Office of Public Health. She tirelessly described her experiences, observation and conclusions and she offered her notes as a reference. Public health officials recognized her wisdom after a while and they implemented many changes she advocated for. All of these things are core components of modern nursing more than 160 years later. So now I say that Florence Nightingale was both a brilliant nurse and an effective administrator. We could use her now. ",

This doesn't sound like much, but she saved countless lives by preventing infection. She was a great administrator because she recruited countless women to become nurses, knew how to staff a hospital and pretty much invented triage. ",
