            "answer_text": "Many have answered it but i will answer it anyways. If we look at the standard physics model, we can see quarks are one of them. These particles are responsible for creation of protons and neutrons. These quarks have a special property, which is they follow the energy-to-mass proportion and hence can be created out of pure energy. When the universe first cooled, the energy started having wells which collapsed into quarks. At some areas the collapse was different or was at a different speed, creating electron. The quarks came together and formed protons and protons are of attracted to electrons. they formed hydrogen. The question many asked was why isn\u2019t there too much deuterium there then? It\u2019s simple The weak forces convert Protons into neutrons. At that point it wasn\u2019t existent. It existed as electro-weak force. Even if it caused the proton to turn into a neutron, remember, the neutron would be on it\u2019s own, a free neutron. Not a particle to exchange it\u2019s Pi-Mesons and everybody knows that Half life of a neutron is less than in-fact 15 minutes. Even if during that 15 minutes you may ask that a proton could have hanged onto the neutron, but remember that the temperature of the universe was cooling from infinitely high temperature, so it was impossible for a proton and neutron to hang on to each other. The extremely high temperature would separate them apart. The universe took some more time to cool down, but by then hydrogen began fusing into helium.I\u2019m not saying that there was no deuterium. There could have been. Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle allows it. We knew temperatures were high so we could accurate their momentum up so it doesn\u2019t allows us to know where exactly it is. But compared the the amount of Hydrogen present at that time, The deuterium\u2019s amount was nothing. ",

            "answer_text": "Because it is the simplest form. When the universe originally formed, it was too hot for matter as we know it to exist - there was only energy, quarks, and possibly other particles we have never encountered. As the universe cooled, the quarks began to stick together. And when they did, they formed protons, the simplest form of matter. Which, when combined with an electron, makes hydrogen. While it was still hot, some of that hydrogen fused to helium, but most of it remained as hydrogen. ",
