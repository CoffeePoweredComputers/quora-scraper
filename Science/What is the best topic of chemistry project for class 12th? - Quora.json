            "answer_text": "If you are really interested in chemistry, you must known that these days petroleum market are slowing down due to less availablity of fuel supply from the reservoirs, so in various Countries scientist are working on a fuel that can be easily made ,has a higher efficiency and can help to reduce pollution (low Carbon emissions). So such types of fuels are known as BIOFUELS. Now coming back to your questions as the research in BIOFUELS are being trending so it will be the most recent topics for your project if you want to standout from the rest . below I am providing you the experiment to check efficiency of a biofuel- 1.\tAim- To measure the energy output during the combustion of biodiesel- petro diesel fuel blends To determine which fuel/fuel blend will optimize energy output 2.\tMaterials required-0.250 L of biodiesel 0.250 L of commercial-grade petro diesel Benzoic acid tablet Iron fuse wire Bomb calorimeter 3.\tMethod of preparation - 1)Place sample in crucible 2)Twist fuse wire onto both ends of calorimeter to allow a current to pass 3)Place wire so it comes in contact with sample 4)Assemble calorimeter 5)Detonate bomb 6)Record temperature change using software 7)When temperature graph asymptotes, remove and clean bomb. 8)Repeat steps 1-7 for other samples 1.\tResult of the experiment/conclusion- Biodiesel yielded 8556.90 kilocalories per litre of fuel combusted. 50-50 biodiesel to petro diesel blend yielded 8415.01 kilocalories per litre of fuel combusted. Petro diesel yielded 8324.81 kilocalories per litre of fuel combusted. 1.\tOverviews and facts-The hypothesis of the experiment was correct. As the percentage of biodiesel increased in a biodiesel-petro diesel fuel blend, the energy output increased in a somewhat proportional manner. This helps to demonstrate the feasibility of biodiesel as a mass-produced alternative fuel. In order to better model this relationship, a greater variety of fuel blends should have been used. This was unable to be accomplished due to time-restraints in the lab. Overall, project was valid. Little systematic error, and the errors caused by uncertainties in lab equipment would only yield a \u00b10.6039% change in the worst-case scenario. This project measured the average energy output during the combustion of biodiesel, commercial-grade petro diesel, and a 50-50 mixture of the two . Learn science love science.\u270c Have a great day ahead. Regards Ankit Chauhan ",
