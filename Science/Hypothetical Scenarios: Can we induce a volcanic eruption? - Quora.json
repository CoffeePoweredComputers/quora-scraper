            "answer_text": "Probably! Look at the eruption of Mount St. Helens that took place on 18 May 1980. At 8 am PDT, that volcano wasn\u2019t erupting - but it was like a badly shaken bottle of fizzy cola being restrained by only the screw-top. A lot of magma was \u2018inside\u2019 and beneath the mountain - but being kept in place and under pressure by the weight of rock on top of it. The buoyancy of the magma had already generated a massive unstable bulge[math]^a[/math] that was deforming the northern side of the mountain. At 08:32, a Magnitude 5.1 earthquake initiated a huge landslide which effectively \u2018unscrewed the cap\u2019. Released from the pressure, the magma was able to react in the same way the cola would - the gases dissolved in the magma \u2018out-gassed\u2019 violently and drove a highly energetic eruption. Now imagine that at 08:25, someone had detonated a large nuclear weapon on that bulge [math]^b[/math]. It isn't too hard to imagine the seismic energy release of the bomb initiating the eruption 7 minutes ahead of schedule. TL:DR Probably not from a standing-start - but if you target a volcano which is already winding-up to blow - you may be able to trigger it early.  [math]^a[/math] Or cryptodome as vulcanologists like to call bulges. [math]^b[/math] A Hiroshima-sized nuke (only about 15\u201320 kilotons) will register about 5.3 on the Richter scale! North Korea has already detonated a bomb of that size - (on 9 September 2016) and they aren\u2019t exactly the world-leaders in nukes. ",

            "answer_text": "Unless we were to somehow create an enormous build up of magma from wishing earths mantle... Then have a high build up of pressure be created and push up on the rock of he mountain... Then induce a chemical reaction so strong that it would force that magma to spew out as lava all over the place, along with a pyroclastic flow..  All of these would be needed because you need a very large amount of pressure for a volcano to erupt. You need magma to come out of the eruption, and you would need continuous pressure from a chemical reaction to force an eruption. Natural eruptions however, do not require such chemical reaction.
