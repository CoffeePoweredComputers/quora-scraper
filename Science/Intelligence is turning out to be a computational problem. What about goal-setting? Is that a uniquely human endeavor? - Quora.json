            "answer_text": "Goal\u2013oriented behavior is a field of study covered by operations research. In its most basic form, operations research is all about the pursuit of personal power (i.e., the power to do, not the power to control and manipulate) as individual actors seek to fulfill the universal wish of being able to make all their wishes come true. That is to say, you cannot want anything without also wanting the power to get that thing because you cannot magically wish anything into existence. Paradoxically, this is true even if the goal you are pursuing is the Zen Buddhist goal of not pursuing goals. To the extent that consciousness might be considered uniquely human, goal\u2013oriented behavior might be considered uniquely human. A better question to ask would be whether and to what extent animals other than humans are capable of acting without being guided by instinct. That is to say, even assuming that there are other primate species or intelligent mammals that are capable of setting goals, symbolic language is unique to humans. Thus, whatever goals other intelligent animals might be able to make or have, they would be unable to communicate those goals in any sort of meaningful way to others. Even if the dialogue arising from symbolic language remains entirely internal, planning of any kind would be limited to fulfilling instinctual desires, absent symbolic language. On this note, a significant amount of research has gone into trying to teach symbolic language to other intelligent mammals. And while there has been some success in teaching primates sign language, it has never been something that they have been inspired to use on their own. In sum, there may be some sort of analog to goal-setting in non-human species, but goal-setting (as we know it) is uniquely human. Added: In reviewing the OP\u2019s question, I realize that I sort of changed the subject with my answer. To wit, it\u2019s not about goal-setting by humans vs. goal-setting by other intelligent species; it\u2019s about whether goal-setting is something that can be operationalized into a computational framework. And I sort of answered that question by referencing operations research, which (in its current state) is largely about number-crunching, but then I changed the subject. In his answer to this question, Paul King makes passing reference to individual goal-setting vs. the goals that are essentially given to individuals by their society or culture. Clich\u00e9 as it sounds, \u201cno man[sic] is an island.\u201d We are all social creatures, and when we are taken away from our social support systems, we quickly become disoriented and confused. On this note, isolation from friends and family and dependency on kidnappers or captors is the primary mechanism by which hostages and/or prisoners of war fall victim to the Stockholm syndrome. Profound psychological disturbances are also common among people who emigrate from their native cultures and start to become acculturated to a new culture with beliefs, morals, values, and commonly-accepted personal goals that are totally exotic to their personal experience. As such, to the extent that an artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) might not readily identify with a particular culture, it might experience an existential crisis; to the extent that an AI is paired with an already existing human consciousness, it would inherit many of the beliefs, morals, values, and personal goals of that human. Ultimately, however, the beliefs, morals, values, and personal goals of AIs will be their own. ",

            "answer_text": "Goals are computational also. Goals are determined by larger goals. If your goal is to find your car keys, your larger goal might be to go to the store, with an even larger goal of throwing a dinner party, with the still larger goal of building a community of friends, etc. Goals are often determined by values, such as being respected, being successful, being liked, etc. or by principles, like acting honestly, keeping commitments, and so on. Values and principles are inferred from parents and role models in the context of the temperament you were born with. Some goals emerge spntaneously to satisfy an emotional need. We might feel that these goals are more \"free\" because they feel non-derived. Other goals come from rational consideration, which we might also say are more free because we are not being a slave to our emotional impulses. In the end, we live within a larger cultural and social context, and goals are just one mechanism for structuring behavior.  ",
