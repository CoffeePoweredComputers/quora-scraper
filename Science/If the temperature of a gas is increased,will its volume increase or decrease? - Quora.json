            "answer_text": "The answer purely depends on the process an ideal gas is undergoing. For a closed system, variation in pressure will give us different volume and temperature relations. Hence the two processes we will consider while answering this question are constant pressure (isobaric) and variable pressure processes. Charles law gives the relationship between temperature and volume. It states that the volume is directly proportional to the temperature at a constant pressure. Here one may easily comment that increase in volume of an ideal gas will result in increase in temperature for an isobaric process. V \u03b1 T.Now we may consider two variable pressure processes, viz. adiabatic and polytropic. The relation between volume and temperature is given as TV^(\u03b3 - 1) = constant, where \u03b3 is adiabatic index as is given by \u03b3= Cp/Cv. As Cp will always be greater than Cv, the term \u03b3 will always be greater than 1 and the exponent will always be a positive value. Here increase in temperature will result in decrease in volume and vice versa. The same case is applicable for polytropic process with polytropic index n greater than 1. The polytropic relation between temperature and volume takes the form of Charles law at n=1. Values of n < 0 are generally of no physical significance except some special cases. One may refer Polytropic process - Wikipedia.Lastly, as we are trying to explain the relationship between volume and temperature, hence we won't consided constant volume (isochoric) and constant temperature (isothermal) processes.",

            "answer_text": "I presume the gas is ideal and its mass constant. Remember the politropic equation: T*V(exp(n-1)) = constant Where n is the politropic coefficient. For n > 1, the increase of temperature means a decrease in volume. See for a better understanding the adiabatic process. For n < 1, an increase in temperature means a volume increase. See the isobaric process, where n = 0 and you can apply the Charles' Law. pV = nRT isn't enough to answer the question, because we need to know how the pressure varies. ",
