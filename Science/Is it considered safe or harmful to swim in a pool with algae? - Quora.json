            "answer_text": "Pool water usually turns green due to one of three reasons. There\u2019s algae and not enough chlorine; there\u2019s too much copper; or, pollen falling from nearby trees has discolored the water. You will know if pollen is the cause because if you swirl your hand through the water, the pollen with move. If it\u2019s algae, it blooms, grows and sticks to the sides and bottom of the pool. You won\u2019t die from swimming in the algae or copper-laden water. But, chances are, when you come out, your skin will itch as if you had rolled in fiberglass. Do yourself a favor and get the water tested; treat it and then enjoy a nice dunk! Also, if the pool water has turned green because of copper, you will notice your fingernails, bathing suits and hair will be tinged green. A good soapy shower will remove the green tint. ",
