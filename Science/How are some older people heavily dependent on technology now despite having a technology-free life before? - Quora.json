            "answer_text": "Line of least resistance in many cases, I suspect. However, being accustomed to letter writing - as we were - the email phenomenon was something we embraced with enthusiasm. Our kids fixed us up with a basic PC, showed us which buttons to push and off we went! Most of us were accustomed to a typewriter so we just accepted the magic and continued to correspond as we always had. Then, our doting offspring introduced us to Facebook and we discovered the joy of instant chat. It was noticeable, apparently, that \u2018younger viewers\u2019 had long since gone on to greater things before cyber space became crowded out by \u2018silver surfers\u2019 exchanging pictures of the grandkids and complaints about poor quality sausages. Some were left behind at this point - my ex has never conquered the complexities of Facebook - and restricted themselves to the occasional email. We dropped like flies after that. The older we were, the more befuddled our brains became under that thinning white fuzz. We did, however, discover Google and the amazing realisation that we no longer had to plunge into obscure library books in order to gain information. It was all right there - at our finger tips! - if we could just conquer a tiny bit more technology. So many of us did just that! Fantastic development- well worth the effort! Beyond mastering the odd computer game, I don\u2019t think I, personally, would have ventured much further after that \u2026 except that the old fashioned way of handling things like bill paying, bank accounts, council affairs were rapidly becoming obsolete! \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a computer!?\u201d became the new way of saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s time we popped you into a care home, dear!\u201d Then \u2026 we got to 2020! Technology took on an entirely different meaning! It\u2019s how we talk, face to face, with our families. It\u2019s how we share experiences with friends. It\u2019s how we do our shopping, attend yoga and painting classes, follow world events and watch baby foxes playing on someone else\u2019s lawn! The old and bewildered finally realised technology wasn\u2019t just a passing fad for the young - it was a vital communication tool for the world! ",

            "answer_text": "How are some older people heavily dependent on technology now despite having a technology-free life before? Virtually no one alive today has ever had a \u201ctechnology-free life,\u201d with the possible exception of \u201cuncontacted peoples\u201c and people who live in communities that shun technology, like the Amish. Even people who were born in Third World countries a hundred years ago grew up with access to complex machinery powered by fossil fuels, commonly known as trains, planes, and automobiles, as well as things like telephones, radios, cameras, and semi-automatic weapons. When I tutored a friend of mine on the basics of electronics, I found myself using a book shelved in the open stacks at Shields Library, UC Davis. That book was published around the year 1900, and used plumbing diagrams to explain electronic circuits. Perhaps what the original poster is referring to is the fact that modern technology is often very different from technology that was around ten, twenty, or thirty years ago, and the reason that \u201colder people\u201d embrace that newer technology is because it is often much easier to use.  See: The Hydraulic Analogy for Electric Current Nowadays, I wouldn\u2019t trust myself to change a flat tire, as my iPhone can now summon someone who changes a hundred flat tires a day for a fraction of the billable time I would lose. However, there was a time when I would change my own flat tires as well as my own engine oil, and replace worn out or broken car parts like the spark plugs, points, alternator, and water pump. I wouldn\u2019t have the slightest idea how to do any of that anymore. ",

The technology older people used was different, not nonexistent. Besides, who do you think pioneered all the stuff you think of as technology? The technology that led to WiFi came into being in the 1940\u2019s. The first programable computer dates from the 1930\u2019s. The first electric programable computer dates from the 1940\u2019s. The first digital computer was completed in 1946. To jump forward a bit, the first personal computer showed up in the 1970\u2019s. Apple computers started in 1976 - not 2006. Don\u2019t dismiss an older person just because they may be having a bit of trouble with the latest thing - for all you know, they helped lay the foundations for that latest thing to come into existence.
