This is the text from the first paragraph of Edisonn\u2019s Invention, Patent # 223,898: Be it known that I, THOMAS ALVA EDDISON, of Menlo Park, in the State of New Jersey, United 8ates of America, have invented an improvement in Electric Lamps, and in the method of manufacturing the same, (Case No. 186) of which the following is a specification. In the text, he freely admits it is an improvement on an existing Lamp. But who improved on the bulb by having a screw base with a centre contact? That is where it gets sticky. ",

            "answer_text": "Edison developed the bulb with the intention of making it a commercial success. He needed a bulb with sufficient life time, but he also realized it had to have a high resistance so it could operate at a fairly high voltage, namely 110V. And it had to be affordable. If the bulb were made to operate at 6 or 12V, it would require massive copper wiring. A 12V system would require wires 10X the diameter of a 120V system; that\u2019s 100x as much copper. So he need a long thin filament that wouldn\u2019t easily break or burn out. Edison also developed the entire infrastructure, with power plants, bulb factories, switches, fuses, etc. Early Light Bulbs ",

            "answer_text": "It is generally accepted that Joseph Swan, from my home town of Sunderland, invented the electric light bulb independently, at the same time as Edison. Both were granted patents in 1879 in their respective home countries. Swan\u2019s patents lead to Edison and Swan merging their companies in the UK, forming the Edison and Swan Electric Light Company, producing light bulbs and later valves and cathode ray tubes under the Ediswan and Mazda trade names.

To put it simple Edison made the bulb be capable of being mass produced and last longer then the original bulb by swan. So someone else invented it before him, he improved on it, hll even the patent in his name says its an improvement and edison also admitted it as such,. ",

The arc-vapor bulb predated Edison\u2019s bulb. It was too bright. Edison\u2019s vacuum carbon bulb was just bright enough. Edison took credit for the double \u201cvacuuming\u201d of the bulb. When you pumped the air out of the bulb, it would yet burn up. Burning up meant oxygen was being used? By double pumping the air out of the bulb, the air \u201cdissolved\u201d in the glass came out.
