            "answer_text": "Volcanoes are a reminder that the Earth is tectonically active and dynamically alive after 4 billion years. The Earth is a water planet and 71% of the surface is covered by water. Volcanoes are one means of forming a new land mass and resurfacing the existing exposed rocks. Volcanoes forming over a hot spot built the Hawaiian Island chain in the middle of the Earth\u2019s largest ocean. Volcanoes also punctuate the \u201cRing of Fire\u201d that encircles the Pacific Plate. Plate movement tractors ocean crust below the lighter continental land masses and lifts them up. If volcanism stops this would be an indication that planet-wide tectonics has ceased, which would spell disaster for terrestrial life. In the event tectonics stopped the existing exposed land above sea level would erode away never to be reformed. Life on land is more diverse than marine life but as the land mass disappeared diversity would also disappear. The Earth would eventually be covered by water. The fact that volcanoes continue to form is a consequence of the Earth\u2019s circulating molten outer core. No more tectonics would be an indication that the outer core was cooling and the dynamo that generates the Earth\u2019s magnetic field would be failing next. Without the protective magnetic field, the upper atmosphere would be stripped away by the solar wind and life on the surface would be exposed to cosmic rays from outside the solar system. The cosmic rays would play havoc with DNA and cause lethal mutations at the cellular level.  As dangerous as volcanoes can be, without them the world we know would slowly die. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you ment to ask if the biosphere part of the earth would survive without rivers. My opinion is that it would in some form. Rivers are a consequence of rainfall, springs, and topography. They are the geomorphic consequence of the surface flow of water across a surface which can be eroded by that flow. So if there were much less precipitation and only enough water to have ground water, something would still grow. But since you asked if the earth could survive without water, that phrasing implies the possibility that you believe the earth is \u2018alive\u2019 and are asking if it would die of thirst without rivers. To that question my answer is that, to me at least, it is not a living object and therefore the question has no answer. ",

A planet without water and heat is entropic and will remain that way forever until one or both act on it . A river of ants do not have any need of humans and will keep the forest floor reasonably clean. A good woman's cooking is natural intelligence to a hungry stomach. ",

It indicates to me that the tectonic plates would remain stationary on the globe. No change in ocean currents, things like El nino might stop occurring, and the planet would probably no longer be dynamic place - maybe the death of Earth. In reality - who knows? ",
