            "answer_text": "Why do some cotransport proteins use a concentration gradient for energy instead of ATP? Short answer: To passively transport molecules across membranes, via their \u201cdownhill\u201d gradient, no energy is needed (in addition to the potential energy of the gradient). Wikipedia articles: Passive transports \u2014 also called facilitated diffusion \u2014 follow an electrochemical gradient concentration \u201cdownhill,\u201d no additional energy needed (see the left four coupled transports in the image below). Like drifting downstream (at rest) in a kayak, .Active transports \u2014 move molecules against their concentration gradient \u201cpressure,\u201d ATP supplies the needed energy (see the right Na+/K+-ATPase \u201cion pump\u201d animation in the image below). Like paddling upstream (doing work) in a kayak. For the Na[math]^+[/math]/K[math]^+[/math] ATPase active membrane transport principles of operation, see Quora question Can Electricity be Generated by Neurons? ",
