            "answer_text": "About: the concept of shell, subshell, and orbitals Let me explain with two examples: the hydrogen atom and the carbon atom. Hydrogen has 1 electron in the neutral atom which is found in a shell (with one subshell) consisting of one spherically symmetric orbital. We say that in the lowest energy state of the atom the electron will be found in this spherical volume centered on the nucleus. Carbon has 6 electrons in two shells. The first shell is similar to the one orbital of hydrogen except is filled to its maximum occupancy of 2 electrons with opposite spins. The second shell is similar to the first one except it is larger and contains two subshells, the second subshell consists of 3 orbitals with a different symmetry. Atomic orbital - Wikipedia  So, altogether the carbon atom has 5 orbitals all centered on the nucleus. 1s2 , 2s2 , 2px1 , 2py1 , 2pz0 The third p-orbital is empty. Carbon - Wikipedia You may find the electron configuration also written like this: 1s2 2s2 2p2 or [He]2s2 2p2 which is the same configuration. ",
