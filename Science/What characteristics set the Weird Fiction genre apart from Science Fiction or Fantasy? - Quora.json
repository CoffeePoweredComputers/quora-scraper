            "answer_text": "The things in a story that push it into the murky, sometimes contested waters of weird fiction are many. Additionally, any of those things can be found across the breadth of the genre spectrum. Fantasy, science fiction, horror are heavily represented for sure, sometimes a blend of several. This genre is still largely undefined as having discreet edges of any kind. The tropes are there, of course. And, yes, dark thematic elements are usually present, but not necessarily. In my opinion, weird fiction is fiction of any genre, science fiction and fantasy included, that is modified in a way that instills a sense in the reader of being off center. That is, it usually presents as an internal journey from the real to the surreal; the comfortable to the uncomfortable. It explores the mental, spiritual and corporeal consequences awarded characters who somehow come into some body of knowledge or experience that many times challenges the nature of existence itself. But it is usually an internal view of this dynamic as an unraveling of the truth. In its inaugural era, nearly a century ago, these themes usually surrounded characters who started out experiencing life in a mundane way, perhaps investigating some earthly crime which would eventually lead to a realization\u2014not just the fear, but the reality\u2014 that human beings are insignificant on a cosmic level and wholly without purpose save for the will and pleasure of sometimes malevolent, sometimes oddly indifferent forces that exist outside the normal realm of human perception. This, to the 1920s mind, had to have been horrifying and, well, weird. It has been evolving ever since, finding its way into different settings and genres. And not all weird fiction goes as big as the whole cosmic reveal thing. Some is subtle and local. Weird fiction creates a feeling; a feeling that leaves the reader feeling unsafe, unimportant, unraveled, uninvited and unable to do anything about it accept try and stuff it all back in the container it was packaged in, hoping to go back to the way it was before it all unfolded, which of course never works. So in conclusion, I would not say that weird fiction can be compared to science fiction and fantasy in a traditional way. Instead, I would say that something becomes weird fiction, regardless of its parent genre, when it creates the mood textures and feelings I described. Really, weird fiction is like a drug that a story takes with good intentions but ends up having a bad trip. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people say weird fiction isn't so much a genre as it is a style or mode of writing. In that regard, some science fiction and fantasy can be considered weird fiction. In fact, many science fiction and fantasy authors have been considered purveyors of the weird. What makes weird fiction weird is its reliance on unnatural effects. This might include elements of magical realism, slipstream, blending or mixing of genres, fantastical elements, a focus on the grotesque, the macabre, surrealist writing techniques, and bizarre character qualities. This is just to name a few. Weird fiction genres might include  Horror Science fictionFantasyNoirPulpSlipstreamSpeculative fictionNew WeirdBizarroCyberpunkSplatterpunkThere may be more. Weird fiction is most often considered a subgenre of speculative fiction, which often encompasses science fiction and fantasy as well as horror and their various subgenres. ",
