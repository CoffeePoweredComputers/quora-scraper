            "answer_text": "Neon tubes do not contain mercury. They contain neon. But I have to wonder if you really broke a neon tube. Neon glows in the color orange. Neon tubes are used to make glowing signs and artwork. There are other gases that glow in different colors that are mixed to give different colors.They are not usually in kitchens. I have one in my kitchen but it is in a clock and is decorative. Florescent tubes glow white and are used for lighting. They do contain a small amount of elemental mercury, but this kind of mercury is not dangerous in the amounts found in a florescent tube. The broken glass is. Carefully clean it up and dispose of it properly. You can put the larger parts in a paper bag and bust them into smaller parts that will fit into a garbage can. Use a dust pan a sweep the up what you can, then put vacuum the floor and anything else the glass might has fallen on. Wear shoes. Check the shoes to see if any glass got stuck in the soles. Discard any open food. A single shard of this glass can cause some serious troubles if ingested. ",

            "answer_text": "Most likely, by neon tube, you mean florescent lamps? Because neon tubes are expensive and are specialty lamps, and not easily available nowadays. In certain parts of Asia, they use to crush the glasses of the florescent lamp and then mixed it with animal glue to coat kite strings. These are for fighting kites, and they uses the kite string to cut other kite strings. Pretty spectacular, the way they could weave the kites and kite lines over each other. Pretty dangerous too, as the thread can sever a person necks. This is outlawed in Malaysia, but it still happens. So if you see kite fighting going on especially in the rural area, be careful, especially don\u2019t chase after fallen kites. You can blame a Dutch glass manufacturer for this part of this problem, because they made the hardest, sharpest, clearest, flint glass in the market. ( The same way you can blame blade smiths for dangerous people with knives, I suppose.) I don\u2019t think they care about the mercury, just that they can obtain and break a florescent tube more easily than bulbs, I think.  If you still think this is not true, check these link: India: Three killed after kite strings slit throats, Thai police warn people to stop flying kites after motorcyclist is nearly strangled, Man \u2018ambushed\u2019 by kite-string. When I was young, I used to chase after those fallen kites, too. So yes, broken florescent tubes in the hands of kite fighting idiots is dangerous. ",
