            "answer_text": "The moon produces a physical effect over planet Earth, and it is the cause of the rise and fall of the tides. The moon\u2019s gravitational pull exerted over the Earth produces a deformation on our planet, stretching it in those places where the pull is stronger, phenomenon known as \u201cgravity gradient\u201d. Since the Earth\u2019s ground is solid, this pull affects more significantly the oceanic waters, generating a slight movement towardsthe moon, and also producing a less evident movement in the opposite direction; this is why the ocean\u2019s level rise and fall twice a day. So, if we consider that the actual gravitational pull of the moon create the tides, even with the moon being sofar away from Earth, then billions of years ago, when the Moon was so close to our planet, the tides producedin the interaction between this two bodies must have been really huge. Incredibly large waves of water would have covered hundreds of miles of the surface. If the tides of our times reachup to tens of meters high, in those early days that height would have been of tens of kilometers. The colossal waves of the early Earth would swept large areas of the ground, dragging in the process high amounts of minerals and chemicals into the ocean depths. This diversity of chemicals and minerals, agitated bythe extreme tides, exposed to very high amounts of radiation and energy received from the sun, after millions of years of reactions and interactions, would have form a primordial soup of organic molecules. Once this molecules gain complexity, this wouldlead to the formation of amino acids, which are the main functional block ofproteins, and these occupy a place of utmost importance among the constituent molecules of living organisms and play a key role in life. In addition to the tides, there is another gravitational effect produced by the moon upon which the life on Earth depends: the Moon is responsible for maintaining stable the climate of our planet. The moon\u2019s gravitational effect maintains constant the inclination degree of the rotational axis of the Earth, and this inclination is what keeps stable the season\u2019s cycle as the Earth orbits the Sun. It can be demonstrated mathematically that if the moon hadn't existed or had been much smaller, the slope of our poles would be very different and the inclination angle would be changed about 90 degrees. The actual inclination angle of the Earth is 23.5 degrees, and it remains unchanged over time. But without the gravitational force exerted by the moon it would vary chaotically, which could have devastating consequencesto to the climate and to the life on our planet. Our natural satellite has been, and still continues to be of crucial importance for the stability of the rotational axis of our planet, and consequently our climate. Without the presence of the moon and its gravitational effect, the Earth would complete a rotation every 8 hours instead of 24, so one year on Earth would consist of 1095 days of 8 hours each. With a rotational speed as high as this, the winds would be much more powerful and violent than we know today, the atmosphere would have much more oxygen and the planet\u2019s magnetic field would be three times more intense. Under these so different conditions, it is reasonable to assume that if plant and animal life would have developed, it would have evolved completely differently than it actually has. The 24-hour days in the rotation of our planet greatly favors the life forms that inhabit it, since the temperature variations are not too abrupt in the transition from day to night, as they would be in days of only 8 hours. As we can see, there are a lot of conditions and events that must be met for advanced life forms like humans to develop on a planet. We have analyzed several reasons why the Moon, our traveling partner aroundthe Sun, can be of vital importance for life on Earth. And these are only a tiny fraction of the huge number of conditions and factors that had to occur in a certain way so that today each of us can live their lives in this planet. ",

            "answer_text": "Because ORBITS. Because SPACE JUNK. Because TIDE (disputeably) And because WEREWOLVES. But, arguably, the first two are intertwined and the most important. To keep the inner system free of most junk, we have jupiter. Which deflects stuff towards then away from it. Closer to us though, we have the moon. Due to the combined center of gravity of this system, random stuff is WAY less likely to hit the earth due to the moon being around to mess with it\u2019s incoming orbit. Tide keeps oceans sloshing. This may or may not be important or critical for life. After all, it means near the shore there will be cyclic \u2018dry/wet/dry/wet\u2019 cycles every day, forcing evolution onto a path where it can deal with that. In theory. It may keep stuff mixed. it might not. but. (humor) And, lastly, THINK ABOUT THE WEREWOLVES, without the moon, what would they do? Seriously, how insensitive. (/humor) ",
