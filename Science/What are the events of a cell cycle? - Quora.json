            "answer_text": "Cell Cycle is a complete cycle which includes Interphase (rest period) and cell division period ( Mitosis or Meiosis). Interphase includes- G1, S and G2 phase. In G1 phase cellular contents excluding chromosomes are duplicated. In S phase DNA replication takes place. In G2 phase other contents like proteins are formed plus all repairs checked. then Mitosis and Meiosis takes place. Interphase is much longer compared to division time because cells gets prepared for division. Mitosis takes place in somatic cells where cell division is required for growth and repair, whereas Meiosis takes place in sex cells. ",
