            "answer_text": "It depends how you consider it. The usual and consensual way to answer is to say, that in the Copenhagen interpretation, quantum mechanics is individually non-deterministic. But it is not exactly right. This answer is right if we consider just a single individual quantum system. Then quantum mechanics can predict some probabilities of outcome of measurements of a specific observable. And the measured outcome finally obtained during the experiment is always part of the scope of state values predicted by the theory. But, at the opposite of classical physics, quantum theory isn\u2019t concerned with individual systems, (even worse, quantum mechanics is completely blind to our notion of \u201cindividual\u201d) but is concerned by large/huge ensemble of quantum systems (for instance imagine the enormous number of such quantum systems constituting a simple chair or a table\u2026) The physical state of a specific quantum system is completely embodied in its wave-function or its state vector if we perform a measurement. This abstract object contains all the information that is possible to be extracted from the quantum system. It encodes all possible states of the quantum system we can obtain if we make the measurement of an observable. With every possible state is associated a probability (complex number) to obtain this state for a single measurement. But as a result, after a large number of repetitions of the same experiment (same state preparation of the quantum system and same experimental setup), the statistical results obtained will match exactly the probabilities of every state as contained in the wave-function. It means that the wave function (or the state vector) gives the exact deterministic result of a \u201cglobal measurement\u201d, obtained from the compilation of a huge number of measurements operated on quantum systems all prepared in the same conditions. Therefore, from an individual point of view, quantum mechanics is clearly non-deterministic and the outcome of a measurement is always random. But at the opposite, from a collective (or ensemble) point of view, quantum mechanics is clearly and definitely globally deterministic, as the statistical collection of all outcomes of measurement match exactly the predictions of the wave-function. Thus we are allowed to conclude that quantum mechanics is individually non-deterministic but collectively or globally, fully deterministic. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a simple deterministic argument! First let me say that I strongly believe Einstein saying that God does not play dice. I think it is rather silly to sugget that such a tightly constructed universe moves according to the throw of a die. Probability is an extremely useful notion in treating nature.. but it should only mean that the world is \u2018rigidly deterministic\u2019, but the problem at hand is so intractable, that we are happy to solve it by approximation using probability. Normally the reason for the complication in a physical problem is due to the huge number of participating players. This then results in the impossibility of following every and each one of the variables, and we are forced to solve the prediction problem by treating chunks of variables as single variables. Because of this, the prediction becomes not exact but only probabilistic. The best example on this is the problem of predicting the behaviour of the die itself. The laws that govern the motion of dice are fully deterministic, but are impossible to lay down, let alone solve. Because we need to take the air effects with everything- including its physical and thermodynamic properties. You need to take the shape of the dice also. You need to take the starting position of the hand and every little shake in it, and every twitch that will later determine the outcome of a throw. And you need to take into account the properties of the table itself- geometrical and physical. Clearly it is impossible to consider all the above, so we say that whatever factors are at play, we know that the outcome is eventually constrained.. the die must fall onto one of its six faces, this gives a probability of 1/6 to get any one of them. But \u2018tacitly\u2019 we have assumed something about the collective effects of all the other variables by saying that the throw is \u2018completely random\u2019 for example. We know that there are some people who are capable of getting a six in every throw for example, but they are outside the model. Take now the pilot wave idea. As a model it has the draw back of being not intuitive, and there is no evidence for such guide waves. It also appears to suffer from inconsistencies and conflicts with other established theories. But the idea is quite appealing by itself, and way better than trying to imagine that the electron is a wave distributed over space, or cloning itself before the slit, or whatever. After all, we see a strange behaviour for electrons in a double slit- it is the appearance of interference patterns similar to how real waves behave. Is it possible to salvage this model? I think yes and easily; The electron behaves as a particle before the slit, but changes to a wave in the slit. So clearly the behaviour is a result of the interaction with the slit. The interaction is approximately electrostatic of the inverse square type. But this law changes on confinement- that is many particles and small displacement, into Hook\u2019s or the space spring law. That is from f=k/r^2 to f=K r. We know that a mass and a spring and a kick results in oscillations. And this is exactly what happens to the electron. You could imagine the whole region just before, at and just after the slit, changing to a harmonic force field or a spatial filter that \u2018guides\u2019 the electron- even when singly shot through the slit to form the observed interference pattern. The behaviour of a falling bead in the binomial distribution experiment is a good example of the idea. To check this idea further, I did numerical experiments in which charged (and later uncharged) particles are shot towards a wall of charged particles with gaps, and it resulted in a wave pattern and interference in the path of the particles. I was even able to get complete back scatter and de-coherence in the interference pattern just like what happens to waves. That was a deterministic explanation of what happens in the double slit experiment and similar explanations can be found to the other supposedly fully probabilistic events mentioned in QM. But this is not a deterministic interpretation of QM. You can\u2019t have a deterministic QM and still be able to predict the behaviour of electrons whizzing round the atom at near the speed of light. You need to be probabilistic in order to give a gross not exact answers. It is similar to using probability in statistical thermodynamics for example.. the subject is probabilistic by definition and use. And only probability can handle the behaviour of Avogadro number of molecules using simple algebraic equations. ",
