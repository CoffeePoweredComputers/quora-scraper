            "answer_text": "Kinetic energy is possessed by a body by the virtue of its motion. What does that mean ? Well think you are running with a constant velocity v, you must have some kind of energy due to your running , this energy is called kinetic energy . This energy is directly related to your mass and your velocity squared . Now think of a rubber band. When you stretch that rubber band , it wants to go back . That is it acquired a energy due to its unstable position . If you are in a mountain top you have a high gravitational potential energy. Now the question you asked, the answer to that depends on situation. Potential energy in most cases gets transformed into kinetic energy. But in case of a pendulum , or any orbiting planet or satellite or celestial object we see a wonderful conversion of potential energy to kinetic . And vice versa. Let me explain why one energy increases the latter decreases . Let's talk about a pendulum. You give that Bob some energy by taking it to a height . As you pull the bob upwards your energy is getting converted as the gravitational potential energy. Because energy needs to be conserved. So the work you do to to lift the bob gets stored as the gravitational potential energy. When you let it go, the bob becomes unstable because the force is getting applied on it. So in order to reach stability it's PE starts getting converted into kinetic energy. With time the kinetic energy increases but the PE decreases . This happens due to two reason : 1) energy need to be conserved 2) as the body goes towards stability it's PE DECREASES (because PE is strictly due to the unstable position of the body) but as energy needs to be conserved it's kinetic energy increases as a collateral . So it's really all about conservation of energy. Now when the bob converts all the potential onto kinetic and still failed to reach stability and get rid of its energy ,due to its inertia it swings towards it's unstable position , as it gets more unstable it's speed slows down and it's kinetic energy gets converted into potential energy. This continues . Hope this helped . ",

            "answer_text": "Consider a case of freely falling rubber ball When it was held at height say 10 meters, it is held up against gravitational attraction of earth. Once released it will displace height of 10 meter towards the ground under the action of gravity. As the work could be done on expense of energy that means the ball has energy when it was held at height of 10 meter. It is called as gravitational potential energy given as mgh. Now as it is dropped, the gravitational potential energy of ball is being used up, to accelerate towards the ground. As the velocity increases from zero, the kinetic energy of the descending ball increases. given by [math]\\dfrac{1}{2} mv^2[/math] As the potential energy is decreasing while accelerating downward, the kinetic energy increases. But the total energy of the ball remains the same which means when it reaches the ground whole of its potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy. So according to law of conservation of energy [math](mgh)_{\\text{at h =}10 \\ m} = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}mv^2\\right)_{\\text{at ground}}[/math] ",
