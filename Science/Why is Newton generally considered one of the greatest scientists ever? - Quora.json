            "answer_text": "A little bit of a loaded question, but I won't argue the point. Though I dislike Isaac Newton as a person, and think that Einstein may have exceeded him, one can make a good argument that Newton was the greatest scientist ever. Indeed, Einstein himself made such an argument as has Hawkings in his first book. Boiled down, the argument is that if Francis Bacon conceived of the scientific method, and Galileo first applied accurate measurement to science, Newton brought in rigorous mathematics. Mathematics is the language of nature and in combination with his keen observations and experiments, Newton used it to break open the most fundamental laws. He cracked the code of physics. This led to a multitude of great scientists and a myriad of discoveries. It's not unfair to say that most technology can be traced to Newton. In fact he did such a good job that it wasn't until Einstein that science saw things any other way. Great success can block future imagination. And science can always be improved on. But Newton made the Great Leap Forward that has forever transformed the human race and the world view of educated men that now relies on humanism and a clockwork universe. ",

            "answer_text": "It was the great poet of the Enlightenment, Alexander Pope, who said: Nature and Nature\u2019s Laws lay hid in Night; God said \u201cLet Newton be!\u201d and all was light. The impact of Newton, not just on science, but on all of Western Civilization, as well as world history, cannot be overstated\u2026 Before Newton, even the greatest scientists (such as Copernicus) rarely could do more than observe Nature and make a few general observations. One of the very few who was able to come up with anything resembling a \u201cLaw\u201d was Galileo, who was the first to formulate the principle of uniform acceleration of objects toward the Earth. But Newton went far beyond anything anyone had done before. He came up with a simple mathematical model, meticulously working out the complex mathematical consequences, and in doing so replaced a universe that was \u201chid in Night\u201d with a universe in which it seemed \u2014 at least for hundreds of years \u2014 that in theory there was a set of precise laws that described and determined everything that ever happened. Even if Newton himself didn\u2019t say it, the Western World responded to Newton\u2019s accomplishments by deciding that the universe itself was really supremely Rational after all\u2026 it was just that we needed Newton to show us the way, by utilizing the genius of his mathematics. Ever since then, the natural sciences as well as the social sciences have aspired toward this \u201cNewtonian\u201d ideal\u2026 that if you could just examine all the data and come up with the right mathematical models, then you could see that the cause and effect of every event in the universe was governed by some rational formula. And that therefore, there was in theory nothing the mind of man could not predict, explain, comprehend, and ultimately control. Since then, the 20th Century stumbled upon some new conceptions\u2026 such as quantum mechanics and Chaos Theory\u2026 that showed that this Newtonian spirit was perhaps a little bit too optimistic. Even so, the search for a set of \u201cNewtonian\u201d Laws to explain the universe still goes on. So great was the change in attitude about Man\u2019s relationship to Nature, that history should always been seen as being divided into two major epochs\u2026 civilization before Newton and civilization after Newton. His contribution was that immense. ",
