            "answer_text": "That is a very good question and one that physicists, philosophers, and theologians have discussed since Newton (and probably before). In Newtonian mechanics each event causes the next one and so forth. With the discovery of atoms however we realized the large objects are actually made up of small parts that do NOT follow these laws. When you average together the behavior of enough atoms you get the expected result plus or minus a small amount of uncertainty. Einstein greatly improved our understanding of this with is work on the Photoelectric Effect for which he won a Nobel Prize. (Most people think he won a Nobel Prize for Relativity, but that\u2019s incorrect.) Einstein\u2019s work showed that individually atoms act like dice, BUT Einstein vehemently opposed the idea that \u201cGod plays with dice.\u201d I personally believe that humans have souls, but even without that we must consider the complex chemistry of the brain and how decisions are made. The brain uses many complex chemical reactions and combines them together, BUT it does NOT average them. If you have a large piece of aluminum and hit it with something, you can predict with nearly infinite certainty what the block as whole will do. You can predict what each atom at the point of collision is most likely to do, but not what it will actually do. Human decisions are made from chemicals in the brain that act like those atoms at the collision point on the aluminum, not like the whole block. Your statement about atoms indicates a common misconception. The movement of atoms is actually only probabilistic \u2014 they will probably go in a particular direction but they are NOT Newtonian objects. We can not say that they \u201cchoose\u201d which way to go \u2014 but they are not deterministic the way we often think they are. Many students incorrectly believe that this uncertainty in the motion of atoms is the result of an inability to measure the atoms rather than a property of the atoms themselves, but this is incorrect. It is true that measuring devices have limits, but the atoms themselves have limits. We can say that they themselves \u201cdo not know\u201d their own speed and position \u201cexactly\u201d and this is an actual, physical property of atoms. This is as much a \u201cLAW\u201d as f=ma and the Newtonian \u201claws\u201d that supposedly make the future \u201cpredetermined.\u201d So yes, in short, we do have \u201cfree will.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "An interesting problem which dates back to the idea of the \u201cclockwork universe\u201d which followed Newton\u2019s theories. The thinking goes that if the universe is truly deterministic and started from a particular point then surely all it\u2019s future actions, including those of any people, were pre-determined. At best, we\u2019d just have an illusion of free will, but in reality our decisions are pre-determined. At the time of Newton this didn\u2019t cause to much of a controversy as, to the religious minded (or at least those from Abrahamic faiths), the essence of the person was not determined by mere physical phenomenon. Freewill was god-given and part of their spirit and hence not part of the corporeal world. It was therefore not governed by physical laws. However, as the influence of religion faded then this issue came back to haunt, especially those who didn\u2019t believe in a deity. With the emergence of Quantum Mechanics, physicists realised that in a very fundamental way the universe is not deterministic. It is, really, based on probability and uncertainty woven into the whole structure. In addition, chaos theory tells us that the outcome of even the simplest non-linear systems can produce wildly unpredictable outcomes unless we know the starting conditions of a system absolutely perfectly (which QM tells us we can\u2019t). QM would therefore appear to get us out of this \u201cclockwork universe\u201d catch and open a gap for free will to emerge. However, even this doesn\u2019t appear quite true. It just allows for a probabilistic outcome of a decision, not the controlled one that true free will would appear to require. There is, perhaps, a bit of evidence that much of our free-will is a really an illusion. Experiments have demonstrated that we often appear to make decisions. Neuroscientists can now observe behaviour in the brain at the time of decision making and it has become clear that some are made before we become consciously aware of a phenomenon. It is, in effect, our sub-conscious activities making the decision for us. We see this in sports of course - no tennis player could hit a ball correctly if he/she had to think consciously about exactly where the ball was going to be. However, there\u2019s also evidence that our subconscious also makes value judgements. There is plenty of experimental evidence our reaction to, say, race, is often not conscious. Indeed what the conscious mind often appears to do is censor our unconscious reactions. On another point, Roger Penrose in his book The Emperor\u2019s New Mind claims that the behaviour of the brain (and hence consciousness) cannot be modelled mathematically, including as that of a quantum mechanical system as we currently know it. He claims to have proved that there is no way that consciousness can emerge from such a system. He has further elaborated this by claiming that there is an enormous gap between the quantum (non-deterministic) word and that of the classical (deterministic) world. His position is that there is a massive gap in our physical explanation of the world when something transitions from this quantum state to the classical one (the same sort of space occupied by Schrodinger\u2019s cat) and that it is in this new, unexplained, non-computational part of physics wherein will lie the solution to the enigma of consciousness and, by implication, free will. Naturally Penrose\u2019s position is highly controversial, especially in the area of Artificial Intelligence and the physics is speculative indeed (although he\u2019s \u201conly\u201d claiming a gap).
