            "answer_text": "Why do banana peels taste horrible? Bananas whose peels contain lots of tannin survive to successfully grow the next generation of plants. Most animals, including insects, that might eat the banana or lay eggs in it so the young can eat it, don\u2019t have hands to open the peel and are repelled by the taste when they try to bite it open. Bonus info: Notice how only humans open bananas by trying to rip off the stem. Other banana-eating species pinch open or attack the bottom end of the peel. ",
