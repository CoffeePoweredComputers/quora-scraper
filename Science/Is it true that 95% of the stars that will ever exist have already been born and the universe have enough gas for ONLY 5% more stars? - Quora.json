So the correct way to say it is \u201cfrom its peak value 3.5 billion years after the Big Bang, the rate of stellar formation has decreased exponentially towards the value it has now, 3% of the peak. So only 5% of the known number of stars will be formed in the future, even if we wait forever\u201d. Star Formation Sputtering Out Across the Universe ",

Earth will be gone in a few billion years and there are planets that are the size of a marble now that will be the size of earth by then. The universe is infinite as far as we know, who knows what happens a thousand or a million light years away. At the fastest speed we can travel now, it would take 125,000 years to get to proxima centauri, the next closest solar system. Biological being like us will never last long enough, we will have to be able to transfer our being to a mechanical computer device to achieve that. ",
