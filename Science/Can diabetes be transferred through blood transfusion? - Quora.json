            "answer_text": "It is highly unlikely, unless the person had a dangerously low blood glucose to begin with. Packed red cells do not usually have enough liquid to contribute enough glucose to increase blood glucose levels. There is glucose (dextrose) in the liquid to feed the red cells, which need an energy source, but by the time the blood is transfused, even several units would be unlikely to have much effect, unless the person is a type 1 diabetic and the prbc units are all very fresh. It is not unusual to also give IV fluids, which contain glucose. The people giving the transfusion do need to check glucose, and that check would be fairly routine even if the patient were not getting a transfusion. Changes in blood glucose from a transfusion, however, would not be a particularly significant concern for a patient who is ill enough to require a transfusion. It is inconceivable that blood glucose would increase enough to be a concern, because the glucose content of the fluid in a prbc unit for transfusion only contains enough glucose to keep the red cells from dying. To repeat, only if the person in question had a dangerously low blood glucose to start with would a significant increase be likely. In that case, they would most likely be getting IV fluids with glucose anyway. ",

            "answer_text": "As we\u2019re not entirely sure what causes type I diabetes, this question is far from easy to answer. There are some that maintain that this is primarily an autoimmune disease and there are those that believe that some pathogen, probably a virus is involved. There is always a risk of transmitting diseases with a blood transfusion and for this reason we don\u2019t give transfusions unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. We also generally exclude individuals with diabetes, cancer, hepatitis, HIV and other chronic diseases and infections from being blood donors as we know that there is a risk that some of these conditions can or could potentially be spread with a blood transfusion. Type II diabetes on the other hand is a metabolic disorder that is primarily connected to lifestyle and genetic susceptibility and those can't be transferred through a blood transfusion. ",

Diabetics carry more glucose than the average donor \u2026 you might think great, more sugar to boost the recipient but more sugar (glucose) also can stimulate bacterial growth. The 35 day expiration date is based on people with normal blood sugars \u2026 changing that dynamic destroys the research that the 35 days is based on. Diabetics have more chance of bacteria in the blood because they don\u2019t know, with their diminished feeling (peripheral neuropathy), that they have stepped on a nail. So in my day, diabetics were not allowed to donate. There is more demand for blood these days, so maybe they have changed that. ",
