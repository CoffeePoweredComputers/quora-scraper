            "answer_text": "Well structured and logic thinking when in depth - has always been a way to search out truth in regard to the human being and what surrounds us. Therefor is philosophy the mother of science - and science as we know it today came in fact from philosophy and the epistemology within it, and the metaphysics. Does this lead to wisdom and truth? NO - truth is the Lord in regard to all existences in the Universe. These are facts in life that you will find if and when you truly search - with an open mind - for the Truth. Is then structured and logic thinking in depth - wisdom? Is the thought based \u201cwisdom\u201d from the hindus or buddists philosophies - wisdom? Or even truth? Now, to be able and capable of judgements within this field you need to understand these matters first. You need to understand who God is in fact. And who God is not. What then comes from God - and what does in fact NOT come from God. Wisdom is considered (on the basis of the thoughts of Aristotle) to be a mixture of the theoretical knowledge (sophia) and the practical (phronesis) \u2026(Kant made the same distinction and deepened the thoughts in regard). And where the human being has integrated these parts into one solid ground/foundation within him/her self. So wisdom would then stand for: a capacity to have a sound judgment and conduct and at the same time a deep understanding of theoretical knowledge of the highest kind. But\u2026 real deep wisdom is something quite different in fact - even if and when a person has acquired the latter in the above mentioned manner- and (also) it is the \u201cfear of God\u201d. NOW, fear does not really mean the lexical definition of the word - but to be able and capable to understand the role we - being humans- have, and the Role of God in all that exists. Thereby act and think, accordingly. In all matters. ",

            "answer_text": "By definition, philo sophia is the love of wisdom. The prescribed method of doing this is to first study mathematics to learn logic, then to study the natural sciences to learn the laws of nature before studying philosophy. This is the path that took. I finished am stars in engineering before starting to study philosophy. Armed with logic, reason and the natural laws you are ready to start questioning, and uncovering rhetoric with the Socratic method. Pealing back the illogical rhetoric is what reveals wisdom. The first this I questioned as a philopsher was the current two-factor model for human behavior and disease. From a pure mathematical viewpoint, the statistics from all the identical twin studies ever done are not represented by two independent factor, but five are required to represent the statistics! The results are published in my paper entitled: Behavior Model Definition With this investigation, I discovered a particular behavior of modern science and the desperate need for philosophy. That is, when science is confronted with a result that they cannot explain, they often ignore the data. In my project Torn Between Two Worlds, I discuss other areas where science is failing because they are not willing to question and discover the wisdom that could result. The founders of science were also philosophers and the wisdom shines through today with theories that survived 2,500+ years. To put it dramatically, once can imagine a scholar of the young School of Athens paying a holiday visit to Abdera (with due caution to keep it secret from his Master), and on being received by the wise, far-travelled and world-famous old gentleman Democritus, asking him questions on the atoms, the shape of the earth, on moral conduct, God and the immortality of the soul \u2013 without being repudiated on any of these points.

            "answer_text": "Where can we find absolute TRUTH or \"true knowledge\"? Certainly not from mankind's flawed philosophies which change like the wind. Knowledge is knowing about something, but wisdom is understanding how that knowledge should be applied or used. It is safe to say that there is more knowledge in the world today than there has ever been. In fact, we are told that knowledge is increasing so rapidly that it doubles every other year. In spite of this fact, our world today is also marked by meaninglessness. There has never been a time in the history of the world when so many people were searching for purpose and meaning in their lives. How do you explain the above? Is it not explained by the fact that our world today is drowning in ever-increasing knowledge at the same time it is experiencing an ever-worsening draught of wisdom? Knowledge is outracing wisdom in our modern-day world. Consequently, men are coming to know more and more about less and less, while understanding less and less about more and more. While knowledge/truth may explain how brown cows eat green grass and give white milk that is turned into yellow butter, only wisdom can enlighten us to the meaning of life. Holy Scripture [EXCERPT] Now, there is a wisdom of this world, which should not be confused with the wisdom of God (1 Corinthians 1:18-25). \u201cThe wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. It never leads men to God nor to true wisdom, which alone reveals to us the true meaning of life. Instead, it only leads men to destruction; as King Solomon warned, \u201cThere is a way which seems right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death\u201d (Proverbs 14:12; 16:25). To the wisdom of this world, the preaching of the cross is foolishness. But to the wisdom that comes only from God, the preaching of the cross (Jesus\u2019 payment for everyone\u2019s sins) which is the central message of the \u201cHoly Scriptures,\u201d is the only thing that makes men \u201cwise unto salvation\u201d (2 Timothy 3:15).

            "answer_text": "The word philosophy itself means love of knowledge. Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the limits of all human knowledge. From the greek: Episteme(knowledge) logos (word/speech. Surely this can be claimed as one possible road to wisdom. However, the study of any of the branches of philosophy, and I suspect, many other disciplines can also lead to wisdom. I say this because I believe, as many others do that wisdom and knowledge are not interchangeable. One can acquire a great deal of knowledge and still completely lack wisdom. ( I probably fall somewhere along that line). Wisdom is how you use knowledge judiciously to better oneself, another, or the environment, or all three. Usually a difficult task, which is why wisdom is prized. Despite having a great deal of knowledge to bring to bear on any given problem, still, even very knowledgeable people fail the task. Truth is a subject also dealt with by epistemology or at least ultimate truth is,(Thanks Prof. French!) That truth being always the same regardless of context. Logic also touches on truth although truth more subjective or of varying degrees in one way or another. Here, I will bow to the special knowledge of those who study philosophy. I may be already out of my depth. I am still only a padawan. I answer only to keep philosophy fresh in my head. I hope you can use the info. ",

            "answer_text": "Understanding opposite ideas, in my opinion. Each is the hero and center of their own drama and the universe. But at the same time we figure in other dramas. - Which points to a fact that each is unique because the nodes of associations, circumstances, experiences, typologies and so on, is different. - Each entity and idea appears to be a \u201cjanus faced\u201d having opposite spins of the same abstract. - So to choose one philosophy over another, in my opinion, is a matter of choice and what is relative. But when we try to impose the philosophy upon others, whether it is a \u2018political ideology,\u2019 \u2018religious fanaticism,\u2019 or \u2018selfish bully,\u2019 etc, then there is something wrong with applying that philosophy at other\u2019s expense. - For example, whether it is religion, politics, economic systems, if one brand thinks it is the head and the other an a$$ and proclaims it has no need of them, then how is the body truly a love of wisdom? - Or what if one proclaims, \u201cMy God is better than your God,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll show YOU whose God is GOD!\u201d then where is the \u201clove of wisdom\u201d? - If we consider that philosophy, used as a methodology, there are certain fundamental questions. One is \u201cWhat is the nature of God?\u201d - From that perspective, we must define what is God. If \u201cGod\u201d is \u201cThe Supreme Being,\u201d then there is one God. If \u201cGod\u201d is \u201ca Supreme Being\u201d then there are many \u201cGods.\u201d - That means that if human beings agree that \u201cGod is The Supreme Being,\u201d than our methodology can differentiate between the \u201cConcept of God\u201d being \u201cOne God,\u201d and the differences in religion that all have sacred teachings and dogmas, are acknowledging the same God. Whereas if the concept of \u201cGod,\u201d is \u201cA supreme being,\u201d then the religions have an inherent problem because they are teaching ways to turn people against each other. - So, the question comes in, \u201cWhat is the methodology for philosophy\u201d that would lead to the truth about the Nature of God and the human beings so that they likewise become \u201cOne with the Holy Invisible Spirit,\u201d versus \u201cHow can the philosophy divide humans by having more than one Supreme being?\u201d This is my opinion, but I am sure others have more.

Ideology and rhetoric are the terrible twins of language and politics. They seduce with their simplistic \u2018truths\u2019 and inveigle themselves into our very sense of identity. We become the message. And in so doing we validate those who would hold sway over us. Read history for proof of this, especially the 20th century. And then study the present. Philosophers question everything. And in their application of the method first devised by Socrates, they unceasingly search for the truths which inform the human condition, and its potential. No ideology or rhetoric can survive the simple question \u2018why?\u2019 We must be rigorous in asking this question of everything, especially of those who would present us with their utopia, their truth, their \u2018final solutions\u2019. Philosophers are the sworn enemy of demagogues, stupidity, lazy thinking, assumptions, beliefs, and ignorance. Philosophy is high-level thinking; the reserve of those with the intellectual tools, mental agility, and strength of mind to critically question what you might take as given but is, in fact, merely your illusion.

As you question yourself more and more, you\u2019ll realize that much of what you think you know is really sort of arbitrary. Eventually you\u2019ll ask yourself, what do I actually know for real? And you\u2019ll start building up your own philosophy of life \u2014 what\u2019s good, what\u2019s true, what\u2019s honorable, what\u2019s real, etc. \u2014 from the ground up. ",

Philosophy construed this way aims at impeccably clear forms of thought and argument, and by doing so can generate philosophical insights, which can be of value for better understanding our human reality.

Wisdom is the goal, not truth. It seems wrong, but that is because you are thinking in terms of right and wrong, not philosophically (where the existence of right and wrong are disputed). Sadly, nothing will ever irrefutably lead you to truth, and philosophy is all about refuted beliefs. ",
