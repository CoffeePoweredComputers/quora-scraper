            "answer_text": "Is conversational hypnosis pseudoscience? It\u2019s hard to say - even though: 1 - I\u2019m trained in the sciences (to at least Ph. D. level) 2 - I\u2019ve taught conversational Hypnosis and written a book on the subject Why? Because pseudoscience is a very specific thing: Pseudoscience consists of claims, beliefs, or practices presented as being plausible scientifically, but which are not justifiable by the scientific method. A topic, practice, or body of knowledge can reasonably be considered pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the norms of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms. [ref: Wikipedia] In othe words, the claims must be such that they can be examined by the scientific method and the topic or practice must fail to meet the norms of scientific research. Without going into the entire rigorous process of correctly executed scientific method (or this would be a very long Answer!) think about which parts of conversational hypnosis we would examine first. For example, good science values reproducibility - can we hypnotise the same person (or members of a representatively similar population) with the same method every time (or a high enough proportion of the time to be within acceptable norms)? For a flexible feedback-driven process like hypnosis, exacting reproducibility is an issue. So there would have to be an experiment (or experiments) which account for this factor. It\u2019s difficult to figure out what the acceptable parameters would be before the scientific community states \u201cthe existence and efficacy of conversational hypnosis is a scientific fact, folks.\u201d Yes, science requires a consensus - not everyone agrees, some scientists have an agenda or have an axe to grind, while others may have a vested interest for or against. (who is going to fund this research, after all?) Overall: I\u2019d say the question is irrelevant, so long as the jury is still out and while those who do/teach conversational hypnosis does not make any scientific claims about it. ",

            "answer_text": "If you're asking is it like crystal healing or astrology, no it is not. It really does exist.  It's also not some magical word play by which you bring someone under a compulsive spell to do your bidding.  Several factors are at work and it's hoped the interplay of them makes it more likely that the subject will behave more in a manner you desire. It doesn't always work, and like some things, the lower you set your goals and expectations is the more likely they'll be met. It's also possible that false credit is given to a conversational hypnosis than it was actually due.  Primary factors include building rapport with the subject, getting in sync with them (and them with you) by mirroring their actions until you can lead theirs, priming various thoughts by seeding key words, application of tone, inflection, and gestures, relying on social norms, relying on psychological behaviors and responses, anchoring emotions to touches or objects, and confusion and ambiguity.  A subject needs to feel comfortable in order to  take suggestions. Tell a stranger to sit, they may be offended at your pushiness. Chat a moment and say \"please have a seat\" and they likely will. Keep them in interesting conversation, and a subtle eye glance or mere head nod invites them to join you. All of these are suggestions, knowing what and when can guide your subject to do what you'd like.  If you outright mimic someone, it's comes across as creepy. But if you delay it, and are smooth in your transitions, it can start to build a bond, express deeper interest and connectivity, and often be used to lead their actions. Much like how a yawn can be infectious.  Priming is used to trigger connective thoughts. If I say grey and animal, you are already thinking of an elephant; more so if I just used the word trunk in the prior sentence when I was supposedly talking about luggage. If I say the colors red, white, and blue you may be drawn to the image of an American flag. If I change the order, perhaps less so. If I do blue, white, and red and you happen to be French, then the same words conjure a different flag. Figuring out the context and experiences of the subject are key. Using positive imagery and uplifting phrases while talking will most likely induce feelings of happiness. Conversational hypnotists will exploit those feelings because the subject is feeling them but isn't attributing them to why. (It's like taking your first date on an exhilarating roller coaster; she'll remember the excitement days later, more than likely attributing it to you and the date more than te ride, as the adrenaline rush lasts long after the ride is over.) Tone, inflection, and gesture can convey much more than mere words in a conversation. Facial expressions too. Give someone subtle approval and attention when they do what you want, and disinterest and lack of attention when they go off track. Their own desire for acceptance and validation of self-worth can be used to steer their behavior toward what's desired. Yes, conversational hypnotism uses emotional manipulation.  Social norms, like accepting a handshake or returning a smile, can start the snowball rolling. Leading questions or asking someone something about themselves can get a conversation rolling, where you don't even have to care or listen, just find pivot points to change direction or interrupt.  Psychological factors like wanting to help someone out, or having increased trust in someone after dong them a favor, certainly amplify the experience. We all behave in predictable ways and are compliant in auto-pilot mode. If someone says, \"here hold thus a second,\" most likely you will before finding out what it is or possibly knowing who it is. You are more likely to if someone has rapport pre-built. Interesting things then happen if that person says thank you, as you just did them an unexpected favor. More interesting things happen if they don't ask for the object back or wait well more than your expected \"just a second\" duration.  Anchoring relies on our brains being pattern matchers, especially with stimulus. If you touch someone's arm in a subtle but socially appropriate way each time they smile, laugh, express joy, and so forth their brain builds a relationship between that sensation and that stimulus. Then if you later touch their arm the same way, the subject recalls the same emotions (maybe more subdued). Such techniques can be used to subtly reward (or punish) the subject towards compliance.  Confusion is also used; you see it with politicians that start off with some point, then ramble with nonsense and the mind has no clue what's being said. Then they suddenly wrap up with a strong clear point and 'vote for me.' And the mind latches onto the only thing that makes sense. These mental drifting moments are also opportunities, not guarantees, for momentary suggestibility.  Conversational hypnosis brings together a lot of different fields and techniques, playing the odds, pushing subjects toward a desired outcome. It's not always effective, but works more than you might think.  It is by far not a science, but it isn't fictional either.   ",
