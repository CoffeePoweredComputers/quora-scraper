            "answer_text": "Not always! when you get a disease - means getting clinical symptom that means either your body is fighting back or they lost the fight. Disease can be veracious type - may be broadly classified in two pathogenic or genetic/metabolic. Now if it is pathogenic- means if there is some type of foreign organism/ virus causing the same then most of the time they also ensure that they can replicate/ divide along with the cell/ tissue etc. Thus new cells are also with pathogen! Most of the Virus/ bacteria use this trick to hack our system. If it is genetically then the particular cell /tissue is expressing some altered genetic code which is also replicating; dividing with cells until cells repair system repair it back to track. Most of the time our repair system work well to stop dividing the those infected/ mutated cells but some time it is not possible to control the situation. ",

            "answer_text": "Your assumption is only correct if there is an inborn error or a mutational event that creates continuous diseased cells. Otherwise, normal cells can be affected by various insults, from viruses to cancers, which act on these normal cells to create pathologic changes. Hence, \u2018new\u2019 cells - which by the way are NOT \u2018forming every moment\u2019 - may or may not be diseased, depending on whether there is a congenital error, a mutation, or the effect of external pathologic mechanisms on specific organ cells.
