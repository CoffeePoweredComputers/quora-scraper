            "answer_text": "As someone who studied several religions, including the ones mentioned above, I think that I can give you an informed answer. (No religious opinion will be added here) According to several texts Moses comes prior to Jesus, henceforth the elimination of the later would have no consequence on the first. About Mohammed, it can be a more tricky answer, since Christianity (to some extent) is mentioned in the Quran. Taking that into consideration, one would assume that Mohammed either knew or met Jesus or heard of him. That leaves out two options: either Mohammed co-existed with Jesus, or he came to be afterwards. If we use the first option, then removing Jesus would be of no effect on Mohammed, but if we use the second option, yes, removing Jesus would also mean removing Mohammed. For the Jewish people, who do not consider Jesus as the real messiah, removing him would have no effect in their beliefs and religion. True, the tree biggest religions are related to each other through Abraham. However, there is more religions than these three in existence. Just to name a few: HinduismShamanismShintoismBudhismPaganismTo these religions and several others in existence, the removal of Jesus would have no effect on their beliefs and religion. However, taking into consideration society as a whole in today's world, it's highly unlikely that both the imagery, existence and influence of Jesus can or will be eliminated. Meaning that getting rid of Jesus is pretty much impossible since it's deeply embedded in humanity's History, morals and social values, even if some people don't believe in the man that Jesus was or what he represents.

            "answer_text": "IF the world gets rid of Jesus Christ, then don't they have to get rid of Mohammed and Moses too? Isn't all that stuff connected? Doesn't getting rid of Jesus make all beliefs a lie? You can get rid of Jesus without getting rid of Moses. Moses is chronologically (and theologically) prior.All \u201cthat stuff\u201d (the Abrahamic religions) is indeed connected. They all came each from the previous one.Getting rid of Jesus does not make all beliefs a lie. There are a few thousand religions other than the Abrahamic ones. Shintoism and Hinduism, both quite prior to Christianity, can exist without a Jesus even existing, and would exist if all humanity suddenly went sane and got rid of all bibles. They have nothing to do with Jesus, and they are just 2 of literally thousands.In short, please expand your knowledge a bit before asking with so many assumptions. It doesn\u2019t make you look good.
