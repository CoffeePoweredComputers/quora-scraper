            "answer_text": "No. And it\u2019s unlikely (though not impossible) that one will ever be discovered. First of all, nothing is 100% confirmed in science. Everything has some uncertainty and error bars, and every observation can have multiple interpretations. Even then the evidence for once hypothesis is overwhelming, it can never reach 100%. This is all doubly true when modeling exoplanets. If we\u2019re lucky, we can measure both the mass and radius of a planet, as well as figuring out how much irradiation it\u2019s getting from its sun. If the irradiation is enough to keep the planet\u2019s surface between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius, we conclude that the planet could potentially have liquid water on its surface. Such planets are categorized as potentially habitable exoplanets (for life \u201cas we know it\u201d). These planets might only have small puddles of water, or they might be completely covered by a planet-wide ocean. Currently we can\u2019t tell the difference, however this may change in the not-too-distant future, perhaps with the help of the James Webb Space Telescope. But one thing is for sure \u2014 it\u2019s very unlikely that there exists a pure liquid-water planet, which is liquid all the way through. To understand why, look at the water phase diagram below. Notice how above a few 100 GPa, which is the typical pressures at the core of Earth-like planets, water becomes a solid. You would need to heat up the water to thousands of degrees to melt this ultra-high-pressure ice. Earth\u2019s core is hot because of radioactive decay and planetary differentiation, neither of which would happen in a pure-water world.  However, if nevertheless the water world core somehow acquires enough latent heat to melt the ice (see the temperature profile for Earth below), the core would still not become \u201cnormal\u201d liquid water, but rather a very strange form of supercritical water. This this form of water would have both liquid and gaseous properties, and would also have very different chemical properties.   ",

And (1) I do not believe that such a situation is in any way possible, as any stellar nebula would have at least some dust in it, so there would have to be a rocky core, and (2) Since no such planet exists in our own Solar System, discovering that a planet exists that is even close to being such an object would require that we have the ability to explore its planetary system in as much or more detail than we have explored our own, which means that we are at least a millennium and probably more like a million years from having both the means and the money to enable and pay for a sufficiently extensive search.
