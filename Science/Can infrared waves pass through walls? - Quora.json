            "answer_text": "In general, no, though there are circumstances where they could, if you\u2019re willing to play a bit with your definition of either \u2018infrared\u2019 or \u2018wall\u2019. If you had a wall made of normal building materials - wood studs, sheetrock, and the like, then they are going to be pretty much opaque in the IR as well. There are even things that are clear in the visible range that are opaque in the deeper IR. You\u2019ll often see laser cutters, for instance, that use CO2 lasers (10.1 micron wavelength), where the safety box around the cutter has a lid made of Plexiglass. At the cutter wavelength, it\u2019s completely opaque, so there is no worry of someone getting hurt, even though you can see through the lid and watch cut-lines appear in your piece. Other materials work the opposite way, like some semiconductors. Gallium Arsenide or Silicon are opaque to the human eye, but transparent in the IR, since the IR photons are weaker than the band-gap energy of the semiconductor. By and large, the Special Effects depicting false-color detailed images of people taken through rooftops or walls has a lot of science working against it, starting with the radiated heat of a person creating an outline-shaped image on a wall that then travels through sheetrock in real time. The temperature difference is tiny, the sheetrock is not a good heat conductor, which adds to the heat traveling, at best, very very slowly through a wall. If you look closely at ads for, say, an IR camera to attach to your smartphone, it\u2019ll show how you can tell that there\u2019s a hot water pipe behind the wall by the warm line on the wall. What\u2019s not shown is what happens if you stop flowing water through the pipe. The picture looks the same for the next 20 minutes. Not really high rez. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cCan infrared penetrate walls?\u201d No, it cannot. All common building materials in the usual thickness used to build walls are completely opaque and sometimes reflecting in all IR wavelengths. Many people got it wrong from movies. Far infrared used by thermal imagers is even more problematic: basically ALL material are opaque at this wavelength. There are very few lens material options for thermal imagers working with room temperature objects, Germanium being the most popular for commercial thermal imagers. Some plastics also work. Terahertz / millimeter waves have a better penetration and can \u201csee\u201d through up to 1\u20132cm thickness of many materials, but their resolution is low. To see through walls, even longer wavelengths are needed, at least in the microwave range. Their resolution is extremely bad, sophisticated AI is needed to render a rudimentary image from the interference artifacts, and even in that it\u2019s difficult to tell apart a human and a potted plant. It\u2019s not really a technology limitation, it\u2019s physics. ",

At the far side, they re-emit IR based on their emisivity. ",
