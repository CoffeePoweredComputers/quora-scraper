            "answer_text": "Can you explain religion with science? Science can be used to investigate anything in the material world and universe. Alan Appleby's answer to Can ideas and belief systems evolve through natural selection and mutations? Yes! Ideas evolve in cultures with diversity and branching, in a similar way to speciation in living organisms. This is particularly noticeable in ideologies and religions. Just think of all the branches of Christianity and Islam, to name but two. This sort of cultural evolution of ideas and beliefs is known as Memetics. It is an analogy from the biological term \u201cgenetics\u201d. Then there is the neuroscience and psychology of actual belief. Alan Appleby's answer to What scientific discovery would make all religions obsolete? What scientific discovery would make all religions obsolete? - Neuroscientists confirming that gods are god-delusions in human brains, would be the positive confirmation of gods being imaginary projections from indoctrinated brains on to the external reality, where they conflict with scientific evidence, or seek out gaps or obfuscating smoke, in which to hide their illusory nature. There are brain functions and areas of the brain related to religious experiences, which science can investigate. Alan Appleby's answer to If science cannot prove the existence of God, can science create a God? With advances in neuroscience and improved brain scanning technology, science can probably positively identify and map god-delusions in the very near future. Particularly as it can already identify various psychotic delusions, and illusions and delusions induced by medical conditions such as epilepsy. Alan Appleby's answer to How would an atheist explain the conversion of St Paul? His visions, falling, and sudden conversion, sound very like an account of A DISEASE ONCE THOUGHT SACRED in ancient times. DISEASE ONCE SACRED. A HISTORY OF THE MEDICAL UNDERSTANDING OF EPILEPSY The idea that epilepsy is a supernatural, demonic or spiritual disorder persisted with widespread beliefs that it was due to possession by the devil, Epilepsy Linked to Intense Religious and Spiritual Experiences, Like Seeing God Seizures involve areas of the brain linked to religious and spiritual processes, Missouri University researchers found. Nearly a year ago, scientists at Hadassah Hebrew Hospital in Jerusalem were carrying out tests on a 46-year-old man with temporal lobe epilepsy, when he began chanting prayers. He then got up and marched around the hospital, telling people, \"God has sent me to you.\" Readings from an electroencephalogram revealed a spike in activity in his left prefrontal cortex, which has been linked to religious experiences, just prior to the incident. Indeed, epileptic patients have been known to report detailed religious experiences, and numerous studies on the topic suggest that spiritual processes can change with different neurological conditions. There is evidence of certain types of brain damage increasing fundamentalist thinking. Alan Appleby's answer to What are your thoughts on the recent scientific research which shows a strong correlation between religious fundamentalism and brain damage? Study uncovers how brain damage increases religious fundamentalism  (Photo credit: National Institute of Mental Health) Research has found religious belief is associated with certain regions of the human brain, but there is still much to learn about how these areas influence religious belief. A new study in the journal Neuropsychologia found that lesions in a particular brain region tend to increase religious fundamentalism. Grafman and his colleagues examined male Vietnam combat veterans with lesions to part of the brain known as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. They found veterans with these lesions reported higher levels of religious fundamentalism compared to those without the lesions. The new study found damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex appeared to cause an increase in religious fundamentalism by reducing cognitive flexibility \u2013 meaning the ability to update our beliefs in light of new evidence \u2013 along with lowering the personality trait of openness.

            "answer_text": "Perhaps the science of psychology, if psychology might be called a science, gives some clues.It is found that children at a young age see the whole world as animated. Stones, trees, houses are viewed as having feelings can be hurt. Children communicate with these objects. The step deities is not far away.There are occurrences in life that have an impact. Rain, wind, hot weather, cold weather. These come and go and it is not possible to interfere with the weather. But people can learn to read the signs and predict the weather. When bad weather is expected and some one wished it would not happen and it did not happen this person might think that he had some power to change the weather. From here one sees the development of rituals, and sacrifices to have influence on the powers behind the weather. It was also not difficult to see the congruency between breathing and wind. The God of the Israelites started as a wind god. And in the second creation myth God breaths the soul in his creation. Early religions were focused on trying to favour the Gods. In the Homeric poems we see that the people pour some wine on the floor for the Gods before they drink. Afterlife. It is a well known phenomenon that people have visual and auditory hallucinations of deceased persons in the early days after the passing away. This might support the idea that the deceased person is still present in some way. The science of sociology might explain the existence of organised religion. Of course the sciences do not support the content of the religious ideas. The sciences look at phenomena of religious behaviour and religious thoughts and emotions. The sciences do not support the truth within a religion. ",

            "answer_text": "Can you explain religion with science? I think you can explain religious belief and religious behaviour (to a certain extent) with a natural explanation. Which natural explanation might be more likely is another matter - people are complicated. My preferred explanation (and one that is a person choice not informed by specialist education or training in the field, just something that seems likely to me) is that humans have evolved to prefer Type I errors (imagining something is there when it is not) over Type II errors (thinking that something isn\u2019t there when it is). The example being ancient hunters walking through the bush and seeing some movement up ahead in the bushes. Those hunters that reacted as though the moving bushes contained a tiger and ran away, lived to pass on that careful nature even if there was tiger in those bushes or not. On the other hand, those hunters that reacted as thought there was no need to worry about the moving bushes that actually did contain a tiger got eaten and did not pass on their \u201ccarefree\u201d nature. Extrapolate that to all the other phenomenon encountered; thunder and lightning goes away whether you pray or not, but the careful hunters will always pray anyway because they are wired to be careful and assume that something is behind the thunder. And the earthquakes and the floods and all the other things that gods are held responsible for. ",

            "answer_text": " I took this precis from here:The Believing Brain Synthesizing thirty years of research, psychologist and science historian, Michael Shermer upends the traditional thinking about how humans form beliefs about the world. Simply put, beliefs come first and explanations for beliefs follow. The brain, Shermer argues, is a belief engine. Using sensory data that flow in through the senses, the brain naturally looks for and finds patterns - and then infuses those patterns with meaning, forming beliefs. Once beliefs are formed, our brains subconsciously seek out confirmatory evidence in support of those beliefs, which accelerates the process of reinforcing them, and round and round the process goes in a positive-feedback loop. In The Believing Brain, Shermer provides countless real-world examples of how this process operates, from politics, economics, and religion to conspiracy theories, the supernatural, and the paranormal. Ultimately, he demonstrates why science is the best tool ever devised to determine whether or not our belief matches reality. There are links to reader reviews on the page also. A jolly good 4 or 5 hour read. ",
