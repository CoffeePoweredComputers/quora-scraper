            "answer_text": "Density is a relation of two quantities. \u201cX per y\u201d. As such, the question lacks specificity. In any case you simply measure both x and y, and then divide x by y: The \u201cy\u201d is usually volume. To measure the volume of an irregular object, you put it in a tub of water and measure how much water it displaces. This was Archimedes\u2019 famous \u201cEureka!\u201d moment: since two objects cannot occupy the same space, occupied volume must equal displaced volume. then if you were talking about e.g. \"Mass density\u201d, you\u2019d put it on a scale , that's x, divide by y = displaced water. EDIT: note the word \u201cdisplaced\u201d. This is EXACTLY the right word! Look it up: it means that a thing not being able to go in place x, must be put in some other place y. So you see the moment you institute the rule \u201cno two volumes can occupy the same space\u201d, it immediately follows that there is some y with the same volume of x. i suspect there is some exact Latin equivalent to the word \u201cdisplace\u201d, and when that word entered Archimedes\u2019 mind In that way, the rest, as they say, is history.

            "answer_text": "Lets start with the basic idea.\"molecular density\" is the number of molecules packed into a certain volume.Quantitatively this would be: \"Molecular density\" = \"number of Molecules\" divided by \"Volume occupied\" We can use this feature to compare relative densities of matter. Say we packed 1,000,000 molecules into a cubic metre, its density would be: 1,000,000 m-3 (we have no defined units for # of molecules) Then say we packed 2,000,000 molecules into half a cubic metre, its density would be:4,000,000 m-3  From this we can conclude our second group of molecules is four times as dense as our first. Chemists ad Physicists have further defined quantities such as the mole and Avagadros number to standardize many density/quantity problems however that is a lesson for another day :) (you can find much of this information online) ",
