Umbrella is mounted to a tripod and the light will be facing towards umbrella's inner curvature.steadily towards the centre of the umbrella .\u201cCatchlight: Light that reflects in a subject\u2019s eyes and adds life to the portrait.

            "answer_text": "It is used to soften the effect of flash. To provide proper lighting to the subject and the surroundings, flash lights are used. Since using the flashlight directly often leads to intense and unnatural light, it is not recommended, at least not for professional photos. To make the light from the flash seem mkre natural, less intense and evenly distributed, photographers use umbrellas as the translucent stuff they're made of allow the light to pass in a way that it meets the above criteria. Apart from this, umbrellas can also help in directing light in specific directions like for when  you want to light a particular side of face. ",
