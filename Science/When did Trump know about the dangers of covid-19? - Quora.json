            "answer_text": "The answer to this question isn't as clear cut as it seems. I could as you \u201cWhen did you know about the dangers of the Bubonic Plague\u201d? If you were being honest, you would probably say something to the effect of when certain information was brought to your attention, maybe in school or during a TV broadcast. Maybe a friend or parent told you years ago. So, if you and your family went on a trip somewhere and two of you contracted the Bubonic Plague I could ask you \u201cWhen did you know the black plague was deadly and could possibly kill you?\u201d To which you might reply, \u201cwell I've known of the black death for years and how deadly it can be, but I had no idea my family was at real risk\u201d It's all about signals to noise ratio. Oft times after a disaster, after \u201cthe incident\u201d has had experts pour over data, look over every little detail and examine various timelines, mistakes will be identified. After 9/11 it was revealed that there were tons of red flags that something big was about to happen, but the people in charge somehow missed them. Same goes for the Oklahoma City bombing, Air France flight 447, the Space Shuttle Challenger and every industrial disaster you can think of. Lots of noise, and often the signals don't get through, and of course what they say is true, hindsight is 20/20. So did Trump know about Covid-19? Yes. Did he know about it early? Yes. Did he and his advisors think it was a serious threat? No. And in case you're thinking I'm letting Trump off the hook, various leaders of all stripes, including Democrats and leaders of other countries such as Italy, Spain, France and the UK all misjudged the severity of the virus. So when this is all over there will be all kinds of expose's written about who knew what and when. But the truth is, you and I wouldn't have done any better. The only thing that will matter, is when he/they realized that their countrys were in serious trouble, how did they act? That's all that will matter in the end. ",

            "answer_text": "When did Trump know about the dangers of covid-19? Earliest reports of the briefings were from late November. Some note December. Security agencies had been watching the unfolding of the disease as early as September or October, but briefing the president occurred after it was determined that it could be a problem. However, Trump, in his \u201cinfinite wisdom\u201d chose to ignore the reports until the disease was full-blown in February. By then, it was too late to curtail the spread. Trump further ensured the disaster by declaring the disease a \u201choax.\u201d We were doomed at that point. He guaranteed that America would suffer terribly for his hubris. 40,000 people are now DEAD because of his lies and apathy. ",
