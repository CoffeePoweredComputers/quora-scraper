            "answer_text": "You ask: \u201cWhy are measurements important?\u201d What gets measured gets fixed. One of my engineer friends gave me that mantra, and as life has happened I have seen the truth in it. On the other hand, I believe it was Stephen Covey who said: It doesn't matter how fast you climb if the ladder's against the wrong wall. More analytically, I see measurement primarily as a tool for comparison - that is, measurement is useless in a vacuum. In fact, I guess measurement is, by definition, a comparison - of that which is measured to a standard (e.g., \u201chow many meters\u201d compares x to the standard length of the meter). More frequently, two similar phenomena are compared by first comparing each to the standard: Is it farther to Chicago or to Dallas?Is the distance to my destination more or less than my maximum daily travel rate?Is Mary taller than Sue?Is Sue tall enough to ride the roller coaster?How many miles did we cycle this week?At that rate, will we reach our destination by next Thursday?How many tons will the steel beam support?How many tons does the bridge structure weigh?Sometimes, however, we become obsessed with measurement - particularly objective measurement - to our detriment. There are sometimes important attributes or characteristics that are difficult to measure or quantify but which have a greater relationship to the outcome than characteristics or attributes that are easily measured. If Mary spent 40 hours creating a painting and Sue spent 100 hours creating another, which is the better painting? It is important - nay, critical - that the greatest effort in measurement be devoted to determining and measuring the characteristics or attributes most important to the desired outcome. (I've never been convinced that a high score on a multiple-choice test measures anything other than the ability to take multiple choice test.) ",

            "answer_text": "Though the question seems to have very obvious answer.. here is some explanation as it also has scientific and technical aspect: measurements are there to provide means for either comparing 2 or more entities (may be physical or logical) or secondly to indicate the exact quantity of any entity\u2026. something is greater/smaller/brighter/farther/heavier/lighter/faster than something but by what amount.. there must be some standard scale for all these entities.Moon is at very larger distance from earth but exactly how much. I need to buy some quantity of food, wheat and grains from shop keeper, but again what quantity.. (especially while you are ordering through telephone\u2026 Imagine what will happen if you don\u2019t have measurements like gram, mili-gram, kilogram, pounds\u2026 etc).Few lines from wikipedia : Measurement is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event, which can be compared with other objects or events. Measurement is a cornerstone of trade, science, technology, and quantitative research in many disciplines. Historically, many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern International System of Units (SI). This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology.
