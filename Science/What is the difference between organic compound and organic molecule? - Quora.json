            "answer_text": "It is the same as the difference between any compound and its molecule: A compound is a substance consisting of identical basic units, the molecules, which in turn are the smallest parts into which the compound can be divided by physical methods. Physical methods, in this context, are procedures that do not cause any chemical bonds to be either broken or made. Example: You can smell ethanol if you put your nose close to a surface of liquid ethanol, because through evaporation, some molecules of ethanol become airborne and as such enter your nose and react with the specific cells that can detect the presence of ethanol molecules. Evaporation is therefore a physical process. If you put fire to the same as above mixture of air and ethanol molecules, those molecules of ethanol will burn, and new molecules, of carbon dioxide and water will form, so that the chemical bonds holding the molecule of ethanol together will brake and new chemical bonds between carbon and oxygen as well as between hydrogen and oxygen will form. Burning is therefore a chemical process. ",

            "answer_text": "A molecule is the smallest unit (particle) of an organic compound. For example, ethanol is an organic compound that consists of ethanol molecules (CH3-CH2-OH). Ethanol is the alcohol that you find in alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, vodka. A small sample of ethanol would contain billions and billions of ethanol molecules. All organic compounds consist of particles called organic molecules. ",
