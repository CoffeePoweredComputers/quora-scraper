            "answer_text": "Spacetime singularities should have \u201cinfinite gravity\u201d and are assumed to exist somewhere inside black holes but\u2026 they are not things we can observe or reliably compute. Henceforth I assume we do not speak about singularities, only of observable space up to the hole\u2019s event horizon. Then, depends on a quantitative approach to  \u201cstrength of the gravity\u201d. If we estimate the gravity potential, then yes, we can think of it as of infinite. Namely, falling objects experience unlimited redshift, time dilation in the stationary reference frame also becomes infinite at the event horizon, and we need very much energy to pull a fixed-mass particle (such as electron or proton) out of the hole from the vicinity of the horizon; eventually infinite amount when we want to pull something from the horizon itself. If we estimate the gravity force, then the answer depends on how do we measure gravity near the horizon (remember: the concept of force, especially the gravity force, depends on reference frames). If we measure the tidal force on a free-falling object, then it will not rise to infinity before the object became silent for us, external observers. When falling object crossed the horizon, the tidal force shall be finite and inversely proportional to the size of the hole. So, a supermassive black hole can swallow a space probe that could pass through the horizon undamaged (but, sadly, it will not able to transmit anything to the Earth then). Contrary, a presumed rigid cable dangling (not falling) to a hole towards the horizon will experience gravity force tending to infinity. Again, the reference frames stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "No. At the core of a black hole, gravity is vastly strong, but not infinite, because there is no singularity there. The Uncertainty Principle does not allow particles to be confined in regions smaller than their wavelengths. Edward Cherlin's answer to Can a black hole really have zero volume? Gravity is proportional to mass, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance. A star collapsing to a black hole may lose some mass to an accretion disk and polar jets. Its radius decreases from hundreds of thousands or millions of kilometers to something smaller than an atom, a factor of perhaps 10191019, so the gravitational force at the core should increase by 10381038 or so from the surface gravity of the original star. (A full General Relativity treatment would produce corrections that we can ignore in this very rough approximation.) Within the event horizon, gravity is so strong that light cannot escape, indeed, cannot travel upward at all. But it is not infinite. Infalling matter is not accelerated instantly to the speed of light. Black holes have the same external gravity as the masses that formed them, such as a collapsing star. ",
