            "answer_text": "Pneumatic trucks/tanks are for dry bulk such as sand or silica or plastic pellets. They use air pressure from the top pressing down and combination of air pressure and velocity through a belly tube to force the product out and into an unloading line. Pressure gets too high on either side and the unloading line or belly tube will stop up and then you've got a mess. You have to know what you're doing and be on your toes watching the gauges. ",

            "answer_text": "well I answered a similar question to this a while back, but was advised that I was incorrect in my assumption. To the best of my knowledge, a pneumatic truck (trailer) is a bulk trailer that somehow uses air pressure to force the bulk product into or out of the trailer. As for how they work, you\u2019ll have to ask someone who knows more than I do, but I think that\u2019s what a pneumatic trailer is. ",
