            "answer_text": "Hi, I will try to explain this with two sets of examples: Suppose, three persons are attending a written exam to get a job (only one position available) . The minimum qualifying marks is 50 out of 100 and the criteria for getting a job is who ever scores the highest will get the job. Person 1 gets 35 marks, Person 2 gets 60 marks and Person 3 gets 90 marks. Here, the result is the marks obtained by each of them. Whereas, conclusion is person2 and 3 have qualified but only person 3 has fulfilled all the criteria and hence he gets the job.Similarly, in a scientific experiment, for example you are performing a chemical reaction. Your objective is react Chemical X with Chemical Y to get Chemical Z. You have reacted X with Y but you got W as product. Here, your result is W whereas, your conclusion is Z cannot be formed by reacting X and Y together.Cheers!!! ",
