            "answer_text": "No. Not at all, if your aspect is column by column then element after bismuth is oxygen and O18 isotope of oxygen is radioactive and not entire element oxygen. Now, if we consider row aspect element after bismuth is polonium and after that arsenic, I know they both are radioactive,just like them Radon is also radioactive, so your thought is right only if you consider row aspect, but not in the case of column aspect. Hope my opinion is right and it is better if it helps you. Thank you for asking your doubt. ",
