            "answer_text": "You CANNOT liquify light gases as O2, N2 (the main components of air) or other such as CH4 by compression at room temperature. Their critical temperatures are very low (cryogenic, e.g.: lower than -100 \u00baC for oxygen, close to -150 \u00baC for nitrogen), which means that they are at a \u201csupercritical\u201d state at ambient temperature. In turn, that means essentially there is no liquid; no matter how high you compress them, liquid doesn\u2019t appear and you get only a denser gas. (This is used for instance for using natural gas in vehicles; it is compressed greatly, up to 300 bar, to get more density and then less volume.) For comparison, other gases can be liquified by compression. For instance, steam, water vapor or vapor of H2O has a critical temperature of almost 380 \u00baC. This means of course that it is liquid at ambient conditions. To be a vapor, pressure must be either a vacuum or the partial pressure within a very diluted mixture (e.g., air saturated with steam has less than 2 % weight of it). Another example is liquified petroleum gases (LPG), propane and butane. Their critical temperatures are in the range of 100 \u00baC. At ambient temperature, you can get them liquid by applying moderate pressures, in the order of 10s of bar. That\u2019s why they call them \u201cliquified\u201d. ",
