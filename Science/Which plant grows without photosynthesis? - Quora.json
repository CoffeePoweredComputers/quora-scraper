            "answer_text": "The only plants which grow without photosynthesis are two groups called parasites and saprophytes. Parasites obtain nutrition from the living cells of another plant host, one example being a flowering plant, dodder (Cuscutea). Dodder is a very thin vine, transluscent yellow to orange that grows from seeds, but immediately catches onto almost any species of plant nearby, forming peg-like structures called haustoria which serve as tubes to suck the sap from the host. Dodder sends tendrils from the main vine and becomes like a web, entangling the whole plant. The flowers are tiny - 2\u20134 mm, but produce large quantities of nearly invisible seeds that can lie dormant in soil for years. Dodder can grow on wild plants, but can invade and destroy certain crops such as alfalfa. Another parasite is mistletoe, but it is slow growing, often on trees, and generally does not cause much damage. Saprophytes grow entirely on dead organic matter. Most of them are fungi including molds, mildews, and mushrooms. Mushroom are important commercial crops which take advantage of the fact that they need no sunlight since photosynthesis does not take place. They are grown in trays of humus which can be stacked high, taking up little space, and in low light. Indian pipe (Monotropa uniflora) is an example of a flowering plant which has no chlorophyll. It has a fully formed flower with petals and a stem with leaves, but the whole plant is white. I grows in deep woods where little light reaches the forest floor.  ",

Those two are very unique plant specimen that could be easily found in continental forests of Europe (Croatia). Lathrea squamaria L. - Common Toothworth  (Photo: J\u00f6rg Hempel) I, J\u00f6rg Hempel [CC BY-SA 2.0 de (Creative Commons - Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Germany - CC BY-SA 2.0 DE)], via Wikimedia Commons It has not chlorophyll. L. squamaria lives as a parasite sucking nutrients from the host plant using specific nodules (haustoria) on its rhizome.  Neottia nidus-avis (L.) Rich. - Bird's-nest Orchid Only seemingly similar to Lathrea squamaria is another non-photosynthetic plant: Neottia nidus-avis. Actually, those two are not similar at all despite the fact they look quite similar and they are both without chlorophyll. They differ in the way they get nutrients. While L. squamaria is the only parasitic member of the Scrophulariaceae family, the N. nidus-avis is a kind of orchid (fam. Orchydaceae) who gets nutrients as a saprophyte throughout the mycorrhizal symbiosis with a fungus.  (Photo: Franz Xaver) ",
