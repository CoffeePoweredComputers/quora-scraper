            "answer_text": "Photons do have gravitational pull. If you incorrectly stick with Newtonian gravity, it's not going to be trivial that they do have any, as it's pointed out that the rest mass of a photon is nil. Photons are relativistic, which is not surprising, so you shouldn't be using a non-relativistic theory to describe or conclude something about relativistic particles. Consider, for example, the standard nucleon or even a proton. The bare masses of the quarks that make up a proton add up to less than 10% of the total mass of a proton, so you have to wonder where the rest of the energy comes from. And it comes from that \"gravitational pull\" of the color field. Relativity dictates the equivalence of mass and energy, so it is not surprising that all matter exerts or influences other matter. This is because (if we talk in GR terms), there's an associated stress-energy tensor which is the source for the gravitational field via Einstein's equations [Wald]. ** There are other gotchas, such as photons having a non-zero pressure. [1] Stress\u2013energy tensor[2] According to GR, the source of gravity is the stress-energy tensor. Energy (density) is a component, as is pressure, and momentum, etc...[3] You can think about the big bang and the early universe where it was entirely dominated by radiation, so we see cosmological effects involving gravity there.

            "answer_text": "Without thinking about the rest-relative mass of a photon, you can safely say that a photon will travel from point A to point B following the geodesic path between those points. A geodesic is a straight line in Euclidean geometry (flat). But it turns out that spacetime (an entity of united space and time) is not flat, it is curved (from a lot of General Relativity). And the geodesic is also curved in a curved spacetime. And also it turns out that massive objects curve the spacetime around them. Thus if a photon beam is coming near a massive object, it will be seen as it was bending towards that massive object, but in fact the beam is only following the geodesic as it should. ",
