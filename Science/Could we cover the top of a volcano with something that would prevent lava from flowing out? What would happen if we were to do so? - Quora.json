            "answer_text": "Did you hear something about a \"hill\" called Mt. Pel\u00e9e? It was plugged by a 700 m long stone needle. And she was erupted. The result was a quite interesting phenomenon. A cloud, moving fast as a TGV, heated to several hundred grad celsius and carriing large amount of different size pebble. It reached a small city within minutes, leaving 3 survivor of the 30.000+ population.Other volcanos simply explode in such situation.The volcanos built usually not from solid stone. They are layers of solidified lava and loose ashes. The bottom of the craters is usually solid rock, so in case of higher volcanoes, like Etna in Sicilly the main crater rarely flood lava. But since the raising magma make a solid push to the sides of lava channels, it usually push through the side of the volcano, creating new side craters (called parasite crater). Other volcanos, having more gaseous magma, creating stronger and more sudden push to the sides on the crater, erupting explosively.So simply cover the top of the crater results nothing. Drilling a hole to the magmachamber, and let the accumulating gases and lava has an easy and continuous outflow could reduce the size of eruptions effectively. But currently we have no technology that could survive in the circumstances of magmachamber without destruction or plugging. But at least, we can tell, the volcano is getting ready to erupt, or not.

            "answer_text": "The eruption of Mt Taupo ~25,000 BC was large enough to not only completely destroy the mountain, but also form the second largest lake in Oceania. The eruption of Tarawera in 1886 was similar, leveling the mountain and creating a rift in the earth 17km long. Volcanoes play on their terms, and they don't play nice. As mentioned in other replies, plugging the top would make things worse. Think of filling up a water balloon; no matter how thick the skin is it will eventually burst, and the more water in it at the time, the worse it will be. The only way to fix this is to either apply a greater pressure from the outside than there is on the inside, or to relieve pressure inside by putting small holes in it and relieving pressure. Most vents are already capped by stone, and simply blow open when erupting. If you were to cap it with a stronger and more heat resistant material (after you invent one that could withstand such conditions), then the volcano would simply blow through the earth around it. You would in theory need to surround the entire vent, magna chamber, and all vents coming of it with your new material. I'll be impressed if you manage such a feat. ",

            "answer_text": "Volcanoes that are plugged shut are by far the more dangerous kind.  If lava flows freely, because it has low viscosity (i.e. it's 'thin' or 'watery'), you have a lava flow to deal with, but that's not too bad. Yes it's dangerous, but you know where it is, and even if it changes course you have time to move out of the way.  Some volcanoes get plugged up, because the lava is so viscous and slow-flowing that it cools and hardens in the mouth of the volcano, or because the caldera collapses. This is bad. If the lava can't flow out, it builds up pressure. Think of blowing up a balloon. Unless the balloon is leaky, pressure builds up until the rubber can't take the strain, and BANG! the balloon pops, with a noise loud enough to startle you badly, perhaps sending shreds of rubber flying through the air. Now scale it up a bit. Instead of your breath you have the force of millions of tons of molten rock. The mountain can take much more strain than a balloon, but it has limits. The flanks of a volcano can bulge by tens of metres, until the pressure is too much -- and now the lava bursts out, not in a manageable trickle but an explosive fountain; and instead of a few shreds of balloon rubber, thousands of tons of rock is blown to powder in a shower of rocks and superheated ash that rushes down the mountainside in a deadly cloud -- this, not lava, is what moves fast enough to bury cities in its path, burning anything living in its path. It's a bit louder than a popped balloon, too. When the famous volcano Krakatau exploded, in 1883, the explosion was heard 3,000 miles away. It launched about 25 cubic kilometres of rock into the air (picture a cube of rock six miles to a side, now pulverise it), which lingered in the atmosphere, lowered the average surface temperature of the Earth by 1.2 degrees Celsius, and upset global weather systems for five years. The pressure wave circled the globe three times. In short, it would not be a good idea to plug up a volcano. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably the best thing to prevent a volcano from erupting with devastating force would be to drill holes. This would encourage minor eruptions and allow lava chambers to lower the pressure.  If you ever shaken a bottle with fizz and uncorked/opened it then you do quickly realize that just letting off steam is not exactly what is happening. Lava almost always contains high pressure gas which will fizz much like a shaken bottle. Clearly the drilling team would have to consist of heroes.  The reason why this solution has been proposed and yet never been done yet is similar to why earthquakes are not prevented. There a fairly good understanding how to do that: inject lubricants / water directly in the fault lines. This would allow the earth to un-stress in a much softer way and induce a large amount of minor shocks. While this method would work it would instant cause trillions of dollar court cases because the direct correlation of humans doing something and property being damaged. Lets not forget that last year in Italy a team trying to predict a earthquake went to jail for failing to be able to pinpoint the day and time. (Scientists convicted of manslaughter for failing to warn of earthquake ) ",
