            "answer_text": "I wanted to offer a size comparison of the 10 closest white dwarfs, but couldn\u2019t find information on the radii for LP 145-141 (4th nearest), Stein 2051 B (6th nearest), LP 44-113 (7th nearest) and G 99-44 (8th nearest). So instead, here are the 6 nearest white dwarf stars excluding those four[1]:  Sirius, Procyon, van Maanen\u2019s Star, 40 Eridani, L 97-12, Wolf 489 In the top left corner you can see an outline of the size of Jupiter, on the right side an outline of the Sun and in the top right an outline of the Earth for reference. Earth is 109% the size of Sirius B. Footnotes[1] List of white dwarfs - Wikipedia",
