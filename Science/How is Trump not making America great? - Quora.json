            "answer_text": "Great countries are not founded on division. They are about unity, shared purpose and caring. Great countries are not founded on racism or xenophobia. They embrace diversity and welcome the strength and resilience it brings to their fabric. Great countries aren\u2019t built by leaders who can\u2019t even figure out how to behave in a civilized, adult way on social media; who resort to infantile name-calling as the only form of political discourse that they understand; who openly mock persons with disabilities and war heroes and engage in childish public feuds with private citizens. Great countries welcome dissent. They don\u2019t meet it with acts or threats of violence. Great countries are built on the belief that the free press is a fundamental cornerstone of any free, open and democratic society, that it must be fostered and protected, not marginalized and demonized. Great countries build relationships and exert positive influence internationally. They don\u2019t create division with their allies, openly admire dictators who murder, torture and abuse the human rights of their citizens. And they don\u2019t cling to protectionist policies and incite trade wars with their closest and biggest trading partners Great countries are founded on the collective welfare of all their citizens, not on increasing the already obscene wealth of the most wealthy. Great countries are built on truth, not lies. Great countries engrave words like \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\u201d into their sacred monuments. They don\u2019t send the military to meet those huddled masses with the barrel of a gun as they arrive at the country\u2019s doorstep, seeking asylum, safety, hope, freedom. From a friend north of its northern border, I remember this great country fondly ",

            "answer_text": "OK, here is a list: National debt: Donald Trump has built all his accomplishments on borrowed money. The state deficit in USA is increasing. Sooner or later USA is going to face a financial crisis, forcing the government to implement high taxes on everybody similar to the European taxes in USA. It\u2019s like peeing in your pants in order to stay warm on a cold winter day.Making USA vulnerable #1: If the American government chooses to cut down on military expenses as a way of avoiding tax increases, then USA will become vulnerable to aggression from Russia and China, who are already investing huge sums in military buildup - soon overtaking USA with e.g. hypersonic weapons, to which USA is defenseless according to American generals.Making USA vulnerable #2: Trump is causing polarization of the American people over race and gender. As written in the New Testament: \u201cEvery kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.\u201d (Matthew 12:25)A clown and a fool: The rest of the world is laughing at Donald Trump, because it seems impossible for him to utter just one sentence without being a liar or showing his ignorance - like when he saluted a North Korean general. People in Europe are constantly telling Trump-jokes - just like they constantly told jokes about Hitler or Mussolini during the second world war.Respect: It\u2019s hard for the rest of the world to respect Donald Trump, when he couldn\u2019t stand up against Vladimir Putin, when he met him in Helsinki in July 2018. He said he believed Putin more than he believed FBI. And when he returned to Washington his excuses for doing so were lame and weak. People are guessing that Trump owes money to Russian oligarchs owned by Putin - if that is true, how is Trump going to stand up against Russian during a real military crisis like e.g. the Cuba crisis or Pearl Harbour?Poverty within USA: I am not living in USA, but reports from USA repeat over and over that Donald Trump has done nothing to improve the situation for two thirds of the population, who are just as poor now as before Trump was elected to become president. It\u2019s only the richest third, who benefit from Donald Trump\u2019s rule. Of course, if you are a Trump supporter, you wouldn\u2019t care about this issue at all, even though these poor people are American citizens. For this reason I shall not wast your time by mentioning Donald Trump\u2019s administrative cruelty towards immigrants.Anti-democratic: Donald Trump admires and makes friendships with the most tyrannic anti-democratic dictators in the world like Vladimir Putin, Rodrigo Duterte, Kim Jong-Un, Mohammad bin Salman\u2026 apparently driven by pecuniary motives. The problem with making deals with the Devil like this is that there is always a price to be paid in the long run - as with the above mentioned national debt.To conclude the matter, Donald Trump has not made America great in any way - instead he has weakened USA - but in a way that will be felt harder and harder over time.
