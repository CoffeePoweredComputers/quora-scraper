            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s first drop the qualifier scientific. The word hypothesis is synonymous with the words guess and conjecture. It is an attempt to provide an explanation, generally in cases where there is an unsolved problem or perhaps just a mystery that we want to make less mysterious. Now that we understand that, we can ask: when is a hypothesis scientific? It becomes a scientific hypothesis when we can think of ways to test it with some kind of objective experiment. An experiment is objective only when others can perform the same experiment and agree on the outcome of the experiment. Any hypothesis that is not testable is not scientific. Finally, why are scientific hypotheses important? Because they are what allows us to reliably advance our understanding of reality. It is only through our attempts to find objective explanations that others can confirm that we can advance our understanding of reality. There was a period in history about 500 years ago that historians call the Scientific Revolution. Before then, there were people who did, in essence, apply the scientific method and advance our understanding of reality, but those advances were isolated events, spread out over both time and geographic locations. It was only with the Scientific Revolution that any real momentum in scientific advancement began. The result was a very large increase in the rate at which we gained knowledge. The Scientific Revolution led to the Industrial Revolution, which led to various technological revolutions, and the current information revolution. ",

            "answer_text": "A scientific hypothesis is an explanation of events that enables you to predict or produce a phenomenon. When I do WXY, or when W, X, and Y happen, Z always results. Or wherever there is a P, Q will be found. If a hypothesis cannot be tested, it may be testable in the future. But if it clearly cannot be tested at all, it is not scientific. Also, a hypothesis must be capable of being proved false, \u201cfalsifiable.\u201d Thus a hypothesis of the following form is not scientific: \u201cWhen A happens, B might happen, or maybe not.\u201d It is not scientific because it cannot be tested. The hypothesis we call Evolution is not falsifiable in many ways. First, there are too many \u201cmillions and millions of years\u201d to conduct a test for any major change. Second, no one can watch every individual of every species all the time to determine when and how a mutation occurs and the effect on that individual\u2019s life and the species. Third, Evolution has too many explanations that include \u201cmaybe or maybe not\u201d to be falsifiable. Some birds (e.g., sparrows) are drably camouflaged to hide from predators. Some birds in exactly the same environment (e.g., cardinals) are brilliantly colored to \u201cattract females.\u201d The sparrows apparently prosper without attracting females. And the cardinals apparently thrive without hiding from predators. Neither theory can be falsified. \u201cSexual selection\u201d was one of Darwin\u2019s trophy hypotheses to explain bizarre features that nothing else could explain. That idea admits that the males (like Blue Tarantulas) really don\u2019t have a purpose for that silly coloring, and therefore they developed that characteristic to please the spiders of the opposite sex. The explanation is totally empty and really explains nothing. It leaves totally unstated (big black hole) any explanation for the entire race of female spiders developing a preference for blue males, or vice versa. They just did. Or \u201cjust so,\u201d as Rudyard Kipling titled his silly stories about animal origins. What is more, no one can predict it, and no one can produce it. In short, it is not testable and not falsifiable. And without test, it is not a scientific theory. It is \u201cjust so.\u201d You can see that \u201csexual selection\u201d explanation at work with the massive antlers Irish elk. Now, with that elk, everyone knows why they became extinct: \u201c[The antlers] are thought to have eventually become so unwieldy that the Irish elk could not carry on the normal business of life, so became extinct.\u201d Truly. The antlers were developed by natural selection to aid survival, but became so helpful to the survival of the animal that it died out. All in the same breath and without blushing. Karl Popper, a famous philosopher of science, poked many holes in Evolution theory because it does not stand up to the rigor required of real science. ",
