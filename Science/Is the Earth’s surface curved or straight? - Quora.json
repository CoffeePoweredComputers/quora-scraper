            "answer_text": "Why go anonymous on this? The earth in my yard is pretty flat. The earth over the fields near me is pretty rough - all ploughed up, and it goes uphill. So that\u2019s not flat. The earth in the Rockies is pretty steep in places, definitely not flat. The earth under the oceans is sometimes flat, but there are huge canyons, too. Not so flat there. The earth looked at from an altitude could appear flat, depending on how high you are, but it still might look uneven. The earth from space looks like a sphere. The further you go, the more like a sphere it looks. No-one has been further than the moon (where they took photos of the earth and it looks like a sphere from there), so I am guessing when I say that if you go far enough, you won\u2019t even see the shape\u2026 or the planet, for that matter.

Not until 300 yrs later did Pythagoras propose that the earth was round. Not until Colombus sailed round the world did people generally accept that the earth was round. Bizzarely, there are some who still don't accept it today. ",
