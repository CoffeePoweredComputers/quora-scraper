            "answer_text": "Modern women now have smaller hips. That sounds a little dumb, but the actual science behind it is a little disturbing. This is a scar from a Caesarean-section delivery.  While C-sections are not a new thing and have been around since before the time of Christ, the mortality rates involving them were extremely high. In fact, mothers surviving the procedure were unheard of until the 1500s, and it was only after the development of antiseptics and anesthetics in the 1800s that it became relatively common for both the mother and the baby to survive. Despite that, the mortality rate of C-sections for the mother and child was still around 85% in Britain during the 1800\u2019s, and higher elsewhere in the world. With advances in medicine and surgical techniques, however, that mortality rate has been greatly lowered in the modern age, and today the mortality rate is well below 1% (something like .31 in 10,000). Today, the global rate of C-sections is 18.6%. This is the global average. In the US, 1 in 3 women have a C-section - a full 32%. And a good majority of that is elective - meaning the mother voluntarily sought delivery by C-section, instead of as a last resort in case something went wrong. Contrast that to how in the US back in the \u201860s the rate was just 5.5%, and globally it was even lower although it\u2019s difficult to get figures for that. In some countries like Brazil the C-section rate today is over 50% \u2014 Brazil and the Dominican Republic lead the world at 55.6% and 56.4% respectively. The result of all this tummy slicing, however, is troubling: women\u2019s pelvises are getting narrower. The research shows that in the \u201860s, 30 in 1,000 births had too narrow a birth canal for the baby to go through. Today, that number is 36 in 1,000. While an extra six smaller-hipped women doesn\u2019t sound like much, statistically that\u2019s a 20% increase in the rate of women having smaller pelvic canals. It\u2019s probably too small a change to be significant at this point, and this is just after about 50 years after all, but it\u2019s the beginning of a trend towards something. We will likely see a more pronounced change after another 100 or 1,000 years. It\u2019s happening because the women and children who would have died during childbirth are now alive and well, passing on their smaller pelvic genes to the next generation. The rate of C-sections increased dramatically around the \u201890s, and it will be interesting to study why that is the case, but that\u2019s something for another time after much reading. Regardless, the high C-section deliveries are surely affecting our evolution as a species, as it directly relates to the reproductive cycle \u2014 one of the key drivers of evolution. The worry is that eventually, C-sections might become the norm, and even required for most cases, which would be disastrous. We would be moving from elective c-sections to mandatory c-sections, and that just scares me. *** Wow I never thought I\u2019d see the day that I\u2019d get 1,000+ upvotes, thanks for reading, whether you disagree with the answer or not! *** ",
