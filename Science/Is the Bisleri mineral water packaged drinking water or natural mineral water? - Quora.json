            "answer_text": "Mineral salt additives are generally added to drinking water that are purified using \u2018Distillation\u2019 or \u2018Reverse Osmosis\u2019, to recoup for the lost minerals \u2014 during evaporation or by high rejection of RO Membrane, respectively. Adding them is just making R.O water into real sense mineral water. Many companies add minerals in required proportions to purified water for our health and to improve the taste.Bisleri adds magnesium sulphate and potassium bicarbonate (Per 100ml of water, Mg=0.2mg; K=0.1mg). It purifies locally available water (micron filtration and ozonisaition) and then add minerals to it. Hope it helps ",
