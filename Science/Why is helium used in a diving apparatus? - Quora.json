            "answer_text": "Air contains a large amount of nitrogen and the solubility of gases in liquids increases with increase in pressure. When sea divers dive deep into the sea, due to an increase in pressure, large amount of nitrogen dissolves in their blood. When they come back to the surface, solubility of nitrogen decreases and it separates from the blood and forms small air bubbles. This leads to a dangerous medical condition called bends, DCS (Decompression Sickness). Also there are chances of Nitrogen Narcosis. It is caused by the anesthetic effect of certain gases at high pressure. Narcosis produces a state similar to drunkenness (alcohol intoxication), or nitrous oxide inhalation. Therefore, air in oxygen cylinders used for diving is diluted with helium gas. This is done as He is sparingly less soluble in blood Advantages of using Helium in diving apparatus:- 1.Helium has very little narcotic effect. 2. A lower proportion of oxygen reduces the risk of oxygen toxicity on deep dives. 3.The lower density of helium reduces breathing resistance at depth. Because of its low molecular weight, helium enters and leaves tissues more rapidly than nitrogen as the pressure is increased or reduced (this is called on-gassing and off-gassing). 4.Because of its lower solubility, helium does not load tissues as heavily as nitrogen, but at the same time the tissues can not support as high an amount of helium when super-saturated. 5.In effect, helium is a faster gas to saturate and desaturate, which is a distinct advantage in saturation diving, but less so in bounce diving, where the increased rate of off-gassing is largely counterbalanced by the equivalently increased rate of on-gassing.
