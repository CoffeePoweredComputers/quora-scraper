            "answer_text": "If you're dead-set on just doing directly biology-related work, it might be hard to find a job with a bio major. I got a BS in a biology-type major (Ecology, Evolution and Biodiversity). I was able to get a job right after graduating due to internships I did during the summers between my sophomore and junior year. The job was more related to molecular biology, but I also liked that, so I was fine with it. (I got to do genetic sequencing, which was cool, and I was super fortunate that my boss collaborated with a professor so it was not standard lab-grunt work.)  However, I didn't feel like there was much advancement possible without a masters, or without going into management. I didn't really want to go for a masters, and I didn't find the idea of being a manager very appealing. I ended up switching careers to copyediting technical material (engineering textbooks). If you're super attached to getting a lucrative job, a bio major might not be the best choice unless you're thinking about med school.  However! As the other people have said, studying what you like is pretty important. As long as you're flexible and keep your eyes open, your major doesn't really limit you once you graduate.  I would definitely try to get internships while you're at college--it helps provide you with job experience before graduating from college, and also helps you figure out if you'd actually like doing the work that's related to your field. And of course it looks good if you end up deciding to go to grad school. Keep an eye out for internships at companies, not just the college internships--internships at companies can often lead to jobs straight after college if you make a good impression while you're interning, and you're also likely to actually make a bit of money.

            "answer_text": "Good in what way?   I love that I got a BS in Bio.  I wish I would have gotten a  BS in applied Biology.  I love the knowledge I have acquired.   However once you get a BS Bio, your jobs are limited. Teach, Go back to school and get a PhD, MD, Vet or Dental Degree.   I have never made money with my Biology Degree.  I applied for a research position and they told me they would interview me but the job  paid $11/hour (1995 ) and it was planed to go to one of the 5 PhD's that would graduate that year. Now if you love Biology so much that money is of no matter then hell yes. Go for it.  Find a job you like and you will never work a day in your life.   You can alway get a PhD and lead a lab or something.   Also  you can look in the Sunday's paper and look for companies wanting ppl with Biology Degrees.   I don't think there is a big demand.  Hope this helps.  I know 3 friends that have biology degrees (4 ppl if you count me.) Everyone obtained another degree at the BS Level or Higher before they got a job. ",
