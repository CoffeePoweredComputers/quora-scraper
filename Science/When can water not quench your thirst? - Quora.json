            "answer_text": "Water is needed to carryout a lot of biological process in the body at a cellular level. We transport nutrients and reject toxins by regulating and renewing water supply. A sufficient amount of water content is needed at all times to sustain life. So whenever this water content in the body cells is at a lower than optimum level, signals are sent to the brain to replenish and we feel thirsty and drink water. Osmotic pressure is a property that from thermodynamics perspective defines the chemical potential of water. Think of it as a driving force that would drive flow until an equilibrium of water concentration is achieved when 2 fluids are in contact via a semipermeable membrane. Cells have semipermeable walls which can only exchange water. Normally when we drink pure water which has low osmotic pressure, the osmotic pressure of fluids inside the cells pulls the water through semipermeable cell wall and this re-establishes the water balance in the body. Hence our thirst is quenched by basic thermodynamic equilibrium. In case of impure water i.e. water having too much salt, too much sugar or any other dissolved impurities that can raise the osmotic pressure enough so that this water when entered in the body starts pulling water from cells would lead to one\u2019s thirst not being quenched. What actually happens is - you feel bloated and more thirsty as the water you just drank pulls out more water from the the body cells. This is the reason why you should not drink seawater as it can dehydrate you further because of too much dissolved salt. Also, soft-drinks with too much sugar and dissolved stuff can lead to similar effect. Also eating too much salty food can lead to high osmotic pressure outside cell walls and when you drink water it is not enough to disturb this equilibrium leading to you feeling bloated and thirsty even after you drink pure water. There can be health reasons like diabetes which can lead to one feeling thirsty all the time even after drinking water. Hence in summary - water with high salt, sugar and other dissolved entities may not quench your thirst. Drinking water after a high salt laden, high sugar laden diet will not quench your thirst. And finally there can be health reasons like diabetes that can lead to normal water not quenching one\u2019s thirst. ",

            "answer_text": "Water won\u2019t quench your thirst if it has too much salt in it, that\u2019s why you can\u2019t drink sea water. If that\u2019s not the case, you may have diabetes, because one of the symptoms of diabetes is an unquenchable thirst. Another potential cause of an unquenchable thirst is anemia. That happens when your body doesn\u2019t have enough healthy red blood cells. If you find that you have an unquenchable thirst, you should talk to your doctor because there may be underlying health issues ",
