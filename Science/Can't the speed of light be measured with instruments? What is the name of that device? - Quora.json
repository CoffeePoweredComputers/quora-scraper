            "answer_text": "Agreed. Cern suggests that the limiting factor is not the speed of light but the speed of force, which determines the max velocity for all forms of propagation through space. Thinking about it as speed of force makes more sense and should open up for new ways to quantify it, for example in conjunction with studying entanglement. ",
