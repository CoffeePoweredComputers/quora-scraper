            "answer_text": "What are the cells, chains and cycles in mathematics? Cells, chains and cycles are general concepts in higher dimensions to replace, for example, paths or surfaces of integration, and a more general statement of Stokes theorem, with the boundary of a chain used in place o the boundary of a surface, and a chain used in place of a surface. Cells  To define a chain, first consider the definition of a k-dimensional cell  on manifold M as the triple (P, g, ), where P = Bounded convex k-dimensional polyhedron g:   g(P) M, g is differentiable  = Orientation of P on  Chains  Rather than using g(P) as a submanifold of M, the concept of a k-dimensional chain c is introduced as defined by  where mis the multiplicity of  (positive, negative or zero), where each  is a k-dimensional oriented cell and where the boundary  of the chain is given by  Cycles  If  = 0, then  is called a cycle . A set of cycles which differ by the boundary of chain (i.e.,  = -) is said to be homologous. For example, consider two k-dim cycles , e.g., closed loops around a vortex tube, then  =  -  With these definitions of a chain and a cycle, Stokes\u2019 theorem can be written as Stokes\u2019 theorem ",
