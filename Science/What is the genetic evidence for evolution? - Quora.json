            "answer_text": "This is a long explanation, but if you can read it and understand it, you will know why our DNA proves that we all came from a common ancestor. Let me say right off, that some people have claimed that you MUST have copies of the \u2018Before\u2019 and \u2018After\u2019 genes, to prove that two different animals are descended from a common ancestor. But I want to make it clear that you do not need to have a copy of the \u2018before and after\u2019 to prove that they are descended from a common ancestor. All you need is the \u2018after.\u2019 Let\u2019s use something other than DNA, in this case we\u2019ll use Linguistics as an example of this. Look at languages such as English and French, or Spanish and German, or Russian and Hittite, or Hindi and Norwegian. They are all related because they are descended from the same ancestor language. This is OBVIOUS. How could English and Russian share so many similarities unless they came from the same source, once upon a time. And, by the way, LINGUISTS (you know, the experts who study languages) have been able to take ALL the Indo-European languages and roll them back, step by step, to come to a common ancestor language, whish is Proto-Indo-European, a DEAD language from 6 or 7 thousand years ago. Do you know what word the original Indo-Europeans from 6000 years ago used for \u2018Sister?\u2019 It isn\u2019t written down. There was no writing then. But we know, from having rolled things back, step by step, that the Proto Indo European word for Sister was Swesor. Brother was Brehter. Snow was Sneig or Sneyg. Horse was Ekwos (remember the Latin word Equis? Similar, isn\u2019t it.) Linguists literally have recreated thousands of Proto Indo European words, with nearly 100% certainty, because we know how to \u2018read\u2019 the changes in languages, and roll them back, step by step. Well, if they can do that with Proto Indo European, I\u2019m here to tell you that it is even clearer and easier to roll things back to a common ancestor when you read the genes. You can go back, step by step to earlier forms that no longer exist. I choose Genetics as proof of evolution because I am a Geneticist. One of my degrees was in Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering. I studied with not one, but TWO Nobel Prize Winning Geneticist (who each won in different years for different projects). Genetics was always something that I loved. So, being a geneticist, I understand it better, and the evidence that it provides for Evolution. As a geneticist I can tell you this, the genetic evidence for evolution is completely unassailable. I honestly don\u2019t think there is ANYONE who really understands genetics who will claim that they don\u2019t see evolution in the genes. AND I honestly will say right now that anyone who claims to be a geneticist who doesn\u2019t understand these things is not really a geneticist. And I am willing to argue that with anyone, because, Genetics is one of the strongest areas for evolution. It is OBVIOUS if you know how to understand our genes. The only people I know of who are actual genetics experts who believe in Creationism are the \u2018long term\u2019 \u2018Old Earth\u2019 Creationists. The ones who believe that God used Evolution to achieve whatever goals he had. In other words, they agree that Evolution is real. They just believe it was \u2018guided.\u2019 And I know that the Young Earth Creationist who are always STRICTLY interpreting the bible must also reject the Old Earth Creationists, because Young Earth Creationists deny that the earth, and the Universe is old. Even though there literally is a universe of evidence for that. Anyway, when you look at the genome, species that are related have the exact same changes and mistakes in their DNA, in the same places. And how much of these genetic \u2018mistakes\u2019 they share is directly proportional to their relatedness. I say mistakes, but I mean things like, the same bad genes, the same good genes, the same \u2018ghost genes\u2019 (inactive genes from the past), the same inversions, translocations, duplications, deletions, single nucleotide polymorphisms and other genetic markers. Let me tell you that there are millions of genetic markers you can compare. And how much they each have of this exact same material, how much they share, is completely predictable, based on their evolutionary relatedness. Species that share a recent common ancestor have more of the genetic similarities. Species that are farther away and have a common ancestor that is farther back still have genetic similarities, but there are less, and once again, it is in exact proportion to their relatedness. The same things can be said for the amino acid sequences in the proteins. Species that are more closely related share proteins that are more closely related. Again, in direct proportion to how far back their last common ancestor was. Proteins are the end result of genes. Proteins change slowly over time, but we share \u2018close proteins\u2019 with close relatives. For example, we have proteins like INSULIN, which are so close to the same proteins in other animals, that we can use theirs. We can use the insulin from Pigs and Beef and Dogs, and, in fat, that is how all insulin used to be. We got it from those sources. Looking at ALL of our proteins, we share MORE THAN 99% protein congruity with Chimpanzees. Slightly less with gorillas, from whom we split about 14 million years ago. Less still with the rodents, because we shared our last common ancestor with the rodents 70 million years ago. And even less with pigs, because we split with them 80 million years ago. And less than that with dogs, from whom we split 95 million years ago. Proteins are made up of amino acids. All life on earth pretty much uses the same 20 amino acids, despite the fact that there are hundreds, if not thousands of potential amino acids. The genes in the DNA contain the instructions to string together the amino acids to make those proteins. But then we see one of the biggest evidences that we descend from common ancestors, and that evidence is from Codon Redundancy in how our genes make proteins. In other words, we use a certain set of redundant codons to make a particular protein. A redundant codon is where you can get the exact same amino acid inserted into a protein, by using a completely different DNA \u2018word\u2019 (a codon), but which means the same thing. Redundant Codons are INVISIBLE outside the DNA itself, because they produce the exact same effect, just by using a different instruction. So, Evolution (survival of the fittest) can not see the Redundant Codons. Evolution cannot select for redundant codons. Evolution can select for proteins and for the amino acids in those proteins, but it cannot select for the \u2018command word\u2019 that puts a particular amino acid in a particular place, because evolution only sees and selects the end result. So, when an animal makes a protein that is, say, 400 amino acids long, and it uses the same redundant codons in the same place that are also used by another species, you know it could not be there by chance, and it also could not be there because evolution \u2018told it so.\u2019 It can only be there because their common ancestor had the same pattern with the same redundant codons in the same place, and it didn\u2019t change much since then, because Evolution cannot see it. Each amino acid can have anywhere from ONE codon (one DNA \u2018word\u2019) which codes for it (methionine is the only amino acid with only 1 codon) up to 6 different codons, to code for the same amino acid. Other than Methionine all other amino acids have 2 to 6 redundant codons. A redundant codon is one where any one of up to 6 other codons could have given the same result, the same amino acid in the same place. The average protein in the human body has over 400 amino acids in it. So, when you take the whole string of 400 amino acids, you will see that it could have been done quadrillions of different ways with a different codon used every time at every one of the codon locations for the 20 different types of amino acids (except Methionine, since it only has one codon). Calculate it yourself. Let\u2019s just assume that each Amino Acid has only TWO redundant codons, instead of up to 6. Now, calculate 2 (two codon options) to the 400th power (because you have 400 amino acids in the protein). Running the calculation, you end up with a number of different combinations equal to this number, below. Ready? Your chance of coming to the same result by chance, without being related, is: 1 chance in 2,582,250,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 That is a real number and a real calculation. I\u2019m not making that up. It has 120 zeros in it. And that is for only ONE protein out of the 10,000 or more different proteins we make in our bodies. DO YOU REALIZE THAT THIS NUMBER IS LARGER THAN GOOGLE? IT IS ALSO A LARGER NUMBER THAN THERE ARE PARTICLES IN THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. So, to calculate the chance that we DO NOT share an ancestor with chimpanzees, take that number, above, and multiply IT to the 10,000th power. (Because we have over 10,000 essentially identical proteins with chimps.) That number is so close to infinity as to make no difference. I mean really. You can\u2019t deny these numbers. If you understand what I am saying, you will realize that we clearly are 100% descended from common ancestors with all other life on earth, and the closer our common ancestor was, the closer we are genetically, and the more redundant codons we share in our protein synthesis. And that is just the Codon Redundancy evidence, not even including all the other genetic evidence. When you see this, you will understand that the only way the different animals could use the same codons is if they are related. Because even with the exact same amino acid sequences , to get the same protein by using DIFFERENT Redundant (codons, and there are literally quadrillions of quadrillions of quadrillions of different codon combinations), you simply cannot arrive there by chance, unless they are derived from a common ancestor, so that their genes all share the same \u2018choices.\u2019 So, what are the chances that we and dogs or we and horses use the exact same redundant codons in the exact same place? We do share them, but the chances for that are AN IMPOSSIBLE NUMBER to one. In other words, NO CHANCE that it is random that we use the same codons in the same place. We MUST share the \u2018choices\u2019 in the codon redundancy for only two possible reasons: First option. We are descended from a common ancestor, and have evolved gradually since then. They had the same redundant codons in the same places, so we have the same redundant codons in the same places. To the degree that out genes have diverged, our redundant codons have also diverged, but the areas where our genes are the same, are also the areas where we use the same redundant codons and it can ONLY be because it was that way in our common ancestor. It simply is statistically impossible that it happened by chance.Second option. God created us, and chimps and horses and pigs and rats and dogs and he MADE ALL OF OUR DNA LOOK EXACTLY LIKE IT IS THAT WAY BECAUSE OF EVOLUTION AND DESCENT FROM OUR COMMON ANCESTORS. In other words, if God did it, it is still indistinguishable from having happened naturally by evolution.WE, stupid men, could decide to make a protein, say, duplicate the insulin protein, and we could do it by stringing together an entirely different set of redundant codons, PUTTING A DIFFERENT CODON IN EVERY PLACE, EXCEPT FOR METHIONINE (which is the only amino acid without redundant codons), and yet still get the same protein. So, if WE could do it entirely differently, why did God make it the same, just EXACTLY like if we were descended from the same ancestors? There are so many evidences for evolution that are built into our genes that it literally is impossible to deny, if you understand what I am talking about. And I mean that. Either we are descended from common ancestors with ALL other life, and our genes show the history of changes that came from those same common ancestors, or God made it look just like Evolution happened that way, because the way he set it up it looks exactly like we are all genetically related. And you only get there if we are related, as in we all came from common \u2018parents.\u2019 Why would God have made it look exactly like evolution happened, if it didn\u2019t? Is he trying to fool us? Of all the quadrillions of quadrillions of quadrillions of combinations he could choose to make man, why did he choose the one single combination he did. And why did he choose essentially the same combination for chimps. And why did he choose only a slightly different combination for dogs? There is so much more. Why do we have the same ghost genes in the same places in our genome that chimps have, and have SOME of the same ghost genes that horses have and slightly less (but still most) of the same ghost genes that dogs have? Descent from a common ancestor with all other life is real. And that is how you know evolution is real. ",

            "answer_text": "The very content of DNA is the proof. The precise sequence of the hundreds of thousands of base pairs present in each of the chromosomes of each of the trillion cells that make up each large organism maps out the story of our evolution. DNA content, when interpreted in reverse, points, PREDICTABLY, at the singular origin shared by all known life forms on earth. DNA content shows us that we are far more closely related to other great apes than to monkeys, less related to whales and dogs, less still to amphibians and birds and less still to bananas and fungi... But related still. DNA isn't just the blueprints of life, it is the history book of life.  Besides, there are many experiments in which evolution has been observed in real time, such as at the Michigan lab where for the past 27 or so years thousands of generations of a bacteria colony have been observed to radically adapt to new environments as predicted by Natural Selection.
