H2(g) + I2(g) <=> 2HI(g) \u2026\u2026\u2026 \u0394H is negative (exothermic) For an exothermic reaction we can envision \u201cheat\u201d as a product, then treat it like any other reactant or product when applying Le Chatelier\u2019s principle. H2(g) + I2(g) <=> 2HI(g) + heat A decrease in temperature is like removing \u201cheat\u201d, which disturbs the system. Therefore, according to Le Chatelier\u2019s principle, the system will shift to the right to make more heat and re-establish equilibrium. The partial pressures of H2 and I2 will decrease, and the partial pressure of HI will increase. ",

            "answer_text": "As the reaction is exothermic, according to Le- Chatelier principle, the equilibrium will move backwards that means the   rate of forward reaction will increase, if you decrease the temperature.        According to Le-chatelier principle... Low temperature is always favourable for exothermic reactions. ",

            "answer_text": "In an exothermic reaction, heat is a product. A temperature decrease removes some of that \u201cproduct,\u201d so the equilibrium should shift to the right to replace it. Thus, the new equilibrium mixture will contain a higher amount of hydrogen iodide than the equilibrium established at higher temperature. ",
