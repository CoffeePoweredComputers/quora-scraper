If the milk-water mixture should contain 10% water, then amount of water to be added is 'V' then 171= (180 + V) x 0.9 solving the equation we get 171= 162 + 0.9V So V= 9/0.9= 10 kg. So on adfing 10 kg of Water, to 180 kg of milk-water mixture containing 5% water will be diluted to a mixture containing 10% water or 90% milk. ",
