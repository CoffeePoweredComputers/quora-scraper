            "answer_text": "First let us look at the tales of the tape at their maximum. Sperm whale weighs 57 tons, is 60 feet long, width 2 rows of 26 teeth each on both sides of the lower jaw, each tooth is 7.5 inches long weighing 1 kilo. It has a jaw large enough to engulf a giant squid. The sperm whale has sonar that can echolocate a giant squid. The giant squid weighs 1 ton, is 43 feet long (the colossal squid being 46 feet) and has a beak barely 3 inches long. It has no jaws capable of swallowing big chunks of food. It has smoke screen to hide in. To summarize, the giant squid is no match for a sperm whale. Wherever she is, the sperm whale will find her with the whale\u2019s sonar. The squid\u2019s ink screen won\u2019t work against echolocation. The squids only chance is to put down a whale and drown him (he is air-breathing mammal), but how can a 1-ton creature put down a challenger 57 tons heavy. The sperm whale can swallow a giant squid, the squid can\u2019t swallow even a whale\u2019s fin. The sperm whale has two arrays of 7.5-inch long teeth, 26 in a row. The squid boasts only of her barely 3 inches long pair of beak. They might be of equal length but there is a big disparity in weight. Attack autotomy might be the squid\u2019s chance to escape, i. e., break off some arms to get away. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, Lemuel the battle is too deep (from 300m-2Km deep) for anyone to have ever witnessed, so I\u2019ll dish out a bit of speculation\u2026 First off, sperm whales do a deep dive to get at the giant squids, its primary source of food, although it will take other smaller squid and octopus. It\u2019s obvious they have been quite successful at it, for, in continuing to be an extant species, they\u2019ve been on that squid diet for a long time. The sperm whale fossil record begins in the Late Oligocene 28\u201323 mya. Females nurse and take care of their young until the age of 10 years-old when they are large enough to make the dives on their own. These whales are diving because they are hungry and that drive gives them the advantage in utilizing their derived technique in capturing the squids. However, supposing a squid put up a long enough fight, it could perhaps drown the whale. Whales have been found washed up with giant squid sucker scars, but due to their skin locations, in no way were they responsible for the whales\u2019 mortality. Lastly, the squid may have perished in the battle, but after it was consumed, got its revenge on the whale. Ambergris is produced by the whale due to irritation of the stomach and intestine linings by a squid\u2019s beak that it recently ate. More than for producing some of the world\u2019s most expensive perfumes, ambergris\u2019 first and foremost function is to lubricate the whales digestive lining. It is quite possible that just after being eaten, the squid\u2019s sharp keratinous beak could shred or tear the lining in a whale\u2019s digestive tract before there was enough time for lubrication leading the whale to a slow but eventual death\u2026 ",
