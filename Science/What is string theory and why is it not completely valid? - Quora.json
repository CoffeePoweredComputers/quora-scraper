            "answer_text": "(Hi Haya) Wow! Thats a great question that could start a bar fight if enough physicists were in there! In any event, gentle questioner, and readers in general, this is an answer of several paragraphs or several dozen textbooks. Given our format here and my broad but shallow knowledge base of a plethora of subjects, including things stringy, lets go with shorter. Also lets all keep in mind the enormous complexity of a subject with almost six decades of history and literally thousands of really smart people contributing to its development and you\u2019ll see why we will only be scratching the surface, so general readers, professional physicists, and ever-lurking commenters, beware! First, some basic basics: Every physicist worth her/his salt, including Albert E. in the latter part of his career, has given some thought, or even dedicated a whole career to a Theory of Everything (TOE).A TOE is the mathematical/predictive bridge between the theory of relativity (the behavior of very large things under the influence of gravity) and quantum mechanics (the behavior of very small things under the influence of electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force).Basically, what people are looking for is a quantum formulation or mathematical statement of gravity, and the reason why it is so weak compared to the other three basic forces. The most popular competitor versus string or superstring theory is called Loop Quantum Gravity, which is a whole different set of textbooks.So, anyway, one of the reasons that physicists came up with the precursor to string theory in the first place, way back in 1960, was the difficulty in working with, mathematically, subatomic particles. These particles were considered \u201cpoint\u201d particles which had no dimensions to speak of, physical sizes which were inconsequential compared to everything else. When these essentially \u201czero\u201d dimensions were plugged into the partial differential equations that physicists use to model and predict the behavior of subatomic particles and the systems they form and the interactions between them, they got infinities as their solutions. Now, one thing that physicists hate like poison 95% of the time, is infinity as the solution to an equation. (The other 5% of the time they just hate them regular.) In order to get rid of the infinities and make the equations make sense, they have to go through a very tedious process called \u201crenormalization\u201d. I\u2019m not sure what this entails, but I\u2019ve been led to believe that it\u2019s something that physicists hate more than infinities, they try to avoid it like the plague, and almost always assign it to their graduate assistants. The neat thing about strings is that they are not zero-dimensional like points, but one-dimensional like lines, so the problem with plugging zeros into the equations goes away, and no more renormalization. Yay! The other neat thing about strings, and what contributes even more to their popularity is that by their very nature (trust me on this or we\u2019ll never get done here) strings vibrate like crazy, I mean really really fast. Each vibrational state can be proven to match the characteristics of each of the known subatomic particles, proton, neutron, electron, etc. These vibrational states were likened to musical notes or tones, adding to the elegance or cachet of the theory. But, the thing that made them catch on like fire almost out of nowhere was that one of the first vibrational states proposed, back in 1974, was recognized to perfectly match the physical characteristics of the graviton, a predicted, highly sought after, but alas, totally undetected subatomic gauge boson, the carrier particle for the gravitational force. Another name for the graviton (detection thereof) is \u201cInstant Nobel Prize-Atron\u201d. Hence, the popularity of strings soared. Unfortunately, the very early models of string theory only described bosons, or force carriers, not matter particles. This was because bosons, as force carriers or transmitters (photons, gluons, Higgs bosons, W and Z bosons) obey certain specific rules called Bose-Einstein statistics. As such, the string theory of everything, as neat as it was with gravitons and all, was incomplete, and only those physicists who had invested a great amount of time and effort into its development and promulgation up to this point kept the faith and saw it through. It took a while, but their faith was to be rewarded. During the period 1984\u20131994, the first \u201csuperstring\u201d revolution occurred. Between 1984 and 1986, several revolutionary discoveries which are too complicated to even begin to describe here convinced physicists that string theory, now dubbed superstring theory because it was combined with a concept called supersymmetry, could describe ALL elementary particles, both bosons AND fermions. Fermions are the matter particles which we named previously, neutrons, protons, etc., which obey laws called Fermi-Einstein statistics, whence they get their family name. Superstring theory was now the subject of not only difficult to understand scholarly articles and papers by renowned physicists and mathematicians, but easy to misunderstand popular articles by science and magazine writers. Superstring theory was wildly popular again, despite the fact that to make it work, some pretty astounding assumptions about the physical nature of our universe had to be made. More on this later. What we can say about the period following this first revolution and preceding the second is that some physicists proposed and followed through on some pretty far-reaching extensions of the theory, to the point where a lot of people who were skeptical about superstrings in the first place got downright hostile. During the period 1997\u20132003, a second, subtler revolution occurred, when it was realized that a lot of the different variations of the proposed superstring theories were really just different versions of the same thing, kind of like the facets of a crystal: it just depends on how you are looking at it. Thus, during a relatively short period of time, as these things go, the theory gained new legs, and was renamed (again) as M-Theory. No one will commit to what the M really stands for, some say \u201cmagic\u201d, some say \u201cmembrane\u201d (for the higher dimensional geometries described), some say \u201cmultiple\u201d (for the multiple universes the theory suggests), the list goes on and on. The initial problem with the theory was that it didn\u2019t work in our commonly understood 4 dimensional universe (3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension). As a matter of fact, the earliest versions of the theory required a lot of room for the strings to vibrate in, and theorists kept adding dimensions, some thought a little recklessly, until the math worked out. Well, it turns out that the math didn\u2019t quite work until the strings were vibrating in 22 dimensions\u2026yeah, you heard right, twenty-two. A lot of people were immediately turned off by this and saw it as a big problem. Where are all of these extra dimensions? they asked. It turns out that they are extremely tiny, as the size scale of the strings is ridiculously small, much smaller than the smallest subatomic particle. The second revolution, which unified all of the variations of theory initially proposed, reduced this plethora of dimensions into a kind of more easily digestible 11, and there are solid logical reasons (which are again way too long and complex for this format) for these 11, not just because it makes the equations work, but that\u2019s a lot of it. The real true practical reason that superstring theory and all of its associated very cool and very exciting ramifications, like the holographic principle, and branes, and multiple bubble universes, is that anything that it has predicted has not been detected. This is a strong statement, but I\u2019ll stick by it. Fancy mathematical proofs aside, there has been no real world particle accelerator, laboratory, LIGO type statistically testable result of anything that string theory says is supposed to be out there. Ther\u2019s too much hand-waving going on at this point, I\u2019m sorry to say, and some very smart people, people a lot smarter than me disagree, but that\u2019s the iron-clad proof of any theory: does it predict the behavior of the real world? We obtained the first proof of Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity in 1919, when the bending of light was observed during a total eclipse of the sun. Testable, repeatable, verifiable proofs of that theory have been happening ever since. I would love to see superstring theory work and have the existence of multiple dimensions proven, but until we see some 5 or 6 sigma reliable data of some of its predictions, then I think that it may have to fall by the wayside.

A.#2: Who says that it is \u201cnot completely valid\u201d? Given the (growing and increasingly varied) applicability (see above), claims of its invalidity are greatly exaggerated.
