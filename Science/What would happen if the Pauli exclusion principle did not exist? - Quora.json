            "answer_text": "The Pauli exclusion principle determines the position and spin of electrons, when the two outer electron orbitals of two atoms that are adjacent and begin to overlap, the Pauli exclusion principle forces these orbits to become distorted so that no two electrons with the same spin can get too close to each other. As soon as the orbits start to overlap and distort, it results in a repulsive force between the atoms due to this principle. Only two electrons can be in the same orbit around a nucleus, one electron will have spin up and the other one will have spin down. The total wave function for two identical fermions is anti-symmetric with respect to the exchange of particles. For bosons, the total wave function for two identical bosons is symmetric with respect to exchange of the particles. The Pauli exclusion principle force is always repulsive, it never causes attraction between single electrons or between whole atoms. Without this principle an atom of one element would stick to an atom of any other element. The larger the atomic number of any two elements, the more strongly they would bind together. Everything would bind together and never part, the increased mass would result in a massive release of energy. This, of course, does not happen because of the Pauli exclusion principle, that will not permit that many electrons to be confined in such a small volume. Bosonic electrons, behave differently as more and more atoms can be added together until it would approach the density of a neutron star with all the electrons merging into the nuclei of the atoms. The other interesting observation of electron spin, is that it can generate magnetic momentum, the opposite spins of the two electrons in the same orbital cancel out their magnetic properties. Atoms without paired electrons that are spinning in the same direction contain net magnetic moments and are slightly attracted to magnets. If there is random electron movement there will be no net magnetic force, however, if the unpaired electrons are parallel to the same direction, the particles will exhibit magnetic momentum. ",

            "answer_text": "Every atomic nucleus would bind its electrons in the ground state, so the electrons would be much more strongly bound to the atom than they are. Further, these atoms would react with each other much more strongly than in the real world. A basic property of what we call matter is that its binding energy grows proportionally to the number of particles involved. In other words, if on block of matter is twice as large as another, the binding energy per particle remains constant. In this hypothetical world this would not be true: particles would be more strongly bound to large objects. I guess that would mean everything pretty much collapses. ",
