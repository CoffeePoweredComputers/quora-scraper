            "answer_text": "Imagine a small, fixed amount of energy like a tap. A tap could move a Pebble. But it couldn't move a Boulder. It's the same on the molecular level. A small amount of energy could move a small molecule, but not move a large molecule. Well, this is what the Diffusion is. A large amount of energy will move a lot of pebbles or a lot of small molecules, but a small number of rocks and a small number of large molecules. ",

            "answer_text": "Heat is random kinetic energy, so at any given temperature, all molecules have the same average kinetic energy. (There is a statistical distribution, but they all have the same average, and given the time over which diffusion is measured, average is adequate.) The average velocities are therefore inversely proportional to the square root of their masses. The slower they move, the longer it takes to diffuse the same distance. ",
