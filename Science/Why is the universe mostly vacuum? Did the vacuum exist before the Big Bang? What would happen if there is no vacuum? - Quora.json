            "answer_text": "I do not understand. The universe is not mostly vacuum. Or rather, vacuum is relative. Vacuum just means \u201cthere is a lot less stuff there than there is here\u201d, really. There are lots of things that seem pretty \u201cnon-vacuum\u201d in space that we would consider a vacuum on the surface of the Earth. Here we usually consider anything below about 25 Torr a medium vacuum and anything below about 0.0001 Torr a hard vacuum. The \u2018surface\u2019 of the sun has a density of about [math]10^{-4} kg/m^3[/math]. If that were air then this would correspond to about 0.070 Torr (70 mTorr)\u2026 a pretty good medium vacuum. Is the sun a vacuum? (Interestingly the sun is a lot less dense than we usually think of\u2026 it doesn\u2019t reach the density of water until you are about half way from the \u2018surface\u2019 to the centre!)  <source: wikipedia, NASA/SDO (AIA)> So relative to our scale the Sun, or at least a lot of it, is a vacuum. Just a very glowy one! Is the Earth a vacuum? Certainly not by our standards\u2026 but compared to, say, degenerate matter in a white dwarf the crust of the Earth is about the same as a hard vacuum has compared to us (about [math]10^9 kg/m^3[/math]). And that white dwarf is basically a vacuum compared to a neutron star (something x [math]10^{17} kg/m^3[/math]). Throw a neutron star at a white dwarf and it will pass through it as if it was just more vacuum. Because relative to that it is \u2014 something like the Earth is just a slightly lower grade vacuum to a neutron star! Similarly most objects such as dust clouds and nebulae are hard vacuums by our standards\u2026 but they collide and interact and on their scale might as well be considered objects with real substance!  <Veil Nebula: source Hubble Space Telescope. Credit: NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)> The structures in this image are caused by collisions of high energy gas. We would call them hard vacuum. The \u201cempty\u201d space around this is also full of material, just at a lower density. And so on. There are very few parts of space that are \u201cempty\u201d (if any), though again it is all relative to the scale.  <large scale structure of the universe: Volker Springel - Max Planck Institute For Astrophysics> So\u2026 vacuum is not a simple concept. There is something in most places, more in some places than others. But almost wherever you fix your attention there are things that make that look \u201cfull\u201d and things that make that look like a \u201cvacuum\u201d. The reason that you see most of the universe as vacuum is that you happen to live on an above average density bit of that universe, so your scale is set pretty far over to one end. But rest assured, there are plenty of scales (and, who knows, maybe life-forms too) relative to which you are vacuum yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe the universe is mostly vacuum because space is constantly being created within the quarks of matter. Before the universe existed there was no vacuum or space. Nothing existed and then the universe was created in a Big bang. It was very high energy and then it cooled to form matter. Suddenly space began to be created in a phenomenal rate known as inflation. I believe this is due to the close proximity of all matter and the creation of virtual particles. I believe that space is created as a bubble of vacuum between quarks of matter when virtual particles annihilate there. This somehow captures the strong force in the bubbles and they flow outward from matter. Since space is constantly created in matter, it is compressed by the existing space. Compressed space in matter and coming from matter present probable locations for quarks and photons so they are attracted to the centers of mass. This I believe is the operation of gravity. Forget about time, it doesn\u2019t exist unless it is measured by an observer but I will agree that intervals are longer within a more compressed space because many more positions have to be traversed to complete a movement. If you had no vacuum or space then the universe would be static and non moving instead of all things being in constant motion through the existing space of our universe. ",
