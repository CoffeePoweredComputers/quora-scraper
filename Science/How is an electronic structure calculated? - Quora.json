            "answer_text": "Hello I'm assuming you mean electronic structure of an atom. While calculating the electronic structure of an atom of any eleement have the following things in mind The first or outermost shell can contain a maximum of 2 electronsOther shells contain Maximum of 8Now , when calculating the electronic structure of an element , for example , Sodium You should already know that sodium has an atomic number of 11 and the atomic number is also the number of electrons on the atom provided the atom is neutral the first innermost shell of sodium will take 2 out Of the 11 available electrons the second shell is left with 9 electrons to choose from , but remember that the shell can take maximum of 8 electrons . So it takes 8 out of the 9 , leaving one a third shell , which is the outermost shell has 1 electron left . Since it's maximum is 8 , the shell takes the one left and still has space for one electron the electronic structure is then given as the number of electrons on each shell, from the innermost to the outermost The electronic structure of sodium is then given as 2,8,1 ",
