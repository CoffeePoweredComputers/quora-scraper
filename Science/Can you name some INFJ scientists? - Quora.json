I just read an article about the fact that there were 75% more T than F types in STEM fields but that the F types performed equally well or better. (Who might they be?) My doctor is an INFJ . I\u2019m not a scientist but I worked in RRT/biomedical engineering doing \u2018science\u2019. It\u2019s harder to tell INFJs from INTJs when they are at work, especially if everyone is working on science. ",
