            "answer_text": "Philosophy is defined as love for wisdom. It is unique to humans as only man is gifted with the ability to think. The evolutionists claim that humans\u2019 superior abilities over other creatures are the result of evolution: natural selection of the fittest, though they are silent on how the evolutionary process is initiated and maintained. Religious people believe that everything including evolution (if it exists) is the result of creation and design. They have continued to argue until today. No end seems in sight. Philosophy is closely related to man\u2019s addiction to thinking. Man differs from animals in that we possess a sense of identity, a sense of self which makes us stand out from the rest individually. Animals too have a sense of self and self-preservation but it is man who makes a big issue of it so much so it affects his experience of living. This exaggerated self-identity and preoccupation is the ego. Ego is non-existent. It is an illusion of the mind to create a false sense of reality and endurance. It is the ego\u2019s way to overcome its own vulnerability and death. It is a tool of the mind for self-preservation and propagation of the false identity. In the end everything has to be surrendered and nothing gets preserved. In addition to the main soul, God gave us a sub-spirit which is situated just below the navel. It is the seat of desire without which we will not have the drive to compete and fend for ourselves and civilization will stagnate. However, this desire thing can become overbearing and result in self-caused sufferings. Ego is a product of desire for self-preservation and material and psychological gains. Unrestrained ego is the seed of disharmony and confrontation. It is also the reason for war. Ego drives a person away from God and others. It gives a person a false sense of wellbeing or the opposite. It is the cause of evil and sin. In order to validify its existence, ego resorts to the use of certain faculties already in existence. One of them is mind and its most potent tool: thinking. Thinking depends on time and separation in order to thrive. Time is separated into past and future. The present seldom exists. It is just a link connecting the past to the future. Separation is the tendency to view oneself as a distinct and independent entity to the exclusion of the others, except as a means for comparison and conquest. It makes for quite an unhappy and unliked individual. The mind is the place to store memories, record information, perceived and remembered slights, imaginary revenges, relive memorable experiences\u2026In short, it is a place to live a phantom or vicarious life. It may be quite out of synch with reality but its machinations are so potent and overpowering, they corrupt reality to such an extent to make life unreal and unenjoyable, except in the unseen prison of one\u2019s imaginations. As a storehouse for past memories and knowledge, the mind cannot access the new. All it knows has been known. Indeed, contaminated with human thoughts and emotions, our likes and dislikes, all that the mind can do is to salvage from the past, configure it and give it a new name. And when more people indulge in such intellectual activities and challenge one another through discussions and debates, it becomes nothing more than stirring the backwater of jaded ideas and fanciful imaginings.  Insight comes with intuition or revelation, more so when one is free from thoughts. Indeed, the more one can be empty of thinking and emotions, the easier it is for inspiration to enter. All one needs to do is to forget (abandon) oneself (one\u2019s ego) and live to the fullest. If philosophy can be defined as man\u2019s love and search for wisdom through thinking, then its only benefit is for the thinker to realize that no insight can be obtained through thinking. It is only when one stops thinking and starts living in the present moment and in the process discards all that is unnecessary and self-serving, that one begins to attain wisdom and joy. This is the essence of living. ",

            "answer_text": "I understand the sentiment behind the question. Well into adulthood, philosophy (e.g. Hume or Logical Positivism) seemed to me as useful as, \u201cHow many angels can dance on the head of a pin,\u201d until I found a good one and learned what it is. Philosophy is crucial to human life, which is why every culture has one (usually a religion, a form of philosophy), and every person has one whether they know it or not. Good way to think of it is that a philosophy proposes answers to three questions: What is there? How do I know it? and, So what? 1. What is the nature of reality? Is there a spirit world and physical world? Is reality an illusion? Is there just one objective reality, independent of any consciousness. 2. How can I learn about what exists? Revelation from gods, ESP? Or from our senses and reason. 3. How should I live my life? Selfless service to others? Getting ahead by any means? Or by making the most of myself and enjoying the rewards, not sacrificing other to myself or vice versa? 3b. How should society be structured? Should we give total control to \u201creally smart people\u201d like Stalin and Castro? Should we \u201chelp\u201d unproductive people with handouts, taken from the productive? Or should we recognize every individual has rights \u2014 to be left free to make the most of his life (and therefore that all help to others must be voluntary)? As human beings, we can't do anything without some kind of answers these questions. We believe/hold some answers, even bad ones, whether we know it or not. The better they are, the more objective, the better they will guide us in life. Religions often say there is a spirit world, \u201csuperior\u201d to our physical reality, which we come to know through holy texts, introspection (prayer), and revelation from the gods. We should eschew \u201cthis world\u201d and live for \u201cthe next\u201d. A skeptic might say reality is nothing in particular, unknowable, so anything goes. A philosophy which claims to be objective would say that facts are what they are, we know them through our senses and reason. (Etc.) The challenging thing about objective philosophy is that you don't get it through deduction. It doesn't come by invoking arbitrary premises and a series of \u201cIf A, then B.\u201d You have to look at myriad facts and abstract from them, always ensuring that new conclusions don't contradict prior ones, at every step tying your new abstraction to the natures of the entities involved. Induction is a skill well worth learning, and it yields a philosophy that helps one in life. ",
