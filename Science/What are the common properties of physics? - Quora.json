            "answer_text": "The natural science that involves the study of matter and itsmotion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how theuniverse behaves.\u200b Physics is one of the oldestacademic disciplines, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion ofastronomy. Over the last two millennia, physics was a part ofnatural philosophy along withchemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics, but during the scientific revolution in the 17th century, the natural sciences emerged as uniqueresearch programs in their own right. Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics andquantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are notrigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences while opening new avenues of research in areas such as mathematics and philosophy.Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs. For example, advances in the understanding ofelectromagnetism or nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such astelevision, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances inthermodynamics led to the development of industrialization, and advances in mechanicsinspired the development ofcalculus.
