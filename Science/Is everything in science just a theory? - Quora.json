            "answer_text": "sorta. Everything we understand in science is presented as a theory. A scientific theory is an idea or explanation or rule or law or etc of science. Something becomes a theory through validation through scientific facts, experiments, and observations. For example: The leading scientific theory of explaining the universe and our position in it was that the universe was geocentric, or that earth was the center of the universe, at least it was that way thousands of years ago. Plato and Pythagoras(ancient Greek philosophers and scientists) reckoned that the Earth was stationary as the stars and sun revolved around them, and they also thought the Earth was round. They \u201cproved\u201d this through scientific reasoning and tests.  But then the Heliocentric model, or that the sun is the center of the Universe, outdid it by disproving the theory, and it was kind of more scientifically correct than the theory of geocentricism.  now we know that their really is no \u201ccenter of the universe\u201d another example: people thought there was a flat earth based on the fact that it doesn\u2019t look round(This was the observation and evidence that they had).  but then, Pythagoras discredited that by studying other planets and natural satellites and eclipses  (and we have TONS OF MORE EVIDENCE today putting the flat earth theory to shame, including pictures of a spherical earth!). If you are a flat earther yourself, check this link out: Top 10 Ways to Know the Earth is Not Flat All of these earlier theories were considered \u201cright\u201d in their own times, until they got outdone by more straight-up-science! Everything we know in science is governed by theories, and theories are right by being backed up by scientific evidence until we can disprove of them, which we never may if we actually got it right! Although, sometimes we literally cannot prove a theory wrong due to lacking technologies and evidence. Basically, theories are the thing we go by until a better one comes up but thats just a theory A scientific theory! and cut. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Yes, in the sense that the theory explains phenomenon, and the ultimate aim of each experiment is to disprove incorrect ideas, so that we can use what remains to improve or create theories. No in the sense that it's not just a theory. That statement is just as erroneous as saying \u2018Michael Phelps is just a swimmer\u2019 or \u2018a Ferrari is just a car.\u2019 Technically, they are all true statements. But using just belies the significance behind them. Michael Phelps isn't just a swimmer, he is among the greatest swimmers to ever live. A Ferrari isn't just a car, it is among the finest cars ever produced. Likewise, nothing in science is just a theory; theories stand as the pinnacle of scientific knowledge and certainty. However, in my personal opinion, anyone who provides that statement as a defence against anything in science, can be labeled as just another person who has no clue what they are talking about. ",

And only when a model has been validated does it actually gain the status of a theory (which differs from the colloquial meaning of theory which is more like a hypothesis/speculation). ",

Yes, we can create equipment which can detect actual reality, but that equipment exists in actual reality, so it proves nothing. It merely makes our belief stronger. ",
