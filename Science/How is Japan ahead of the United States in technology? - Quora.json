Quoting a famous american physicist: \u201cIf you think back to the early years after World War II, America was the dominant player almost right across the board in advanced industries. Now there is hardly an industry left where that can be said. Meanwhile Japan has continued to gain dominance in dozens of advanced industries.\u201d ",
