            "answer_text": "I don't exactly have figures to tell u but oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen.Think logically electronegatIviy is e the average of ionisation enthalpy and election gain enthalpy In case I of nitrogen ionisation enthalpy is highly positive and electron gain enthalpy is highly positive,therefore average is positive But in case of oxygen ionisation enthalpy is positive but electron gain enthalpy is negative.and it's clear that ionisation enthalpy of oxygen is less than that of nitrogen. So do the maths stuff and u will find that oxygen will be more electronegative than nitrogen. ",
