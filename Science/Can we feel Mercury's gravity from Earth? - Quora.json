            "answer_text": "In the universe all the stars and the planets has its own gravitational field, mathematically which spreads out to infinite distance.But the gravitational force on earth due to mercury is calculated by the equation. F=G.(m1\u00d7m2)/r(square) where G(universal gravitational constant),(m1,m2)(mass of earth and mercury), r(distance between their centre). From this equation we can see that F is inversely proportional to r(square). So, the distance between Earth and Mercury is very very large, it means the gravitational force is very very small, so that we could not feel it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. There is an attractive gravitational force between all entities that have mass. The closer the two entities, the stronger the force. And, the more massive the entities, the stronger the force. The gravitational force between you and mercury is quite weak, since mercury isn't close enough or massive enough to pull you very hard. So, we can technically feel Mercury's gravitational pull from Earth, but it is so weak that it is pretty much ignorable. ",

            "answer_text": "It is assumed other planets have gravity, however as gravity is NOT a force (Newton\u2019s 3rd Law), it is constant and only present within the atmosphere; the ONLY other constant in the atmosphere being nitrogen atoms, nitrogen IS gravity. As no other planet (or moon) has primarily a nitrogen atmosphere, gravity does NOT exist anywhere other than on EARTH, thus, the answer is \u201cno\u201d. ",
