            "answer_text": "Define \u201cEmpty\u201d. As far as we have been able to determine, all the fundamental particles are point-like (if they have a size or sub-components, these are too small or too closely bound for us to determine). An atom is made of electrons(fundamental) and neutrons and protons. Neutrons and Protons are made out of three quarks (fundamental). So in one sense, yes. No finite number of mathematical points can fill space. On the other hand, something is holding those components together in the pattern we see as atoms. That something is often expressed as fields, or as exchange of virtual particles (which are excitations of a field). And a field is a mathematical structure which associates one or more numbers with every point in space. An infinity of points in any finite volume, even one as small as an atom. So you can say it\u2019s full of virtual particles or fields, or of empty space (which is not empty in the everyday meaning of that term because it\u2019s also full of the same fields and virtual particles, just lacking the electrons and quarks which the question excluded) Back in the infancy of computers, long before the term \u201cvirtual reality\u201d was coined, Feynman attempted to describe the universe in terms of only the fundamental particles, with three-dimensional space being an illusion emerging from the interactions between particles, rather than a reality within which the particles existed. It\u2019s a lovely idea but he couldn\u2019t make it work for the real world. Then he found quantum electrodynamics and Feynman diagrams, which did work. Ultimately, the only language that works for any of this is mathematics. English is too vague and its concepts too deeply linked to the mechanics of objects weighing between a gram and a tonne moving at a tiny fraction of the speed of light. For an atom we can define a formula for the likelyhood of detecting an electron at every location with respect to its center, and experimentally we can measure that electron density, most commonly with X-ray diffraction. The observations and the formulae agree. But we can never determine where any particular electron is now, because to detect an electron we have to smash it so hard (with an X-ray photon) that it\u2019s no longer anywhere near that atom at all! I\u2019m quite happy thinking of electron density functions (and nucleon density functions if ever needed) as a sort of fog of electron-stuff and nucleon-stuff, analogously to the way an aircraft designer uses air density, not individual molecules. For chemistry and materials science, this works pretty well. So with that approximation, an atom is mostly full of electron-stuff of varying density, and its nucleus is a much smaller much more dense lump of mostly nucleon-stuff. But it\u2019s an approximate visualisation, a bit better than the old sun-and-planets visualisation. For reality as best we know, you have to use maths. ",

            "answer_text": "It isn't 100% empty. You see, the usual atom representation is badly wrong.  You see this? Okay, it's the usual representation of an atom. Everyone has seen it, right? But it's so wrong. The atom is considered to be 99.99999% empty because, the nucleus size it's much smaller than in the picture. And the electrons too. My Chemistry teacher, back in high school, once made a comparison: If we enlarge a Hydrogen atom, just enough so it's nucleus (a single proton) can be the size of a tennis ball, and we put it in the middle of a soccer field, in the largest stadium of the world, the electrons would be passing by at the parking lot.
