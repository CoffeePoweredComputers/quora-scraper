            "answer_text": "From my point of view, it can be irritating when they confidently state something is busted or plausible based on a short, simple experiment that totally discounts an array of real-life possibilities.  However, I have to ask whether it truly matters. In any case, even their sometimes flawed methods are FAR preferable to the status quo, which is masses believing everything on the news or in movies/TV. Those things have little to no responsibility (or in news, history) or representing reality accurately. So you have people believing in an occasionally slightly flawed version of reality rather than an entirely made-up one. That is a good thing. Plus, if it gets people interested in STEM then it's undoubtedly a good thing. Haven't you ever watched Mythbusters and just wanted to go and build some shit? That's the kind of thinking the show helps to inspire, so whether it's 100% accurate or just 90% is not is really not a big deal. At least it's not 1% accurate like most media. ",

            "answer_text": "The Mythbuster experiments are: Fun to watch (entertainment)  Make science/ experiments look more appealing to the average person which is good for science.Do what they are supposed to do which is normally see if a myth is possible.The thing is that generally testing a myth for plausibility requires a very small n (number of trials) and outside variables are rarely taken into account.  This is very different from an average scientific experiment where you have to control for as many outside variables as possible and make sure that what you are doing is very reproducible by having a large n and doing the experiment in a very controlled environment.  So Mythbuster experiments are fun to watch and a great way to excite lay people about science but they are not really scientific experiments. ",
