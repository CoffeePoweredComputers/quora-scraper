When life began on Earth there probably had to be a lot of mixing, energy added and chemistry taking place to form molecules, then form more complex molecules to lead to biologic precursors that would ultimately lead to life. The noted Miller-Urey experiment Harold Urey - Wikipedia was able to form amino acids from a gaseous mixture of ammonia, hydrogen, methane and water with electrical spark added to boot. ",
