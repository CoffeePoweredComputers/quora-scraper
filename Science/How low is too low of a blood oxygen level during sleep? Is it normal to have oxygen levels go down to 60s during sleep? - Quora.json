            "answer_text": "There are a couple of considerations here. Is the measurement accurate? The further below 80% you get, the more inaccurate pulse oximeters become. In any case oxygen desaturation below 80% is considered severe. How long was the desaturation? Brief desaturations are less clinically significant than longer stretches. A single drop to 60% may not be as important as hours at 80%. In any case, saturations should ideally be 95+% and become clinically significant when they drop below 90%. Consider CPAP or other treatment in consultation with your health care provider. ",

            "answer_text": "With sats in the 60s you are BLUE!!! I promise. Sleep apnea is NOT what\u2019s going on. I agree with the first person. How do you know? Usually that is a bad connection somewhere. I\u2019ve seen actual sats in 60s. Those people don\u2019t wake easily. Most of the time they don\u2019t wake up again. At 80s you are confused usually fighting everyone and making no sense. They don\u2019t recognize anyone. Drop another 20 points they won\u2019t move. Check everything. And get to a doctor!!!! You can drop that low with a heart arrhythmia. That\u2019s so very dangerous. Start looking for answers. ",
