            "answer_text": "Tellurium atoms are arranged in chain like fashion inside hexagonal unit cells. However, there exists evidences regarding appreciable lateral interactions among these chains. In other words, chains are laterally linked to each other forming bunches. Due to this it needs higher energy to separate the chains and melt tellurium and hence has high melting point. ",
