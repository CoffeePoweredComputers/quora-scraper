            "answer_text": "If you mean ( cheap) types like this :  or  the answer is very simple and short : NO they don\u2019t, work as a real pH meter, they / you can not measure pH with 1 or 2 metal pins in the ground. If they could work why would we in the lab use expensive and fragile complex glass electrodes instead of sturdy & simple metal pins ? right because they don\u2019t work, they are not only just a bit less accurate, they even do not measure the pH. they kind of sense(measure) the conductivity and show it the user as being the pH. The soil also need to be wet, but those simplistic knock-offs will show a more acidic soil if you add some neutral salt water to it. A real pH meter does not change the pH reading if a (pH 7) KCl solution is added tot he sample. So this simple & cheap devices are totally useless, you may even get totally faulty readings who let you add Lime on an already alkaline soil, ruining your plants/crop. This is an example of a real soil pH meter : 200$ is less cheap versus the above 20$ crap but still cheaper then full & professional lab equipment.  Soil pH Meter with Separate Electrode - PH220S How pH sensors ( in general) work? :  NFI: links just show examples of bad versus useful probes ( as asked for). ",
