            "answer_text": "Answer is 1>3>2  Answer is on the basis of +H effect of methyl group when it is connected on benzene. +I and +H effect of methyl and ethyl group destabilise carbanion .  In 1st compound their is no +I or +H effect so it is most stable among all given compounds. In 3rd compound +H effect of ethyl group is weaker then methyl group of 2nd compound as their are only 2 alpha hydrogen as compared to 3 alpha hydrogens in methyl group. So 2nd compound is more stable than 3rd compound. If you consider +I effect than their is no doubt that ethyl is better +I as compared to methyl. But +H effect is dominant over +I effect so, here answer will be given on the basis of +H effect. ",

            "answer_text": "Now, I think that the answer would be based only on inductive effect. The toluene anion should be most stable, followed by paramethyl toluene and para ethyl toluene. This is because the alkyl groups are electron donating groups (+I effect). So larger the alkyl group, greater is the pushing nature. This would increase the negative charge on the carbon which is already having a negative charge. That makes it less stable. ",
