            "answer_text": "A2A. Computer science is a very broad field covering some very applied areas to theoretical computer science which isn\u2019t very different from Mathematics. Hence without further information about yourself and your interests it is impossible to give a reasonable answer. Also I personally think that the actual topic is something which emerges in interaction with the supervisor in the first year of a PhD. My own area is on the theoretical side: I am interested in the interaction between logic and programming. We study a high level language called Type Theory which can be used to implement and verify hardware or software but which is also considered a foundation of Mathematics. Recent developments are a new connection to abstract geometry called Homotopy Type Theory which has attracted considerable interest. This is an interesting area for people who have a bit of a Math background in Computer Science. ",
