            "answer_text": "The Catholic Church - not a religion, but part of the Christian religion - does not believe in a \u201cdogma of papal infallibility.\u201d The pope is not infallible, in Catholic teaching. No human is, no matter their piety, holiness, or authority. God is infallible. God promised his infallibile Spirit to be with the Church and guarantee it will prevail \u2018against the gates of hell itself\u2019. The Church - the entire communion of Christians - teaching and believing something guided by that Spirit, consistent with Scripture, and in continuity with the Tradition handed down from the Christ\u2019s own apostles, does so infallibly. Given that the whole community of Christians cannot possibly gather to hammer out details in some controversy, that is left to the leadership of the Church - the college of Bishops, altogether, with the bishop of Rome at their head / having primacy among them. The magisterium - that is, the teaching authority of the church, these bishops teaching in unity over time and space - can teach infallibly, either through an expressed declaration when all gathered together, or by something taught and believed by the whole Church through all ages in all places. Thus, the dogma of the Resurrection has never been defined by an ecumenical council - it does not need to be as it has been accepted and taught by the whole church the whole time. The hypostatic union of the two natures of Christ (divine and human) is held as infallible because it is expressly taught by an ecumenical council, and continuously received and ratified by others down through the ages What Vatican I (1870) allowed is that the bishop of Rome, having primacy among the whole college of bishops, within that context and in very limited circumstances on very limited topics, can exercise the Church\u2019s authority to confirm the infallible nature of some belief already held and taught by the Church. He does so on behalf of the whole college, after consulting with them, and, it is implied at least, only if it is not possible for the whole college to gather in council itself. (It need not be ratified by a Council, but it is hard to imagine the need for such a statement if a Council could be gathered, as that is the normative mechanism for infallible teaching and universal church governance on dogmatic and pastoral issues.) These rare occasions where the pope does so are called ex cathedra statements. There has certainly been one, in 1950 - on the bodily assumption of Mary into heaven at her death, something the Church has professed in some form or another liturgically since the 6th century and probably at a basic level for much longer. Most people would regard a second one, the Immaculate Conception, in 1854, as well - but as that occurred before a Council declared the pope had such authority, it is debatable. Some historians argue as many as seven moments throughout history that might qualify\u2026 but there was no condition of the First Vatican Council that implied this could be applied retroactively. There is no doubt whatsoever when a pope teaches infallibly. The headlines would read something like \u201cFor first time in nearly a century, pope infallibly defines X\u201d and there would be a book-length apostolic constitution or similar document explaining the one-sentence infallible statement, how it came to be, and why it was being taught outside of a General Council. Everything else falls in the usual range of doctrine, discipline, and pastoral leadership, with a wide variety of authority and application. That being said, most people jumping quickly to correct or condemn the pope in recent days have done so out of ignorance, hubris, or both. Many are guilty of dissent and other sins. Until you see the whole context - say, the entire 90-minute documentary and not only a 20 second, edited clip - you cannot judge what was said. And when you do, you must attend to both truth and charity, or your judgement suffers. ",

            "answer_text": "Among the many things that people do not understand about the Catholic Church, Papal Infallibility stands right at the top of the list. The Doctrine of Papal Infallibility, proclaimed by Pope Pius IX in 1870, simply states that when the Pope, in union with the bishops throughout the world, officially proclaims a matter of faith or morals, he speaks without error. In the ensuing 150 years since Papal Infallibility was proclaimed a doctrine infallibly exactly once, when, in 1950, Pope Pius XII proclaimed the doctrine of the Assumption of Mary into heaven to be an article of faith. In other words, if the Pope were to predict that Real Madrid will defeat Barcelona in an upcoming match, he would not be speaking infallibly. And Pope Francis\u2019s recent statement recognizing same-sex civil unions was, by no means, an infallible statement. Here are the Pope\u2019s exact words: Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family. They're children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it. The Pope\u2019s words were not a proclamation of Church teaching. He is referring to civil, secular unions, and not marriage. Most important, his words represent no change whatsoever in Church doctrine. Nor are they something new. Ten years ago, while serving as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, the future Pope Francis said: \u201cMarriage\u201d is only between a man and a woman, but civil union laws could provide legal protection for couples in long-term, committed relationships.
