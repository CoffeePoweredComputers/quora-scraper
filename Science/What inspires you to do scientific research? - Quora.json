            "answer_text": "Science has always fascinated me right from childhood. Science is a way of thinking, and it is important that people understand its value. There is so much out there that we as human beings fail to understand and by doing science, we get closer to truth. It quenches our thirst for knowledge and satisfies our childlike curiosity. This is a short paragraph taken from the book The Demon Haunted World:Science as a Candle in the Dark by Carl Sagan: \u201cThe reason science works so well is partly that built-in error correcting machinery. There are no forbidden questions in science, no matters too sensitive or delicate to be probed, no sacred truths. That openness to new ideas, combined with the most rigorous, skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, sifts the wheat from the chaff. It makes no difference how smart, august, or beloved you are. You must prove your case in the face of determined, expert criticism. Diversity and debate are valued. Opinions are encouraged to contend- substantively and in depth.\u201d This is exactly why I want to do scientific research when I grow up :) ",

            "answer_text": "I don`t do scientific research, but I do do research and a lot of it is quantitative. I am inspired by the flash of enlightenment we experience when a new idea comes to mind, connecting previously unconnected ideas. You can actually see this flash if your eyes are closed when it happens. I get this flash of inspiration when struggling with new ideas, and that is what research is all about for me! ",
