            "answer_text": "It depends. In New Zealand we have this amazing idea that if you donate blood (or blood products, even Plasma Donations), you get paid absolutely nothing! We have a bloody good blood transfusion service, because we realise and live by the idea that blood is priceless. This might be an alien concept to some, but heck, you might even try it in your country! We\u2019re also quite friendly to visitors, and if you have an accident here, our no-fault ACC insurance will pick up the tab. Even if you need fifty units of blood. Now isn\u2019t that different? Works for us. My 2c, Dr Jo. ",
