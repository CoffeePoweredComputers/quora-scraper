            "answer_text": "A region in which the union of space and time into the notion of spacetime pushes our understanding of space and time as fundamentally disparate entities to its absolute breaking point! In particular, what one regards as an instant of time and what one regards as a portion of space outside a black hole literally swap around inside! There are two main camps concerning what happens to a humble observer who passes through the event horizon. The answer, according to so-called \u201crelativists\u201d is that, due to Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle, basically nothing special happens as you fall through. You might at the very least be entertained by a spectacular light-show as the warping of spacetime in your vicinity distorts utterly the view ahead: here\u2019s a lovely artist\u2019s impression ,  Another camp, spawned in response to a potential resolution to the black hole information paradox asserts that there\u2019s a region of extraordinarily high-energy located just behind the horizon that would utterly destroy any observer that entered. This energetic barrier is colloquially referred to as a \u201cfirewall\u201d, though it\u2019s not literally a \u201cwall\u201d , or literally made of fire, in the conventional sense. Relativists don\u2019t like this idea because it goes against the basic intuition underlying Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle. Needless to say, this proposal remains highly speculative! Nevertheless, if you made it in you\u2019d be doomed. As you moved inexorably towards the curvature singularity, gravitational tidal forces would begin to stretch you (and whatever vessel you happened to be travelling in!) or \u201cspaghettify\u201d you until you (And everything around you) was violently ripper apart at the atomic level! This is even true in the event that the event horizon you encountered was not really due to a single-sided black hole (the one you might most commonly envisage in your head) but due to a wormhole. The bottom line is that traversible wormholes (where you have a chance of escaping to the other side) theoretically entail violations of causality and are widely considered to be pathological (i.e. that they don\u2019t exist in nature) to that extent. The bottom line is that, it might be the most expensive light-bending-show in the universe: the admission charge is ultimately your life! ",

We know that black holes are (usually) formed as the dense cores of very massive stars which have run out of fusion fuel and gravitationally collapsed. So they are very dense balls of collapsed matter. Their distinguishing feature as balls of matter is that they generate enough gravitational *force* (yes, gravity is a force) that light can\u2019t escape, so they are black and we can\u2019t see them directly. That doesn\u2019t throw out everything we know about how they are formed and how the gravity of massive bodies works. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, as far as what the forces are behind the event horizon, yes, one would die well before the reached whatever is at the heart of the black hole, (I would say singularity, but a lot of people tend to get butt hurt by that theory and rage in the comments). You would die probably the coolest death in the universe, (although one of the most painful): you would be killed by spaghettification. Yes, that is the scientific term for death by differences in gravitational pull. Speaking of which, that is what's behind the event horizon. As you get closer and closer to the center of the black hole, the gravity at your feet (assuming you went in feet first), would be stronger than the gravity at your head. Hence, you would be stretched out, most likely to the point where eventually all that's left of you is subatomic particles. Of course, that's only for larger, supermassive black holes. The smaller the black hole, the more extreme the gravitational differences, called tidal forces. With a small black hole, you could actually be spaghettified outside of the event horizon! I hope I answerers your question! ",
