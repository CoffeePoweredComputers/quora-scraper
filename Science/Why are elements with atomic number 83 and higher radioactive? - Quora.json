            "answer_text": "As the nucleus consists of neutrons and positively charged protons the repulsion by electromagnetism is very strong and the nucleus would blow apart. But we know there is another force that is about 100 times stronger than electromagnetism: The strong nuclear force overwhelms repulsive electromagnetism but is only short-ranged. Beginning with a specific size of the nucleus the repulsive coulomb-force (electromagnetism) becomes stronger than the strong nuclear force and the positively charged nucleus falls apart. At the uni in chemistry I had to calculate something similar: The pressure of a block of metal without any electrons. So it\u2019s about the pressure caused by the repulsive coulomb-force of the positively charged nuclei. Amazing! ;-) Here you can see a similar issue: It\u2019s in German but I will explain it!  In this illustration (graph) the distance between the nucleons (r) against the internucleonic force between them is explained. Marked by the arrow the typical nucleonic distance is at about 1.2 fm! A positive internucleonic force means repulsion, a negative force means attraction! Pink is the strong nuclear force\u2026. as you can see it\u2019s short ranged! It\u2019s attractive above a distance of about 0.3 fm and repulsive below! Blue is the repulsive coulomb-force (EM). It\u2019s a long-ranged force and as the nucleus consists of positively charged protons, it\u2019s always repulsive! At a distance of about 2.5 fm the nucleons will separate because coulomb-repulsion gets stronger than the attractive strong nuclear force.  Now\u2026. what would happen if the strong nuclear force was longer ranged? THEN those heavy radioactive elements would become more stable\u2026 and maybe so stable that they lose their radioactive decay! Their half-life-time would increase considerably\u2026. even to infinity! A nucleus with infinite half-life-time is stable! BUT: Stellar fusion would not work the way it does today. And suddenly atoms would attract themselves\u2026 a weird chaos would be the result! ;-) There have been performed some calculations by scientists about what would happen if the four fundamental forces had different relative strengths compared to todays.

            "answer_text": "Elements like to have an equal number of protons and neutrons because this makes them the most stable. Stable atoms have a binding energy that is strong enough to hold the protons and neutrons together. Even if an atom has an additional neutron or two it may remain stable. However, an additional neutron or two may upset the binding energy and cause the atom to become unstable. In an unstable atom, the nucleus changes by giving off a neutron to get back to a balanced state. As the unstable nucleus changes, it gives off radiation and is said to be radioactive. Radioactive isotopes are often called radioisotopes. atomic numbers greater than 83 are radioisotopes meaning that these elements have unstable nuclei and are radioactive. Elements with atomic numbers of 83 and less, have isotopes(stable neuclei)and most have at least one radioisotope (unstable nucleus). As a radioisotope tries to stabilize, it may transform into a new element in a process called transmutation. Hope this helps. ",
