            "answer_text": "A wave can be identified by its movement along an axis, or trajectory, whereas a wavefunction describing a wavepacket, does not.  Sinusoidal waves (left). Wavepacket (right). Wave Packet Solution  The wavepacket solution becomes very interesting in periodic space (momentum space), because the ancillary system becomes a set of similars, no matter the spatial direction. Doesn't wave function determine probability density? Effectively, yes.  The probability distribution is a result of repeated constructive and destructive interference, which results in the formation of waves \u2018on the surface of water\u2019 or more sophisticated optical effects such as the Airy disk - Wikipedia If so, how can we say that particles that have wave function are waves (etc photon)? Well, they are a collection of waves, thus a wave-packet. One sinusoidal does not have left and right bounds on its travelling axis. However, particles physically exist in space thus have characteristics such as momentum and position, which are not sufficiently described by 1 wave. A wavefunction can therefore include any number of sinusoids, from 1 (Single wave that describes the momentum in one direction without info about position) to infinity (Dirac-delta function that precisely localises the particle, without giving any info about momentum).  This treatment has important applications in practice, particularly for micro- & nano-fabrication. Many reasonably accurate results can be computed using plane-wave expansion (say designing a new microwave and beyond antenna, or a new optical waveguide), but when the physical sizes get close to the size of the wavelength, we must take into account the dimensional parameter included by the wavepackets, which is orders-of-magnitude slower to compute, if we are to use the equations directly, rather than some clever computational or mathematical artifice.

            "answer_text": "There are no particles really, except that the properties that wave come in units of action on the strength axis. These can condense out when it hits something by a corrrelating event, or a decoherence. But even then they are still waves of property. Just a localisation event in the direction of travel, but then the momentum will become correspondingly randomised. ",
