            "answer_text": "It would probably look like a blur. The difficulty in answering this question is that we are only able to see anything because of the way atoms reflect, absorb, and emit photons. If you made an atom a hundred thousand times larger, it wouldn\u2019t be an atom anymore. It wouldn\u2019t be able to interact with normal photons the way it should, so all best are off as to how, if at all, it would affect light. It might just be a dark smudge of nothing. But ignoring all that, assuming it interacts with photons like normal, it would look like a fuzzy, wavy ball. You would only be able to see the outer electron shell, and it would look like a wiggly three dimensional standing wave wrapped into a ball. Everything beneath it would be hidden. ",
