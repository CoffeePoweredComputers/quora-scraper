            "answer_text": "The simple answer; one hour is one hour relative to your own frame of reference regardless of where you are. If you are on earth or in a black hole, you can still check your watch and see one, hour pass. The complex answer (pun intended): the time dilation mapping function that tells us how time is dilated near massive bodies returns an imaginary factor beyond the event horizon.  Once [math]rc^2[/math] exceeds [math]2GM[/math] the factor will return [math]xi[/math], where [math]i = \\sqrt{-1}[/math]. Fundamentally this means that an object falling past an event horizon will have no reference to say the event horizon even existed, time will continue for them as usual, but for the outside observer the falling observer will slow, fade and vanish. There will be no sensible mapping that can describe how time and space inside the radius compare to time and space outside. Try this; throw a ball into the air. As hard as you throw it, it will rise to the limit of your ability to throw it and then then fall again. The path the ball takes through both time and space is parabolic following the functions [math]v=u+at[/math] and [math]s=ut + \\frac12at^2[/math], where let\u2019s say [math]u[/math] is the initial upwards speed, let\u2019s say 10 m/s, and [math]a[/math] is the force of gravity, let\u2019s say 10 [math]m/s^2[/math]. The ball will of course fall back to your hand, but lets change the function to this; [math]t=1\\pm\\sqrt{1-\\frac s5}[/math]. Using this version we can ask how long until the ball reaches a certain height s? For heights between 0 and 5 meters \u2014 5 meters being the highest point of the ball\u2019s arc \u2014 the answer is easy; the ball will reach 5 meters after one second, and will be at 0 meters at 0 seconds and 2 seconds. Now what if we ask at what time the ball will reach 10 meters height? The answer is [math]t=1\\pm\\sqrt{-1}[/math] seconds. We call this an imaginary number, meaning that the ball will never reach this height in any real time, and this is the same kind of number that we get when we try to calculate the mapping of time and space within the vent horizon. If we apply the same basis for interpretation this result, we have to conclude that there is no time or space within a black hole\u2019s event horizon. And yet\u2026 is this result just an artefact of the mathematics applied to it? The best answer is maybe, probably not, and let\u2019s go find out. ",

            "answer_text": "Black hole are not place for us. Here is what I previously wrote on this subject. Black holes are really misunderstood. Though black holes are part of the universe, they are not random. They are created and are calculated as to their weight to hold a certain part of the universe together (like the sun is holding our planets) and placed in the center of the parts to be held together. Of course Paradise the only stationary body of unique matter, with an absolute gravity is holding the whole universe together. They are not holes but spheres of heavy elements (not known on earth) and should be called dark gravity bodies ",
