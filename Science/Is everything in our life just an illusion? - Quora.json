            "answer_text": "You asked - \"Is everything in our life just an illusion?\" Disclaimer I must advise you that I am a Zen Buddhist and that my answer will obviously be given from a Buddhist epistemological and soteriological point of view. So, please read it and enjoy for what it is, and accept or reject it for what it is worth to you. I make this reservation because I was once 'hammered and chastised and ridiculed' by something that I posted which offended some people of the Abrahamic faiths. I also make this reservation because there is no proselytising in Buddhism. Buddhism is not a religion. Buddhism is a personal rather than a congregational calling. Buddhism is an ancient contemplative or meditative yoga practice of philosophical enquiry into the nature of all things and circumstances. Buddhism is in essence a practical cultivation of the Four Noble Truths. The Four Noble Truths are - (1) the premise that life (in the verb sense of 'living') is in broad terms 'suffering' or unsatisfactory in the overall experience of it (2) the probable main causes being 'craving' and 'delusion' [as in delusionary 'thinking'] (3) that there is a possible way to end this life of 'suffering' and that (4) this, as advocated by the Buddha, is by way of the Eightfold Noble Path. The Eightfold Noble Path can be divided into its 3 separate components :- (1) Moral or Civil Conduct :- Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood. (2) Mental Conduct or Development :- Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration (3) Wisdom Right Understanding, Right Thought [All in the transitive 'verb' sense] Introduction It looks like a very simple question but trust me, it is in fact very complicated. Why? This is because we have not defined as to whose (the subject) perspective and what (the object) is in the 'everything' that is being looked at. And then there is a further complication i.e. within which realm or dimension are we examining this hypothesis? There are infinite realms out there whether we view them as (i) the layers of an infinite 'onion' or (ii) as infinite parallel worlds (as in the movie MATRIX); all concurrent or consubstantial, endless beyond conceivability. [Refer to the inconceivable endless extant and extent of dimensions of Buddha-lands, where simultaneously one Buddha-land is in all Buddha-lands and all Buddha-lands are in one Buddha-land (the Buddhist expression is the 'Brahma Net') in the Avatamsaka Sutra and also the Brahmajala Sutra]. For the purpose of this discussion we will however restrict ourselves to :- (1) the worldly or conventional or human or experiential realm, this world of ours, this world that is 'suffering' or unsatisfactory, that is termed 'samsara' - the world of the web of deceit that subjects all in it to the immutable law of 'karma', of 'cause and effect', resulting in endless cycles of 'rebirth', due to un-expiated karmic consequences; and behind the curtain backdrop to this worldly of conventional realm is - (2) the transcendental or metaphysical or ultimate reality realm of 'sunyata' - a Sanskrit word that is usually translated into English as 'emptiness' or 'void', but that is not what it really means exactly. My own personal preference is for 'illusion' or 'phantasm'. I note that you have used the term 'illusion' in your question. The 'reality' perceived by a 'subject' of an 'object' is, we would quite naturally say, as worldly or human or experiential beings, through our mind and senses. Since 'mind and senses' fall under a broader concept or umbrella called 'acumen' or 'insight', let us use a generic term for this broader concept or umbrella i.e. - 'mind-consciousness' So whether we refer to the first - worldly or conventional or human or experiential insight or to the second - metaphysical or transcendental or ultimate insight, we will equally apply the same generic term of 'mind-consciousness' to both, to facilitate, and for ease of, our discussion. Accordingly:- (1) in the worldly or conventional or or experiential or human realm - the mind-consciousness sees and experiences the 'worldly reality' of the world of 'suffering', the world of 'samsara', the world of the immutable law of karma and endless cycles of 'rebirth', if any karmic residue remains. (2) in the transcendental or metaphysical realm - the mind-consciousness with 'equanimity' (please pause to detect the subtle difference - hint - 'like the water of a duck's back') sees the 'transcendental reality' of the 'emptiness' or 'void' or 'illusion' or 'phantasm' that is 'sunyata'. So, the quick answer to your question is as follows :- (1) as a worldly or conventional or experiential or human being, worldly thinking that you are in fact substantive in your 'ego' personae i.e. a permanent distinct and independent entity, what you worldly experience, is very real, and neither you or any other worldly being in the world can deny this, for you are what your worldly mind-consciousness imagines and sees you and everything in your life is. [Just a reminder that your worldly mind-consciousness is basically your worldly mind and its companion five senses.]. (2) as a metaphysical or transcendental being however, and seeing 'ultimate reality' through transcendental eyes or transcendental wisdom or transcendental insight - the worldly or conventional or human or experiential realm and 'everything' in it, including you, as a worldly being, is 'emptiness' or 'void' or 'illusion' or 'phantasm' that is of 'sunyata'. Explanation of Sunyata and Mind-Consciousness. Our focal point is on these twin concepts of (a) 'sunyata' and (b) 'mind-consciousness'. We will leave the discussion on 'samsara' and the immutable law of karma to some other day, even though they are integral parts of the big picture. Later on we will make reference to the word 'Self'. In Buddhism there is no 'Self' as a noun, as what is referred to as 'Soul' in Western parlance, as a substantive permanent being, whether eternal, ephemeral or ethereal. Buddhism strictly treats 'Self' as a verb, the 'thinking' of or the 'consciousness of an ego of a Self'. For the rest of the discussion I will adopt the Buddhist methodology of 'Self' as a verb. It is important and very critical that you understand and make a connection with seeing words as a 'verb' and not a 'noun' as a mind-set. Why? This is because the Buddhist explanation of the 'illusion' or 'phantasm' that is of 'sunyata' is predicated on the 'thinking' or imaging or imagination of the mind-consciousness. This premise presumes or assumes that the mental 'images' in the mind-consciousness, when it is 'thinking' (as distinct from when it is reposed like a pendulum at rest, when 'not thinking') are - (i) not ''frozen' like snapshots, but fluid and in continuous motion like a movie or virtual reality and (ii) are of a kaleidoscopic nature (** it is not necessary and therefore irrelevant to find the first cause or effect or to establish or have to prove a beginning or an end). I reiterate, focus on the verb and not the noun of a word. Buddhism is about 'thinking' (verb). Buddhism is 'thinking' (verb) about 'thinking' (verb). I know, I am beginning to sound like a broken record. But I am doing something that the Buddhist books you buy in the bookshop are failing to tell you, in terms of first principles of Buddhism, (and you will definitely thank me for being so pedantic on this point), and that is why most cultivators end up on the garden path to nowhere rather than the Middle Path of the Buddha. Here I am currently leading you to when you are 'thinking' (verb) of what the 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' means, i.e. you must and should be 'thinking' (verb) of what the mind-consciousness is doing when the mind-consciousness is 'thinking' (verb) and when it is 'not thinking' (verb). Please ponder in depth on what I have kept reiterating. Your spiritual awakening depends on it! For this is what the Buddha meant when he said that unless a person had spiritual eyes and spiritual knowledge, the concept of 'sunyata' is inconceivable, incomprehensible and ungraspable. Now a quick test as to your mental acuity. Once you start talking about a Self and a God, as nouns, you are talking the opposite to the mind-consciousness 'thinking'; for now we have humans in their 'thinking' (noun) conjunctively 'grasping' at the ego of a Self and the ego of a God-Self (or as the Hindus put Godhead). And because the mind-consciousness has been used to freeze images like a picture frame, the 'thinking' is now a noun, and therefore a falsehood for you cannot (but when you do) freeze the verb that is the 'thinking', you end up with the product (noun) of false thinking, of a Self and of a God, and voila!, the Self and the God are now suddenly conceivable, comprehensible and graspable!!! That is why in Buddhism when we say that if everything is 'sunyata' or 'illusion' or 'phantasm', then there is 'nothing' of any entity, substrate, form, concept, word or label. All these 'nouns' are 'man-made' when we presume audaciously to 'freeze' the 'thinking' (verb) and thus stop 'thinking' (verb). And this human audacity is very obvious in the ego of Self that is man. But it is a false ego if man can create and define a new noun, a new word, each to mean whatever he wants it to mean. Simply put, there is only a Self or a God because of this 'delusion' or ignorance in the false 'thinking' (verb) that the mind-consciousness can stop 'thinking' (verb) when it is 'thinking' (verb) Summing up, as we go along, so that we do not lose our flow of logic in thought - Buddhism is not about concepts or words or labels and what they mean and what their definitions are. Buddhism is basically, in a very short sentence, about 'thinking' e.g. what is the cause of suffering and what is the way to the ending of suffering?. Buddhism is therefore a meditative or contemplative (i.e. 'thinking') spiritual practice. It is about whether our 'thinking' is 'mindful' or 'not mindful', whether our 'thinking' is thoughtful or 'not thoughtful', whether it is wholesome or unwholesome, and most importantly, as I have meticulously ground it into your inner perspicacity, whether it is a delusionary 'thinking' or not. When you know that all is 'sunyata' of an 'illusion' or 'phantasm' out there, you should therefore not be clinging, grasping, longing or attaching to any noun of a 'form' or 'no form', whatever that noun of an entity, whether eternal or otherwise. Remember what I said about the 'kaleidoscopic' nature of the mind-consciousness? Even 'time' itself is considered to be an 'illusion', since there is no perceivable beginning or a foreseeable end (as we shall see later). We Buddhists take the point that there is no Self or God very seriously. That is why it hard and yet also simple to be a Buddhist! In fact, we have a saying in Zen, that if Buddha stays in your mind, kill him! It would be blasphemous or a sacrilege for us Buddhists to say that if we thought that the Buddha were a God or if we did not have the wisdom to understand the inconceivable, the incomprehensible and the ungraspable that is the 'illusion', the 'phantasm' that is 'sunyata'. And, because of 'sunyata', and here is the shocking truth or revelation, in the ultimate truth that is the 'illusion', the 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' there is no Four Noble Truths, no suffering, no end to suffering, no Eightfold Noble Path, no 'samsara', no immutable law of karma, no rebirths, no 'enlightenment' and definitely no 'nirvana' [refer to the Heart Sutra]. However those who believe in a Self behind our mortal worldly being, think otherwise, based on blind faith, religious or otherwise, as there is no scientific or philosophical logical proof. They therefore aspire that upon their death, that they can unite with their 'other side of the coin' - their omnipresent, omniscient and omnipresent God. We will now try to decipher this mysterious metaphysical concept of 'sunyata' that the Buddha described as inconceivable, incomprehensible and ungraspable by the ordinary man. (I think what he meant was by 'delusionary thinking' (verb) rather than the noun in 'ordinary man'. See even the Buddha can have a 'slip of the tongue'! Ha! ha! [Even Buddhists have a sense of humour!]. Before I begin, allow me to lead you in or warm you up as to the dialectic logic and reasoning to be used :- Illustration 1 - we have to put ourselves into a metaphysical frame of mind, where the blind can see, where the deaf can hear and where the comatose can think. Like when we see, hear and think in our dream state. Or, like when we see what we saw, hear what we heard, think what we thought at a particular time in our past, whether when young, at school, at university or more recently, other than right now. We have to think, see, hear, smell, taste and feel 'kaleidoscopically' within our mind. The mental images roll on relentlessly or we can have flashbacks but the movie show goes on! We will discuss this further as to this kaleidoscopic 'creativity' to make something out of nothing for 'dreams' are like that! We humans 'create' and 'invent' because we can 'dream'! Think about this. Even 'delusion' can have an upside! Surprise! Surprise! There is no act of God making one rich and one poor or one clever and one stupid or one pretty and one ugly. Like the moon, 'delusion' has a bright side and a dark side! It is all a dream! Illustration 2 - take the examples of the 'house and its individual windows' and the 'oxcart wheel'. There is no 'form' or substance to a 'house and its individual windows' and the 'oxcart wheel', if it were not for the 'emptiness' or 'void' that they enfold. Refer to the didactic tenet in the Heart Sutra of \"Form is Emptiness and Emptiness is Form\". According to the Mind-Consciousness School of Thought the Buddha says that the 'mind-consciousness', in its quality of equanimity of 'totally absolute' unmoving, unwavering and unchanging state of pure luminous acumen, when 'not thinking' (verb) is the creator of 'all things' when it is 'thinking'. What does the Buddha mean exactly? Not to downgrade the Buddha in anyway at all, but it is a matter of fact that the French philosopher Descartes arrived at the same conclusion, when he said - \"I think, therefore I am. [If I do not, I am not.]\". [Words within square brackets added by me for clarity of elucidation]. This is to allay any fear or pretence that the Buddha has a monopoly on wisdom. The Buddha is just another 'illusion' after all. He is only a worldly, conventional, experiential and human truth or worldly reality in the conventional world that is 'samsara'. The expression 'all things' above refer to the ever-changing never substantialising 'kaleidoscopic' phantasmagoria of all the phenomena that we each, having a mind-consciousness of an ego of Self, individually, and collectively as humanity by cross-gregarious association, perceive and live and feel the 'reality' of the worldly experience of. But the 'reality' of our worldly experience is not real because we can never find anything substantial or permanent or totally absolute that we can pinpoint and identify and grasp from one point in any moment of time to the next point in any moment of time. That includes our 'mind-consciousness of an ego of Self' or of the Buddha. And that is why this is a false 'thinking' of an 'illusory or false ego of Self' or of the Buddha! What we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, see, hear, taste, smell and touch in the 'now' and 'present' of our worldly experience of 'reality' in our mind-consciousness of an illusory or false ego of Self, is always actually already in the 'past', when you think how long it takes for our worldly 'senses' to be 'deciphered' and 'processed' and 'computed' before it is delivered as a 'present' (get the pun?) to us, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, in a sort of a 3D projection hologram (remember Star Wars plagiarising this concept through the beam-out of R2D2?) in the space or emptiness of the blank screen in or of our mind. The stars and galaxies we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, worldly see in the night sky might not be existent? Get it? This 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of what is described by the Buddha as in the 'sunyata', as in being empty or void of substance or substrate or total absoluteness in the phantasmagoria of all the phenomena that we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, worldly sense is also confirmed by applying the dialectic elliptical logic of the Greek philosophers. Everything we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, worldly know is changing and moving in 'value' as in the 'measurement' or 'determination' of it, because they are relative or subject to each other in the juxtapositioning. Take time and date, it is human knowledge based or computed. We say it is BC or AD and yet we actually do not know when Jesus was born or died. The time we set is based on the relative revolving or rotation of the sun, earth and moon, and is of use only to humans. But what about the aliens out there? So, by deduction, the past, present and future only exist in relativity with or to each other. Otherwise none of them exist. Time is relative or subjective like all things when it is dependent on this subject-object axis or matrix. If this were not true then Einstein's Theory of General Relativity is groundless. Let me give you a real life example. When you are waiting for your lover to arrive at the rendezvous, 5 minutes is like 5 hours. But when you are entwined in each other's company later, 5 hours is like 5 minutes! Accordingly, time is therefore an 'illusion'. This relativity or subjectivity or duality that all measurements or values are predicated on, means that there is nothing actually 'totally absolute' about them, which is saying that they are not of a permanent entity or substantial substrate that we can carry over from one point of moment in time to another. Accordingly, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self worldly 'thinking' (verb) - things are 'created'. At this point, I like to return to the analogy of dreams or should I say 'dreaming' (verb). Coincidentally, but it is true, the Aborigines in Australia in their folklore explains 'Creation' as 'The Dreaming'. This is an exercise in logic in abstruse logic. I am asleep and 'dreaming'. Let us say in the dreaming of the dream, I am the idealistic handsome and well endowed Casanova (unlike plain and mundane me!) performing his sexual exploits. The passion of the chase and the capture and the rapture of the conquest are all very real in the experience of it and I ended in my actual worldly being with a 'wet dream' of a dreaming. Get the picture. Let us extrapolate that it is possible that my existence is someone else's dreaming, and his 'dreaming' is also someone else's dreaming and so forth, and imagine all these 'dreaming' of dreams can be concurrent in infinite parallel worlds as indicated in the movie MATRIX! Not only that, besides the concurrence, how about the progression and the digression, that is looking at the two opposite directions of movement of the 'dreaming'? How far back? Or, how far ahead? That is why in this relativity and subjectivity there cannot be found a first cause or the beginning or at the other end, a definite terminus or termination. Now, I ask you again. What is real and what is illusory? It is all relative in perspective is it not? It comes back to the preamble - from whose (the subject) perspective and what (the object) is in the everything that is being looked at and within which realm or dimension are we examining this hypothesis? If the mind-consciousness of our worldly illusory or false ego of Self (as a collective) were to stay still like the stopping of this pendulum of thought, i.e. the pendulum at rest - the universe and all things that we, in our worldly illusory or false ego of Self, worldly imagines or dreams - will just simply disappear. So, I think we now understand or appreciate the characteristics of this 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' that is 'emptiness'. But how do we define or visualise this 'sunyata' and transpose it to the pervasive mind-consciousness that the Buddha was referring to? First, in the 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' that is 'emptiness', the mind-consciousness that it represents cannot also be anything other than a 'sunyata'. It cannot have an ego of Self, that screams out -\"I am mind-consciousness!\". For that would be like a God! But for an illusory God in 'sunyata' to have an ego of Self is to be delusional! Who wants a delusional God? To avoid this problem in Buddhism we just say - \"mind-consciousness just is\" or \"mind-consciousness is just thus\". Second, we say that mind-consciousness is 'intangible' and 'formless' like the 'quality' of the 'reflectivity' that is the 'backing' of a mirror. This inherent 'quality' of 'reflectivity' in the matter that is the 'backing' of the mirror, unlike the physical character of form of the backing itself, is however unborn, undying, unmoving, immutable and 'absolute' in its 'quality'. This 'quality' of 'reflectivity' is also inherently pervasive in its total equanimity - it is totally ambivalent, indifferent, nonchalant and does not get involve with anything, just like a fly on the wall, for it cannot be bias in any shape manner or form. We now know that this is mind-consciousness in repose, like a pendulum at rest, is when mind-consciousness is 'not thinking' (verb). Third, we say that when the mind-consciousness, that is the 'illusion' or 'phantasm' of 'sunyata' that is 'emptiness', that is the 'quality' of the 'reflectivity' that is the 'backing' of a mirror, emanates itself in the worldly false ego of self in the 'samsara' of suffering, where the immutable law of karma is in full steam, it does so in the 'illusion' that is the kaleidoscopic phantasmagoria of worldly phenomena, and kindly note, ever-changing and therefore not absolute. This 'illusion' is like, (in contrast to that is the 'quality' of the 'reflectivity' that is the 'backing' of a mirror, which is absolute and never moves), the ever changing never absolute 'kaleidoscopic' 'reflections' 'in' the mirror. We now know that this is mind-consciousness in animated action, in full flight, like a movie, is when it is 'thinking' (verb). Fourth, the 'absolute' 'reflectivity' of and the 'non-absolute' 'reflections' in the mirror are neither 'form' (noun) nor ''not form' (noun) and are pervasive 'thinking' (verb) or 'not thinking' (verb). And they both metaphorically relate to and emanate from the same mind-consciousness. They are the two sides to the same coin, the same mind-consciousness. The 'absolute' 'reflectivity' of the mirror is like the pendulum of a grandfather clock at 'rest' and the 'non-absolute' 'reflections' in the mirror are like the pendulum of a grandfather clock 'in motion'. In Buddhism we describe the former as 'nirvana' [the mind-consciousness in peaceful blissful repose of 'not thinking'] and the latter as the 'agitated monkey in the mind' [the mind-consciousness animated and fantasising or should that be phantasming!] But as we can see, there is neither Self or God to be identified with or grasped of related to. And that is why it is as the Buddha said of the 'illusion', the 'phantasm' that is of 'sunyata' - that it is inconceivable, incomprehensible and ungraspable. Postscript. Please do not take Buddhism too seriously or should I say do not take it religiously. You do not have to trouble yourself with the metaphysical or the transcendental, or anything publicly broadcasted and vainly advertised as spiritual and pristine, when you are young and fancy free, and able to enjoy the full flight and the full spectrum of the multi-coloured and multi-weaving intricacies of the magic tapestry that is life. Be like an intrepid explorer - go and experience and enjoy life to the full - the sunshine and the rain, the different seasons, the ups and downs, the good with the bad. But keep a copy of the Desiderata beside you. That is the only Bible you ever need. To everything there is a season, the Bible says. The Buddha was more plebeian and mundane when he said - \"The mango will fall when it is ripe.\". Go and fall in love, raise a family, look after your aged parents, that is the true Zen (excuse the pun) for life! Wait until (a) you are absolutely unhappy and have lost faith of life - when you see it as 'suffering', as a burden, as a chore, as a gross inequity or as a 'Groundhog's Day' or when (b) you have been infected with a fear of 'death' all of a sudden or when (c) you have become 'Socrates' and is verve'd to know who exactly you are, the reason for your 'state' or 'lot' in existence, basically the 'who, when, what, where and whom' of 'you'?.

            "answer_text": "Have you ever wondered while watching a 3D film in a cinema that we see the pictures as having height, width and, crucially, depth when in fact it all originates from a flat 2D screen! Theoretical physicists say our 3D world may just be an illusion and that they have found substantial evidence to support the idea of a holographic universe. The difference, in our 3D universe, is that we can touch objects and the \u201cprojection\u201d is \u201creal\u201d from our perspective. Apart from this theory there are some more theories that relates to your question; Plato\u2019s Allegory of the Cave: Imagine a cave. In it, there are people who have been chained and are observing a blank wall. They can see, because of the fire, the shadows of themselves and of whatever is happening behind them. The voices echo in the cave while the shadows dance on the wall thus making the shadows appear real and talking. Plato compares us to those who are chained to the cave wall in his metaphor. He points out that we believe and think we see reality by watching the shadows on the wall. Whereas, beyond our perceived reality, there lies a world of \u201cperfect\u201d forms. Everything that we see is just a shade, an imitation of how things truly are. Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019 Solipsism: Have you ever experienced that you\u2019ve awoken from a dream, only to find out you are actually still sleeping? Dreams within dreams happen sometimes, in the REM phase of sleep. What if the reality as we know it exists only inside a dream then may be our minds could be confused by various deceptions. Descartes argues that if we cannot even tell for sure whether we are dreaming, then how can we know for certain any truth about the world in which we seem to live? The \u201cbrain in a jar\u201d thought experiment: Imagine that you are just a brain in a jar that is run by a higher power. How would you know? And can you truly deny the possibility that this is your reality? This is a question discussed by thinkers and scientists who, like most people, believe that one\u2019s understanding of reality depends solely on their subjective feelings. Conclusion: we cannot confirm the actual existence of anything except our consciousness. Time is an illusion\u200a\u2014\u200aEternalism: From philosophers to physicists, the nature of time has always inspired curiosity. The concept of time is simply an illusion made up of human memories, everything that has ever been and ever will be is happening right now. To answer the differences among the present, the past and the future, There are three competing theories. Presentists argue that only the present objects and present experiences are real, and we recognize this in the special vividness of our present experience. However, according to the growing-past theory, the past and present are both real, but the future is not real. The third theory is that there are no physical or objective differences among present, past, and future because the differences are merely subjective and come from us. This third theory is often called \u201cEternalism.\u201d Phenomenalism: Everyone is interested in knowing as to what happens to things when we aren\u2019t looking at them. Phenomenalism has a simple answer\u200a\u2014\u200athey disappear. Well, only because objects only exist as a phenomenon of consciousness. Quantum mechanics seem to favor phenomenalism. Quantum mechanics states that particles do not assume a specific velocity or position until they are observed. This strange behavior of matter particles would correspond with phenomenalism, since things would not exist in a definite form until observed. So, there is no existence without perception. The physical world exists only as sensory data in the perception of minds, and not as a substance or a thing in itself. ",

            "answer_text": "This metaphysical position is called solipsism, and for centuries it has succeeded in irritating a lot of people \u2014 not so much because it's wrong as because it's impossible to disprove! If you start with the assumption that everything is a figment of your imagination, then nothing you encounter can undermine that very assumption (by virtue of always being attributed to your imagination!). \"Oh sure you argue that you are not an illusion. But that's just what you would do, since you're a sneaky illusion.\" I read somewhere that solipsism is the \"end of philosophy\". I'm not so sure. Just because everything is a product of your mind doesn't mean you can control any of it.  I guess you could say there are two metaphysical extremes:  Radical Idealism: Everything is in the mind and objective reality is illusory, or at the very least not made of matter.Radical Materialism: Everything is matter and the mind is illusory/emergent/epiphenomenal. One version of this is called eliminative materialism, which holds that most/all of our common sense-ideas about the mind are false.In between these diametrically opposed forms of monism (everything is made of one kind of entity \u2014 either mind or matter), you find dualism, which is an equal-opportunity metaphysics. Mind (or spirit) and matter both exist, but their relationship status is \"it's complicated\".  I like to summarize my picture of materialism versus idealism with the following sentence:  For the materialist, psychology is a subset of physics; for the idealist, physics is a subset of psychology!  Another way to say it is this: For the materialist, atoms give rise to minds; for the idealist, minds give rise to atoms. Let me elaborate. Most people would agree that the phenomena we encounter are given. We experience things. Stuff happens. The disagreements emerge from the question of how to label the stuff. For mainstream scientists, objective reality is (at the very least) the subset of communicable experiences that can in principle be shared by the scientific community. In other words, reality is inter-subjectivity. If you have an experience that no one else shares, then that's basically an illusion or a hallucination. \"A lunatic is just a minority of one.\"  [Image via Intersubjectivity and Multiple Psychologies.]   The most reliable and reproducible inter-subjective experiences come from physics and chemistry labs. You will experience the verification of Newton's laws if you perform the experiments correctly. The reliability of physics and chemistry is part of the reason most scientists and educated lay people accept that atoms and molecules are real. If such concepts are not real then why are they so strikingly useful? The materialists want to construct a reliable theory of mind from solid foundations, so they try to put together a theory of how matter  \u2014 neurons and other brain cells  \u2014 act together to create subjective experience. (Working our way up from atoms is generally agreed upon to be both unnecessary and wildly impractical.)  However, the fact that subjective experience feels fundamentally different from the experience of external matter is one of the reasons many people remain dissatisfied with materialist accounts of consciousness. In the future we might come up with a materialist theory of how the mind works, but for now the mind is largely a blind spot for materialism. The radical idealists (of which the solipsist is perhaps the most extreme case) say that experience is all we can know, and that the solitary mind of the observer is ultimate reality. Physics is still useful however, because it (partly?) explains the otherwise baffling fact that certain \"illusory\" observations are actually quite reliable. If you use the equations correctly, you can predict the movements of various kinds of objects, from pendulums to planets. So the reliability of science becomes a blind spot for solipsism. (But maybe the solipsist feels no compulsion to explain why her illusions can occasionally be consistent and predictable. Science is just trickery from her illusion-loving mind.) In any case, behaving as if certain experiences are 'real' is probably useful even for the solipsist. Even if I think of my friends as illusions concocted by my mind, life would become very unpleasant indeed if I routinely treated my friends as if they were hallucinations. :)  In other words, whether you're a solipsist or not, if you want your experiences/illusions to be somewhat bearable, you're probably going to act in a way that's very similar to the non-solipsists. If you act too weirdly, the \"illusory\" authorities might put you in an \"illusory\" mental institution. That might not be the best way to experience the Great Illusion of being alive and conscious.  ",

            "answer_text": "Could life just be an illusion? To answer this question one must understand that by the time you're at the end of your formative years there are two of you in you. There's your real-self and then there's your ego-self. Your ego-self is a defense mechanism, self-developed to protect the \u2018\u2019information masquerading as knowledge\u2019\u2019 that you accepted as truth, without corroboration with your own knowledge of Truth,which you then stored in your subconscious mind, during your youthful and formative years. Your real-self is the real you which lies, deeply buried, underneath all the clutter that your ego-self has shoved in there, and allowed to pile up, unreviewed. So give your real-self a break, get that ego-self pile-of-stuff out of there. In consequence, you will become happier. You will have aha moments, of some indeterminate duration of the human concept of time, when you will experience happier-ness. And when you are attempting the accessing of your \u2018\u2019genius\u2019\u2019 capabilities, you can sequence a string of aha moments together whereby you will discover that the afterglow of the aha moment from before is used to increase the strength of the aha moment moment which follows, leading to those revelatory, nirvanic, experiences, which I call, the Whole Truth.(Nothing but the Truth, so help Your Truth.)(Amen). (no religious significance to the word amen, now is there, didn\u2019t it start out as a simple word to say thank you?) The illusion which creates your confusion is the illusion your Ego-Self throws in front of your more  accurate Real-Self\u2019s perception, therefore obfuscating the Truth from being more readily apprehended. Real Life is brimming with Truth and Beauty, and it is only the illusion created by your ego-self, which does not allow you to more fully access the daily event of the elucidation of Truth and Beauty.  Truth and Beauty are, regardless of whatever you, or another entity or individual (including me) thinks, says, or does. (as Parmenides made clear, 2500 years ago or so.) Seek Truth and Beauty, without being guided by another. (as Kant made clear 220 years ago or so.) I call it the Whole Truth, Einstein said this about the phenomenon, and called it the \u2018\u2019cosmic religious experience\u2019\u2019;  \u2018\u2019...there is found a third level of religious experience, even if it is seldom found in a pure form. I will call it the cosmic religious sense. This is hard to make clear to those who do not experience it, since it does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of god; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought. He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance... The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor god made in man's image. Consequently there cannot be a church whose chief doctrines are based on the cosmic religious experience. It comes about, therefore, that we find precisely among the heretics of all ages men who were inspired by this highest religious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints...\u2019\u2019  Albert Einstein,  Religion and Science (1930)  Originally written for the New York Times Magazine (9 November 1930)  When one understands every word of this quote (moderately abbreviated, (See Wikoquote)), one comes to understand the \u2018\u2019essence\u2019\u2019, the \u2018\u2019feeling\u2019\u2019, of the experience of which he speaks. The cosmic religious experience completely encompasses and expands the merely human concepts of a god or gods, spirituality, mysticism, magic, miracle, and a supernatural anything, into the Cornucopia of All Possibilities, thereby dissolving those heretofore mentioned human concepts into insignificance within the \u2018\u2019Wholistic Perspective\u2019\u2019 , within the \u2018\u2019Wholistic Feeling\u2019\u2019, gained by coming to understand the cosmic religious experience. (the Whole Truth) It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory, [not just scientific theory] is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.  Albert Einstein,  The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933) When one comes to the aha moment of understanding that the cosmic religious experience, the Whole Truth, is the Einstein's Razor regarding the entire religio-philosophical realm, then all other human concepts, by all the \u2018\u2019wise men and women\u2019\u2019, all the \u2018\u2019sages\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019seers\u2019\u2019, throughout all of human history, become admirably emulate-able, but incomplete, or misinformed, or misunderstood, attempts to elucidate the cosmic religious experience, the Whole Truth, for the benefit of humankind.  ...there are moments when one feels free from one's own identification with human limitations and inadequacies. At such moments, one imagines that one stands on some spot of a small planet, gazing in amazement at the cold yet profoundly moving beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable: life and death flow into one, and there is neither evolution nor destiny; only being.   Albert Einstein,  Letter to Queen Mother Elisabeth of Belgium (9 January 1939) Einstein succinctly attempts to explain that the cornucopia of all possibilities accessible within the cosmic religious experience, within the Whole Truth, is BEING, is to BE in the NOW moment. These NOW moments are called \u2018\u2019aha moments\u2019\u2019 of knowing, of understanding. The illusion is so incredibly blank compared to the reality of Truth. I am an everyman. If I can do it, anyone can. Stephen Kirby\t\t aha moment: from Dictionary . com 1.\ta point in time, event, or experience when one has a sudden insight or realization. Thehappierproject An online forum for the intellectual discussion of the processes of happier-ness. What you do after you read this is to think about it and figure out just what is your truth, your beauty, and then determinedly go about making it Your Truth. You will experience happier-ness, anytime, anywhere. And isn't that what life is all about? ",

            "answer_text": "Life exists on many levels. Some are real, some are just an illusion, it depends on your perspective. Take, for example, a stone. One the one level you can see, feel it, know its shape and its weight. It exists and it seems very solid and very real. But we all know that it's solid appearance is just an illusion. It is actually made of countless zillions of individual atoms, none of which are actually touching any other atom in the stone, they are merely tightly bonded with other nearby atoms. So it's solid appearance is really just an illusion. Further, those atoms are the smallest units of the substance that have the properties of the substance, but they are all actually made up of even smaller subatomic particles, none of which have the properties of the substance. So those atomic properties are just an illusion, from the perspective of a subatomic particle. But that subatomic particle is actually not a particle. It is just a tiny bundle of energy that exists on one level as a subatomic particle. Further, it is made up of even smaller units of very strange energy, having properties that don't always conform to the laws of normal physics that apply to it from the subatomic level and above. The subatomic particle is just an illusion from the perspective of the quantum world. Take, as another example, taste. You can pick up an apple, take a bite and taste the apple. You identify the taste and it seems real. But your perception of the apple\u2019s taste is just electrical signals from your tongue being interpreted by your brain. The electrical signals from your tongue were triggered by receptors on your tongue detecting certain chemical compounds in the apple, which your brain has learned are associated with the taste of an apple. Those chemical compounds are forms of matter, made up of subatomic particles, none of which actually have the property of flavor. On one level taste is real, but on another level it is just an illusion. Sound? On one level at least, it is just an illusion. It is nothing more than vibrating particles of air, vibrating in waves of soundless energy that your ear drums detect and then your brain tells you is sound, but is all just taking place in your head. Love? When we experience love, it certain feels very real and on one level it definitely is real, having very real impacts on our feelings, our decisions and our lives, but on another level it is just biochemical processes taking place within our brain. A trick of evolution that has evolved to help our species prosper. Thankfully, it still feels real and mostly feels good, whether it is actually a real thing or not. There is almost nothing in life that cannot be seen as just an illusion on at least one level, real on another. Whether you see things as real or just an illusion is your personal choice - both answers are correct. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow.  Your unconscious mind is pretty amazing. Go and listen to a Bach Partita, a Hendrix solo, or read an Eliot poem.  You made all that up?  Can you write another Shakespeare play please?  We can't get enough of those.  Or play one of Vilayat Kahn's sitar solos? Oh, you can't.  It's your unconscious mind.  You have no conscious access to it?  OK.  Let us know if you work out how though, it'd be kind of useful.  As it happens, you can only get access to a very small number of each of these great works, and only when you read an imagined book, or listen to an imagined CD.  When those aren't available, you lose access to them, as you through a small and imperfect memory?  Sounds like your unconscious mind is pretty walled off from the rest. You hold the thoughts, loves, hopes and fears of every one of the 8 billion humans in your unconscious?  Well done.  That sounds hard.  All the instincts and semi-consciouness of the animals, insects, bacteria and plants on the planet.  Their inner workings down to the molecular level?  Gosh, go you. How did you come to imagine the nightmarish horrors of the Ichneumonidae wasp, starvation, childhood leukaemia or the North Korean gulags?  You decided that Junko Futura should be tortured to death?  Not sure I like your mind much.  Could you stop doing this sort of crap please?  Oh you can't control this part of your mind either?  OK, definitely let  us know if you work out any level of control -- I've a big list of shit I'd like you to stop doing.   But then again, your mind control the motions of every celestial body in the observable universe?  Could you tell us what dark matter and dark energy are?  There's lots of people in your imagination who you are imagining would love to know.  Good job keeping track of those 1080 atoms, and all their interactions according to the yet unknown laws of physics.  Again, sounds pretty difficult.   So let's recap.  Your unconscious mind is inaccessible to you (except through sense perception), it is uncontrollable by you (except through normal interactions via your body), and it is incomprehensible to you (except in tiny pieces, through your conscious mind), its abilities and complexity is at least isomorphic to the complexity, structure and law-likeness of the thing we used to call the universe.  I also can't see why its survival should be linked to that of your body and conscious mind: certainly it seems to be separated from them in every other way there is.  It gives the illusion of having been working for 13.6 billion years before your birth, and it at least gives the illusion that it will carry on working for billions of years after your death too. You know, I think I'll just rename this unconscious mind of yours.  I'll call it \"the universe\".  I find myself under the illusion (no doubt created by your unconscious mind) that this renaming makes no difference at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Life is interesting. It can be as real as we want it to be so the answer is yes and no. If you take your current physical aspect, it may sound real but I have another take on it: The temporary existence and the mysterious purpose with our being is not just a biological evolution. We are recycled again and again whether as lifeless substance or as a living being. We are the remains of this grand creation, something someone created, or maybe we just exist. Just think what if there would be nothing, no Earth, no Universe, no Space anything at all. What would it be like if there was nothing? In my younger years I used to believe I came from this nothing; my mind used to sink back and forth from something to nothing; but living years and years on earth, surviving this long here later changed my perception of our Being as a part of a divine something that mattered and had a greater purpose. However, after so many thoughts, and life time of experiences I now believe that our present life we see is just a visual memory of our past that is being replayed time after time long after we were gone, and all that is happening is the past repeating in that moment which is no more real. It\u2019s like a Mr. Nobody watching the stored energies of all things that happened some billion years ago and trying to make sense of it. That Mr. nobody is you, either a spectator, or a protagonist or something else. It is only being replayed inside itself exactly like a vibe we leave in a room after laughter or a serious conversation and move on, leaving the energies, they have nowhere to go but relive in it. But the reality of it is that it\u2019s a vacuum and nothing material exists. Our present is similar to that. We, our physical us exists no more, we are long gone, and nothing matters, that is why we know nothing matters in the end and that sounds truer to us than \u2018life after death\u2019 or anything for that matter. We cannot take ourselves so seriously but just let it go and let it be. The reality of us is in good place somewhere else, and it\u2019s being taken care of. \u2018Now\u2019 is just for us to see. There\u2019s so much confusion and mystery about who we are and our purpose in this lonely planet Earth in this Universe, but not single valid proof of what\u2019s there before and after life and all those theories written and told by people who have been here like us are all but speculations. I will update again if I find a true answer to this, if ever in this life. ",

            "answer_text": "Krishna says: Those who are seers of the truth have concluded that of the non-existent [the material body] there is no endurance and of the eternal [the soul] there is no change. This they have concluded by studying the nature of both. (Bg. 2.16) So according to Krishna's definition, reality is that which is eternal and unreality, or illusion, is that which is temporary. Note that illusion does exist, but it is unreal in the sense that it's not eternal. Someone may object - if I smash my head into a wall, the pain I feel is very real. How can it not be real? But if seen in the light of eternity it is not real. Illusion exists, but the reason it is not considered real is because it is not eternal. It's like a dream. A dream happens, but when we wake up, we understand it was not real. Life in a material body is like that - dream-like. We'll realize that, if not before, then at the time of death. Death will be a rude awakening for the atheist. So reality and illusion is defined by time. One is eternal the other is temporary. And if you think about it, it makes sense. Anything seen in the light of eternity will be manifested for such a short time, that it is as if it didn't really happen. Brahma, the god of creation, is said to live as long as the universe lasts - which is calculated to be 311 trillion solar years. So if you live for such an unfathomable length of time, then imagine what a person's life-span on earth of, say, 80 years must look like. I don't even live for a second from Brahma's point of view. How real would a person be to you if he existed for only a second? Think about it. If you take 80 years out of 311 trillion years it is such a miniscule portion of time, that for all practical purposes it might as well not have happened. But then, if you take Brahma's lifespan and compare it to eternal time, it is just as little. However long time is taken out of eternal time, it will still amount to nothing. The duration of the universe will make a lifespan on earth seem completely insignificant, and the cosmic time of millions, billions, and trillions of years seem totally inconsequential and insignificant from the point of view of eternal time. So from the point of view of eternity, anything that is not eternal is but an illusory glimpse. That's how one can understand that anything which has a beginning and an end is illusory. Only that which is eternal is real. Now, in this world, what is then real, someone might ask. We don't have any experience of something that lasts forever, do we? Yes we do. The only thing, that lasts forever is the soul - ie. consciousness. The soul is eternal, so in the material world the only real thing is the soul, everything else is temporary and thus illusory. That's why self-realization, according to Vaishnava theology, means to realize one's eternal self beyond the temporary body and mind. Krishna gives a brilliant argument in the Bhagavad Gita to help a thoughtful person experience his eternal self. A person's body goes through different stages of infancy, childhood, youth, old age and finally death. But during all these changes of the body and the mind, the self (the inner sense of I-feeling) or the inner observer remains constant. That's one way we can logically understand we are eternal. The human life-form is unique in the sense that it allows the self to understand its own eternality. So the purpose of human life is to connect with the eternal self. If one is simply absorbed in the body and its demands, one is wasting this valuable opportunity - an opportunity that is only available in the human life-form. Eating, sleeping, mating and defending, the soul can do in any life-form, but only in the human form can the self connect with eternity, ie. reality. Krishna says: Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be. (Bg 2.12) As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change. (Bg 2.13) I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible. (Bg. 7.25)  ",

            "answer_text": "Well, whose illusion is it, really? You see, the conception that existence is an illusion is called Solipsism. \"All experience is merely a concoction of the mind, and once I disappear or the mind disappears, it will all go away.\" But the problem with this is that, again, whose illusion is it really? Is it the Humans'? The rocks', the trees' , the cells'? The planet's illusion? The universes'? Who is bringing it all up? What? The answer to this, is merely that all of them do it. Together. If we realize that we, existence, everything, is the conjunction of all the illusions of all things, then it gets really clumsy to believe that if the \"I\" would disappear, then everything would do so as well. All things act up to conform reality. They all do so at this very moment. If you were to disappear, the only thing that would happen is that you would be entering another game being brought up by other things. You leave the game of the \"Human\", which all things were exerting, to get into the \"Rotten flesh buried in the ground (maybe?)\" game. Or the \"Ashes\" game, whatever floats your boat in that particular time that you die. (Or rather, transform). When we realize that we all are the conglomeration of so many things, it is also easy to realize that there is also no objective observer of things. Who would it be? Who is the watcher? Maybe there is just the watching. And that if the \"I\" watches, then that implies a watching from beetles, or maybe from another species in another planet far away from here, who both watch things from an entirely different perspective from us, and might even escape the perception that we sometimes believe is absolute. Once you realize that things inter-depend all the time, you realize that the fact that we are here helps that the other things are there. And vice-versa. Therefore, the illusion of life is already being brought up by the other illusions of the other things that conform life. What you are is a process, a verb from an infinite amount of things, which all act up to reproduce the pattern which you are as a being. You do not live experiences. You ARE the experience. Life, the universe, existence, whatever you call it... is no illusion. It is a thing that likes to dance around and employ different movesets so that a human suddenly is reproduced, a rock is reproduced, stars too, and all the universe too is reproduced. All things take their respective turns, and when cells work together to do so, suddenly a process from a brain comes up and says \"that's me!\" and then it fades off, then on, and off again. If you can identify with all these changing of games, then the illusion becomes real, and you discover that the answer to your existence was lying hidden beneath all of the conceptions of the imagery that conciousness likes to create. Sometimes it's good to listen to the unconcious to find the answers that will break the illusion of life. Man won't find the answer to his existence in the cerebration, in what thinks, but rather, in that which does not think. So in short: Life COULD be an illusion if you want it to be. If you break away from the conjectures that we humans impose upon it, and begin to feel reality as is, without applying all sorts of cerebral filters upon it, we will slowly learn to receive the present moment in all its rich beauty, and be released from the Human perspective of things. That might be the first step of eventually reaching what could be called a Universal perspective. Anyways, that's my viewpoint ,which inevitably depended on the points of view from other things that are not me to be constructed (see!? :D), so I hope I was clear enough to be understood, and hope I was able to help in some way with the question. Have a great day! And see you soon! =) Mau ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, without a doubt. Only the non-philosophical pseudoscientific (real scientists, including quantum scientists accept this as possibility) mind believes otherwise. Even many religions (Buddhism has this as one of the main ideas known as the \u201cdesire realm\u201d, Taoism has something called the \u201cholograph\u201d, and it is a common viewpoint of Hinduism that we reincarnate for the specific purpose of learning how to overcome the world we see) acknowledge this. In fact, the very second story in Genesis, we are given an image of a man and woman in a garden until they eat a fruit and are banished. Because so many people read the Bible literally, let\u2019s go over this case by case. A man named Adam (\u201cred/clay\u201d or \u201cto make\u201d) and a woman named Eve (\u201clife\u201d) are created in garden that between four rivers, some or which either don\u2019t seem to exist or the location of them is so far away as to suggest that Eden itself is a metaphor for the Earth as a united region. So \u201cTo Make\u201d and \u201cLife\u201d, who can only do their real purpose when put together, are placed on the Earth, only it is a different Earth than the one we know of. How is it different? Well, until they eat of a Tree of Knowledge of Good/Evil they are effectively in a huge forest with waters flowing through and 100% fertility and plants/animals/fish/birds that they name. Notice anything sketchy here? (1) Why are they give the task of naming life? (2) How can they legitimately be tempted by anything if they have no idea what either good or evil is? They are told don\u2019t do something without understanding what the concept of don\u2019t or cause and effect even means. In other words, two concepts created by God become living beings in a world that is monistic (things just are, with no moral split) and are banished as a result of a fruit that changes their thinking to dualistic (good/evil moral split). None of these events are anything but an illusion playing out. The illusion is that they did something wrong, that they were judged by anyone but themselves, and the entirety of separation between Adam and Eve, Creation and God, good and evil, and so on. ",

            "answer_text": "YES AND NO Yes Part\u2014\u2014 \u201cReality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.\u201d - Albert Einstein  Because\u2014 Our beliefs, thoughts, faith, emotions and perceptions are illusory most of the time. Those are generated within the mind based on our conditioning and training. Let\u2019s look inside this: Mind:- A specific pattern of neurons inside the brain, which creates during the usage of our five senses organs. If you read some good books on capitalism advantage just for one month then you will start to love capitalist system and will criticize other economic system, on the contrary if you read some good thesis of Karl Marx, you will criticized capitalism like anything. Read some good books on the \u2018Humans are Alien\u2019 just for one month, you will feel that human are aliens on the earth. Same concepts applied with the religion, people who follow, hear, attend a specific religious domain, on the superficial level, criticized the other for the sake of their superiority, most of the conflicts in the world are due to this fake illusion. As Marx said \u201c Religion and Religious Ethos works like Opium for the masses.\u201d So conclusion is that when we follow or read something or like somebody just for one month fully hearty, then our thoughts control by that concept or person, further this will lead to a belief formation and faith in that concept, and finally our emotions will connected with that concept or person, and now we see the world with that perception only. So in a year this can happen 12 times and in a average life span of 70 years, a normal human being can see the world form 840 different ways and now multiply this with 7 Billion people, So billions of perceptive realities exist for this world. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND\u2014\u2014 No Part Our Physical and Mental acts, Creations, relations, natural acts are not illusory at all. All the acts which human execute are real and no one deny in this, Such as development of child in the mother womb, Terrorist attacks, mass violence, beautiful creations, love making, violence, volcanoes, atmosphere, etc etc\u2026. This is real\u2026.  So this is\u2026..  But Famous scholars, scientists, scriptures, religious texts define this world as a \u201cMAAYA\u201d- Illusion in itself. Why? Why \u2018self realized one\u2019 always talk about the illusions of life\u2026.Why?? According to me, they saw world differently than others due to expansion of their subconscious mind, they saw world in multiple planes(Dimensions) which is not possible for a normal human being and they understood minute change of nature/Reality very easily than others. As Buddha said- \u201cIn this world everything is changing, only the notion of change is static.\u201d Even when you will finish the reading of this article, You are not same as the 3 min ago, \u2018n\u2019 number of cells have died and created. Albert Einstein understood that the space between us is vary w.r.t. to time, due to the impact of gravitational waves, but for normal people, we can not imaging that the distance between to us is vary w.r.t. to time, because it seems constant for us always. Even after 100 years we are proving it. Those people understood the basic universal energy ( Energy that Is playing the whole universe) that is resides in everybody in their subconscious mind. So when they see through this energy, their perception of reality was different than us and the concept of MAAYA/Illusion emerged. Final Conclusion\u2014 Perception of Reality is an Illusion, Action on that Perception is a Reality. ~ Yogendra Sharma Thanks for reading\u2026Keep sharing..:) YS ",

It is not about human rights or opportunity though\u2026I am just saying the world that we see all the day, the sunrise or sunset is all have became the simple politic rubbish.The day is repeating with no new coming up.How can we say the meaningless is the awuful thing and refuse the illusions?Then I say illusion is no t to blame for those suck.what is illusions? Literuture?post-modern philosophy? A crazy painting?It is something cannot be indentify, something changes itselfs just like a bend line. A river bend to everywhere. In other words ,Illusion is all we want and all we want to be. Love, dreams or those sweat are illusion ,yes,but how to make it real is to break the reality .Then we will ask what is reality. Is it really important to set up a real-reality inside ?It is not needy to find a world below the world right here and traps in the new logic problems. No more reality , belive,enjoy your illusion,that is the right way and way to the great revolution!!!No belif to trust and only trust your own illusion!!If there is no illusion then we just fight for it!!The right we deserve is the right to dream!!!!

            "answer_text": "No, everything that happens is not just an illusion made up by your unconscious.  Reality happens. Your perceptions, however, can be illusory. Tom Margolis had a great answer here that covered a number of limitations of the sensory suite that we use to engage the world. \"There is no blue...\", he said. This reminded me of the Matrix line, \"There is no spoon\".  We use a hugely limited set of sensory organs to interact with the world - sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. We perceive a tiny fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum when we \"see\" what's out there. We perceive a tiny fraction of all the vibrations in the air when we \"hear\". And we take it for granted that other animals can smell things that we simply can't. We then use these limited perceptions to build a model - a conceptual framework to better understand what's out there - what is real. But the model can be an illusion. Centuries ago, it was reasonable to model reality as a central earth with a sun that revolved around us, rising and setting. But science proved that this perception was an illusion - not the reality of it but the perception of it. Science continues to enable us to chip away at the limitations of our senses, bringing new perspectives on reality (e.g., radio astronomy, atomic scale imaging) into our narrow realm of perception. We expand the model, inching ever closer to the real. Our senses and therefore our perception of reality have evolved to give us a fair chance of survival in a dynamic and often hostile world. They are by no means perfect, they're not even the best, but, as Tom said, they're good enough to get by. ",

            "answer_text": "Life beyond our consciousness is real; life as seen by our consciousness is partially an illusion, and the consciousness itself is a complete illusion, a parallel product of the mind. Everything which is non-physical is an illusion; everything seen through subjectivity, which is always biased, is partially real, but everything that exists independently of perspective, and does not need perspective in order to exist, is real. That way, atoms, germs and astrophysical happenings are definitely real; they do not need to be seen by us for them to be real; they are real regardless of our perspective towards them. Text, speech and every other form of communication - these are hybrids of reality and illusions; they exist beyond our minds but a full understanding depends on one\u2019s consciousness - the consciousness that either generates or receives the communicative form. We are ourselves half real and half illusory, as our complex physical functions allow the evolution of the illusions projected from them and the body that inhibits them. Opinions, values, beliefs, individual and collective identities - these are all subjectivity, and subjectivity is an illusion, as these do not exist beyond the illusions of our minds, and are the sole products of perception. Once one separates independent reality from pretentious illusion, life may become less vivid than before, as much of an individual\u2019s excitements (and the opposite as well) originates from illusions. However, this distinguishing shall get one closer unto discovering truths which are more than personal, but potentially universal as well - a sacrifice worthwhile for those who seek to elevate themselves beyond the illusory barriers of normativity, at the sake of having less life-force and a more silent lifestyle. Become sober from subjective bias, and your heart shall be less happy, sad or anything else of emotion, but your mind shall expand into new horizons, previously unimaginable. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is. It\u2019s all about what we perceive. There is nothing called life, people, universe, water, nature..nothing absolutely. It\u2019s all perception. Let me explain. We see water or some towel wet with water. But is it really wet ? If we take a microscope, we will see cotton fibers of towel drenched in water. If we dig deeper using electron microscope, we see water molecules over cotton fiber molecules. If we still dig deeper, all we see is atoms of Hydrogen and Oxygen (water). Now, are atoms wet ? No. They are not. Still if we dig deeper we will find electrons and proton within these atoms. Still dig deeper and may be some strings from string theory . This is essentially some form of Energy. What does it all mean? Wet is not wet. We only perceive it. ABSOLUTELY everything imaginable in the universe if nothing but energy. There is nothing like emotions, happiness, sadness. Feelings are nothing but some neurons are firing within brain \u2192 Some chemical reactions \u2192 Atoms and Molecules \u2192 Energy. Imagine dog poo on the table besides exotic french perfume. What\u2019s the difference? Nothing\u2026It\u2019s just different set of molecules. We don\u2019t like smell of dog poo simply because our brain is PROGRAMMED to hate the smell of that particular molecular combination. At absolute level, it boils down to energy/atoms. So, what are we doing? Are we real ? To Nature (or God if any such power exists) humans are no different than a rock on Jupiter. Why we humans consider ourselves as intelligent ? Are we really? No\u2026it\u2019s just our PERCEPTION that we are intelligent species. We think that we see the moon, sun and can control nature on earth. We buy those expensive cars and feel great. But it\u2019s actually nothing than trillions of atoms buzzing around !!! What do you think ? (Your thinking doesn\u2019t make sense and so my blog \u2026but I think we have to live in this \u201cPerceived World\u201d as a programmed toys !!) ",

            "answer_text": "Life is an illusion in the sense that the scenes in life appear fleeting, which paves the way for a philosophical inquiry into the nature of things. We look for permanence that lie beyond the apparitional nature of forms. Life as it it unfolds is an illusion. From moment to moment, scenes change. Are we the same person from moments ago before we breathe in and out different molecules of air? Is our existence the same from moment to moment? We need to get to the principles which lie beyond the realm of manifestation. The realm of manifestation is an illusion. Form changes and is not permanent. On the other hand, the principles that make life possible is immutable and is not an illusion. If we define our existence in terms of the materials that it is comprised of, then our point of view fail to reach the level of principles of existence that lie beyond the material realm. In principle, only one point need exist that \u201cpulsates out\u201d the entire cosmos. The wave theory of the underlying structure of the cosmos is accurate. Waves are not particles and behave differently from particles. A failure to recognize the existence of the underlying structure of the cosmos ultimately leads to a systemic contradiction within one\u2019s world view. When we scrutinize the structure all natural objects, we find the pervasiveness of a certain definite structure. This structure is based on geometry. Geometry is independent on all contingent factors that lie within the realm of manifestation. This geometry paves the way for the realm of manifestation to be exhibited in the cosmos. It\u2019s main characteristics are stability and integrity. It\u2019s got style too. It is aesthetically pleasing to look at. GIF flower of life  The above figure shows the immutable geometry of the cosmos that stands above all scientistic and social contingencies. Lots of people have seen or come across the above geometric figure before. It uses elementary shapes as a basis for its construction. The geometric figure is a reflection of the underlying unity which belies the cosmos and pervades through its entirety. No, life is not an illusion in the sense that would encourage a wanton outlook. Life is to celebrate the underlying unity that lie beneath the myriad of forms. In other words, we are witnesses to a great design. So celebrate its rhythms and reflect its integrity as much as possible. ",

            "answer_text": "We have been conditioned to interpret life through our thoughts. You might say that we live in a \u201cthought-world\u201d rather than the world as it is. This is an extremely limited way to perceive the world. Our physical sensations are also quite limited. Our eyes can only see a limited spectrum of light that is available. We cannot see the infrared spectrum for instance. Our hearing and sense of smell is very limited even compared to that of our pet dog. If we could see what an electron microscope sees, we would see that what we consider solid form is actually mostly empty space. So our perceptions are very limited and then we interpret those perceptions through very limited conditioned thoughts. We could call this extremely limited perception illusion. To help free us from this illusion we can begin a number of practices that help us expand our conscious awareness. The main one is to simply stop focusing our attention on our thoughts for just a moment. Anyone can do this if you\u2019re willing to. For just a moment have your thoughts be the least important thing in your life. Allow them to come and go as they do, but stop giving them any attention. Notice also that in your room in addition to all the object (walls, window, door, desk, chair, your body) there is also space that all these objects appear in. We usually don\u2019t focus on space and so have forgotten it\u2019s even here. Once you place your attention on it, you realize it has always been here. Of course it has. Now instead of the objects, focus on the space that all these objects appear in, including your body. You may begin to experience that there is also space inside your body, the same space as is outside your body. Simply noticing space, what is always here, your awareness is expanding. You are aware of more than before. Your perceptions are less limited than they were before. Now you may want to notice something else. You could not be aware of space, the objects in your room, your body, or your thoughts without awareness itself. Here\u2019s something else you have probably not directed any attention toward. This is an even larger expansion of your attention. There is space and there is awareness. And the experience of them is beyond thoughts. You don\u2019t need thought to be aware of space or awareness. In fact, thoughts will only limit your experience of space and awareness. This is not the whole picture. But it is far more than most humans experience of life. It is a start, a beginning to see more of what is here. Try it yourself. It is simple. As you continue expanding your awareness of what is here, you will depend less on your thoughts to interpret what you\u2019re experiencing. You will begin to realize that your thoughts can only limit your experience, not expand it. Thoughts have their place. They have their use and value. But as an interpreter of life and reality they are extremely limited. When we spend just a moment free of attention on thoughts, this becomes very clear. So much more opens up to us. We can have many thoughts and theories about what life is an illusion means. But these also limit our understanding. They don\u2019t expand it. To understand what this means, we must have a direct experience of something more than this illusion. And you can do it. Try it and see for yourself. ",

If you will observe carefully ,every person is somehow and somewhere trying to collect help from people so that he/ she can move ahead in life today everyone is busy in building their life, you too ? or you are helping them in building theirs ? Fool are those persons who help others without any reason or not being capable to help them. Even am writing this because i love to write and i can enhance my writing skills at the name of helping you.(Please don\u2019t take me wrong try to understand and read further ) Everyone is around you because you have some utility for them, Stop helping your friends and you will come to know that life is an illusion however we do/may have some loyal friends but they are exceptions because exceptions are everywhere, But even friendship also have certain limits because none of your friend will pay for you food expenses for whole life. So live your life and try to be with yourself you will only feel alone when you will leave yourself and will rush for your friends. ( Am not saying you to stop meeting them but never leave youself i.e If you want to or else enjoy with your friends.) ",

What you have been living / going through is your reality! While what others have been projecting could may be an illusion for you! But you never know that Nature Can make your wildest dreams to come true! So have faith and trust in GOD (humanity), it can make possible anything and all ! And can change your reality anytime if HE has written it on HIS wall! You may kind of having in life no pitfalls! \\ While others will be crying throughout the year especially in the summers and in fall! One day they are all gonna crawl! While you may be achieving everything & enjoy all ! So have a great time when playing bat and ball ! This is the story of Mr. Faisal Haider who has done a lot! He is so good that he doesn't give anyone a shot! While reciting his epic poetry a lot of times! he sometimes crosses the line! but GOD says don't worry child you will be fine! No one can touch you as you are mine! And you will reach to all of your places in life in your designated times! So now you can ask people what they have been smoking ?

            "answer_text": "If life is an illusion, that would suggest that something else is real. Death? If life is not an illusion, then it is real. So, you have a choice. Either life is an illusion, in which case, something else is real, or life is not an illusion, in which case, it is real. If life is an illusion, is death real? But, death is part of life, so it cannot be real. Whatever is real must not be life. What, then, is real? Whatever we say is real seems to be a part of life. But if we say, everything is an illusion, nothing is real, this does not make sense. For something to be an illusion, that means something else is real. Let us go back to the idea that nothing is real. Can nothing be real? If nothing is real, everything is an illusion. But for something to be an illusion, there must be something real. If nothing is real, there can be no illusion. Furthermore, if everything is real, there can be no illusion. Yet, part of reality is that there are illusions. Everything cannot be real. Some things are illusions. What is real and what is illusion? To say that something as generalized and vast as life is an illusion creates great difficulty philosophically, as I have shown. Rather, it is better to be more particular in distinguishing real and not real. Hone your definition of what you mean by life. Life is reality and illusion. Resolve this paradox, and you will have an answer to your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Horses, Souls, and Time I was eight and at my first parade. I had never seen a horse before. But there they were, six magnificent and unbelievably huge animals pulling a wagon of beer, or so said my father. \"Those are horses,\" said my father. \"Do you like them?\" he asked. I couldn't answer, overwhelmed by their very _presence_, even more than by their size. Two months later a camp counselor showed me around the farm that would be my home for a month. \"And these are our horses,\" he said, pointing to three puny-looking animals in a pasture. \"Those aren't horses!\" I exclaimed, \"I saw some at the parade.\" A Clydesdale is a lot more horse than an Arabian, which is a lot more horse than a Shetland. The great differences in degree do not belie their common nature. Just so, the waking state, eidetic (intense, waking-like) dreams and hallucinations, and ordinary dreams evince great differences in degree, but all share a commonality. All these varieties of consciousness contain feeling and sensation in varying degrees of intensity. Throw in what used to be called OBE (Out-of-Body Experiences), now known as Lucid Dreaming, in which dream states are consciously controlled and often even more intense than the 'waking' state. I can tell I'm riding a Clydesdale, rather that an Arabian or Shetland. The differences in the experiences are great, but those differences in degree cannot logically be taken as a difference in kind. They are all horses. We can tell we are 'awake' and experiencing 'reality' rather than dreaming, usually, but the difference in content is one of degree. We recognize 'red', 'loud', 'pain', 'fear', 'nausea', 'hard', and a myriad of other sensations and feelings in all the varieties of experience. It is only differences in intensity that suggest a difference in kind from one variety to another, and that makes no more sense as a reason to think there is a qualitative difference than the difference between 'loud' and 'soft', which are a particular kind of difference in intensity, not kind. Yes, the sensations of the 'awake' state are overwhelmingly intense compared to those of common dreams. Usually. But rub your eyes and you will experience visual sensation that obviously has no correlate external to your apparent body. Eidetic dreams and hallucinations are overwhelmingly intense and can be distinguished from waking experience only by the rarity of their content, not by a difference in kind of sensation content. Hence, no variety of 'physical' sensation can be taken as evidence of the existence of a physical 'reality'. Hallucination and waking awareness are equally convincing in their intensity. All sensation, therefore, can be taken only as the evidence that something exists that experiences sensation, and the passage of time. The Relativity confusion has made it common in some circles to imagine that time does not exist except as a figment of our 'minds' and/or as a function of matter, but that illogic is enough to create reasonable doubt that there is an objective physical reality, in my opinion. How could real people imagine that something taking time to experience does not require the existence of time? How long does it take you to believe that time does not exist? Most of us have too little time available to waste it on imagining that time doesn't exist. Yes, we have only two givens in existence: time and something that experiences the passage of time complete with those other sensations and feelings that sometimes suggest a 'reality' that may be illusional. Time has a name that causes no one any emotional, logical, or philosophical problems. But what to call the stuff that experiences? \"Soul\" and 'spirit' have been around a long time but bring with them baggage stolen from the slums of delusion and illogic. Perhaps a new fabrication, a new coinage. How about 'edz', a simple fabrication that has no baggage? You may find some assumptions necessary. Number one may be the obvious: not just logic, but scientific method, works even if there is no objective reality. It is only consistency that is required in a given state of consciousness. My own other assumption is that 'I' am not the only soul or that I am just a part of a greater soul, much as a whirlpool is only a distinguishable part of a river. The physical assumption, that there is a physical reality behind the semblance, leads to an interesting possibility. Perhaps there is a More, and an Only. A More would be a person or other physical being 'inhabited' or otherwise associated with a soul. An Only would be a physical entity with no soul, which would possibly explain sociopaths and other 'unfeeling' persons. The sensory apparatus might report an injury or a pleasurable stimulus to the brain, but no resident soul would be present to experience the pain or pleasure. Are you a More? An Only?

            "answer_text": "Our experiences and ideas are not illusions, but are actually complex simulations. The word \"illusion\" implies misrepresentation, trickery, falsity, or deception. Existence is not trying to trick us. Existence just wants to go from a zero state of balance and absolute symmetry to max-Entropy. It is consciousness that is running the scam. And what a delicious scam it is! Living beings resist the zero and max-Entropy states so to extract the experience of enjoyment out of what is essentially nothingness. To that end, we have derived the material Universe. As live beings we simulate the world in terms of what is needed to survive and replicate our kind. Every single living being alive at this moment represents an unbroken thread of life spanning at least 3 billions years (possibly 9 billion years). Life represents the triumph of diversity of forms and optimization over uniformity and entropy. The astonishing fact that living forms have survived for over 3 billion years indicates that the perceptions made by living beings serve them very well. Our perceptions are effective despite the absurdities, glitches, and other imperfections we discover when we scrutinize them. So the big question in the life of a conscious living being is not illusion versus reality. Reality will always be derivable from illusion, and illusion will always be derivable from reality. The big question is, which values the highly conscious being will select? Once an hierarchy of values is selected by the conscious being, then the intelligent alignment of that being's actions with respect to the goals set by its values system can meaningfully begin. This alignment creates an intelligent consciousness acting meaningfully in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! When reality itself is an illusion, we do not need to ask any further questions. Illusion in no way means unreal, it simply signifies that what seems to be real is not, meaning a misinterpreted perception or experience. When Hindu sages during prehistoric times declared; all that exists is one, Brahman, which requires an atman (soul) to observe the same has now been accepted and clarified by Quantum Mechanics in science. The Copenhagen Interpretation accepts that everything is energy and that reality cannot exist, without an observer to observe the same. Reality is nothing but energy, and in reality it has no physical characteristics. These are merely waves and particles of pure energy occupying empty space. It further clarifies that consciousness,which is the result of observation needs to be first aware to observe, perceive and conceive all that we see as physical, and for that an observer is a must. The Hindus refer the same to as \u201cThe Witnessing Consciousness\u201d. Therefore, Quantum physics has shown that the physical space and the Universe, we see and observe, in fact is not, what it seems to be, meaning physical. The molecules, atoms, protons, electrons and neutrons; the building blocks of physical mass actually have no physical presence, but simply exist as energy. Deep into the sub-atomic realm, energy simultaneously exists both as a wave and a particle depending entirely upon how it is observed by any observer. Hence, the more we discover about the sub-atomic kingdom, the more we realize that everything in our life is just an illusion. ",

In effect, you have just discovered that you are \"naked\"; and I want to know (although I am not God), \"Who told thee that thou wast experiencing an illusion\"? Before I get downvoted and cast into the Outer Darkness of collapse, consider these theories that real scientists and real philosophers are proposing may very well be true:  Simulation hypothesis; Simulated reality. Now, if I were to tell you that I know we are, in fact, on a simulated Earth in a simulated Universe, having, in effect, a dream in our eternal brains for the benefit of gaining new experiences and increasing our enjoyment with being who we really are, I think you might believe me, but others will not.   But because YOU asked the question, and not the many who will dislike my response (which I don't direct to them, but rather to YOU), I will say that I do know that you and I and the others are experiencing what I call the Game of Life; we are enjoying what Nick Bostrom called the third option of the hypothesis:  that we are, in deed, in a simulation.

            "answer_text": "And if life is an illusion, does that make it any less real? From an existential perspective: does the fact that the experience may be imaginary make it any less valid? Pain is pain, fear is fear, and pleasure is pleasure. There is no denying that we interpret the world psychologically. Does it matter what percentage of it is psychological construct? Besides, the only way to answer this question is to push the limits of the illusion. You can only disprove an illusion externally. Nothing within a construct can defy the construct itself. Any self-denying proposition results in contradiction, which is logical impossibility. Because if the proposition disproves the construct, then the proposition itself is corrupted, negating its initial disproof. This, of course, is a paradox. It is therefore impossible that there exists a worldly proof that disproves the world. Hence the only way to disprove our reality is by exiting it. And death is the only way to escape life. It's possible that life is an illusion, but are you willing to bet your life on it? Whether or not life is an illusion is a question that can only be answered in death. It is also a question that can only by answered by the individual, because the dead seem disinclined to share their knowledge with the living. Your question intrigues me, but I'm willing to postpone my curiousity for a couple of decades, or so. I'm young, and my bucket list feels real. \u201c Life asked Death, \u201cWhy do people love me and hate you?\u201d Death replied, \u201cBecause you are a beautiful lie and I\u2019m a painful Truth.\u201d \u201d ",

For example, knowledge can increase, enabling us to find ways to heal people and make life a little easier and more comfortable. However, secularism also has huge downfalls. Today\u2019s generation are plagued by the why syndrome. They always want to know why something is or something isn\u2019t. A lot of the time, it\u2019s like that simply because it is. This can lead us down a slippery slope of searching for answers to questions that didn\u2019t need to be asked in the first place. That\u2019s when we get lost. When we start to ask why about basic parts of life, we are essentially being philosophers. That\u2019s when we come up with all sorts of theories about topics such as is life real, what is the purpose of life. We come up with isms like hedonism in order to explain, or at least attempt to explain (and rationalise), what is obvious. That is where religion comes in. True religion is an accurate and unquestionable account of what is and what isn\u2019t. It tells us what to think and what to believe. It tells us what to do and what not to do. The point here is this: nothing in this world is an illusion. Everything is planned and controlled. Nothing is happening by chance. We are not living in a simulation, or have our brains in vats. We are living in the real world, with real things happening all around us. ",

I find that sort of beautiful.  The very acknowledgement that we are unified only in our utter incomprehension of our own identity, that we have nothing and are nothing, except each other.  That's dreamy and lonely and terrifying and wonderful. To me it's also the essence of Love (which I also happen to think is quite real). Love - n.  the state of having absolutely no philosophical or meta-empirical idea who or what we are, but knowing with certainty that we are, at least, each other and everything else.  Go humans.

            "answer_text": "Is our known reality just an illusion? Lets take this apart as any good Analytical Philosopher would do. Reality and Illusions are aspect and anti-aspect of Being (IS) along with identity, presence, truth and their duals. The idea that we know reality, identity, presence and truth is somewhat of an oddity. This is because Being has usurped the place of Knowledge in the Indo-european worldview. Being is suppose to be perduring, but it is actually knowledge that is perduring. It is fairly clear that Heraclitus who embraced change was more right than Parmenides who rejected change. Now the problem is that there are meta-levels of Being and that the aspects are different at each meta-level, and so to know the aspects we must know what the aspects are at each of the meta-levels of Being, i.e. Pure, Process, Hyper, Wild, and Ultra. \"Our\" of course refers to the Mitsein, i.e. the inauthentic masses lost in the mundane who have not yet realized that they are in fact dasein, i.e. something deeper than subjectivity/objectivity dualism. Given this analysis we can say that if we do not know what reality is at all the meta-levels of Being, i.e. Pure Reality, Process Reality, Hyper Reality, Wild Reality, and Ultra Reality and its opposite at each level, i.e. illusion, [and include in that all the other aspects and their opposites (truth, identity, presence)] then we can never tell whether the reality blends with the illusion or not. We have to make a non-nihilistic distinction at every level, and that becomes harder at every level because it is harder to think at each level. Reality and Illusion become more intertwined at each level. So basically reality IS illusion and illusion IS reality, because Being itself is really absurd in itself at the level of Ultra Being where it becomes a singularity. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \"illusion\".  If you mean it to say that all of reality is purely in your head, then this is not a particularly useful way of looking at it.  The universe in every apparent instance follows a set of tightly constrained rules, possibly so constrained as to be deterministic.  Mental processes don't do that.  While it is conceivable that some overwhelmingly complex and invisible process is forcing your mind to conceive a universe with these rigid rules, the result is indistinguishable from a reality independent of your head, at least until somebody turns up evidence to the contrary.  Nobody has, and since the assumption that it could leads nowhere, it's not a helpful line of speculation. But if you mean \"illusion\" as in \"reality is very different from what it appears to be\", the answer is undoubtedly true.  Human beings live their lives in a very narrow patch of circumstances (a certain temperature, a certain gravity, speeds relative to each other very low, able to directly observe things over perhaps a couple of dozen orders of magnitude compared to the hundreds, thousands, or more available).  Your brain interprets the universe with respect to these expected circumstances, but experiment shows that the universe behaves very differently outside of them. Unfortunately, discussion ends there very quickly.  Philosophers are welcome to maunder about illusion, but ones who wish to achieve something must study physics instead.  While physics is very different from what we expect, it's not arbitrary; it's still objective and reliable.  You won't know how the subjective interacts with the objective if you're using only your narrow, intuitive view of what the objective is. ",

            "answer_text": "Is everything we see around us just an illusion? An illusion is something that deceives by producing a false or misleading impression of reality. For me there are two ways at looking at this question. One is that what we see, hear, taste, sense, etc. is different from what is reality. Two, everything is an illusion but what difference does it make since it is close enough to reality for us to function. First, let us look at what we see. Light enters are eyes as electromagnetic radiation. Visible light is defined as the wavelengths that are visible to most human eyes. By most estimates, we can only see about 0.0035% of the electromagnetic spectrum (that includes gamma rays, radio waves, x-rays, infrared, ultraviolet, microwaves, etc.). So to start with we only see a very small portion of the EM band. After entering the pupil, the light passes through the lens and it strikes the retina. Retina is made of light sensitive cells called rods and cones. Rods and cones detect the color and then change images into signals that travel to the brain along the optic nerve. The small photoreceptor cells of the retina (the inner surface at the back of the eye) sense light and transmit impulses to the optic nerve. The optic nerve from each eye carries impulses to the brain, where visual information is interpreted. In the human eye, the optic nerve receives light signals from about 125 million photoreceptor cells via two intermediate neuron types, bipolar and amacrine cells. Then the neurons (nerve cells) communicate with the visual cortex by: An electrical signal travels down the axon.Chemical neurotransmitter molecules are released into the synapse.The neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptor sites on the \treleasing neuron and the second neuron.The primary visual cortex is divided into six functionally distinct layers, labeled 1 to 6. Layer 4, which receives most visual input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), is further divided into 4 layers. As you can see the information we see with our eyes is just a very small part of the electromagnetic radiation. After entering the eye, the electromagnetic radiation is changed into brain signals that are different from electromagnetic radiation. Then the brain processes the information before sending it for conscious processing. This could be the very definition of illusion because it is different then reality. What we hear is also changed into brain signals. Our brain must create a representation of the world for us. So, yes everything we see, hear, feel, etc. is an illusion but a very good illusion because we can do so very much with the information that we have received! ",

What we call our earth is not even a trillionth fraction of this infinite universe, we are just a tiny spec of dust... Vashnavites believe life is nothing but a dream of vishnu, when he blinks life disillusions in seconds.. one can also see Vishnu dream as metaphor of telling the world how big is universe and all our Happiness and Sorrows are momentary and zero infront of universe.. momentary like a cell born in human body and dies within seconds without us letting know its presence, similar with human life. Having said that, it is also true as long as we are in our Physical body we need to preserve it from possible harms. Imagine someone is rash driving the bike and met an accident and got injured, The pain will feel horribly real, then, you cant say it is just illusion, it will be misuse of scriptual sayings then. what i think myself as \u201cme \u201c is only a series of extention of identifications in my cognition. my physical body is just a byproduct of life because it has limitations so it has to follow some principles and guidelines to survive in this world. ironically, we have taken our identifications of physicality to a whole new level of madness.. See, the whole world is fighting, blaming each others, hating on each other.. they are living under the impression as if they are immortals.. Fighting for land as if person really going to return to possess the land after the death. Today, again Sun came on time, air is flowing at its pace, birds are chirping once again and your one nasty thought in mind and you decide world is a bad place to live. Why so? the reality is that your compulsive thoughts right now are at socially acceptable level of madness and you need to contemplate life in a more fundamental way. Ask your self very basic fundamental inquiry like who i am and what is my purpose ? this alone will help you to open many different dimensions of life. Atlast, I would say life is an illusion but it is an illusion of universe( Brahma) not your duty to decide.. you just have to keep in mind life is illusion so that you don\u2019t get blind in vicious hedonic treadmill of life.

Many people are prepared to entertain the idea that consciousness generates the appearance of a physical universe, but few want to entertain the horrifying possibility that it's all the product of a single person's mind. An instinctive reaction many people have is to say \"we can't possibly profit from thinking about this\". But that's not true; it's entirely possible that we might be able to devise a theory of physics around the idea one day. Historically there are many examples of philosophers who argued that God must exist, because life without God was unimaginable. Now we can totally imagine it and we regard them as slightly flaky, at least in the rigour of their logic. But perhaps in the future people (or one person!) will look back and think of our present attachment to the necessary existence of other people in the same way. I sort of hope not! For the sake of the sensibilities of the present era, it seems like it might be more productive to ask whether the universe could exist in our collective and individual minds. That might also be a productive line of enquiry and wouldn't require us to stare into the abyss.  In a more mundane sense, of course the past is somewhat a construction of your mind. Nothing ever happened in precisely the way that you imagined it, down to the last detail. And the point of view that each of us has is necessary deeply limited and imprecise.  Note that the past being made up by your mind would entail everything being made up by your mind, since everything you experience is in the past; even if you look at some object, it took some time for the rays of light to reach your eyes from that object. It takes time for sensations to travel up your nerves to your brain. And by the time you've actually considered your experiences, they're quite far in the past.  ",

But sense that I do not exist alone, other's too are the sole-doer of their actions. When the whole of the act is seen together, the sole-doer disappears; this is the illusive part of this experience; there's no sole-doer. It's a ghost-ship with no pilot, other than our thought. Our thoughts does not belong to us. We did not initiate the first thought so that we can say what follows is our choice. The sole will always crave for a unique identity, or a (real) feeling of presence. There are two opposites stretched to infinity, one that is the mind we think we have, a rational mind that can tell the difference. But for this mind to exist, it has to be build upon a base, so that it's realised. That base is the absolute opposite of a rational mind, it's insanity, delusion, darkness or non-sense. This opposite does not exist in a remote distance or vibration. It's the mind itself, the universe, or me and you. Without the sense of non-sense or delusion there can't be an opposite which is our questioning nature. I like to go with the part that it's such an awful journey, a pain in the () most of the time. But since that we came this far, there's no turning back.. We've had No Choice at all in this. We were created by the act of nirvana between our father and mother. There's no reason to be joyful, and become engaged in an intercourse. There's no rationality or reason in this other than pure joy and absence of mind. This is our creator. As we move to the other pole, we move towards the opposite nature which is pure consciousness, caring, logic and understanding, but very sad too (just the opposite to Nirvana)... ",

Its from our point of view if we believe then it\u2019s true if we don\u2019t then ix jus illusion and moreover we have come to stay here for a while just like a camp! At times when we are stabbed to death by ego,hatred,vengeance,criticism etc., Feelings and emotions we feel that world is falling apart! That\u2019s a kind of illusion btw! If you \u201cBelieve there\u2019s no illusion then u lead a normal life\u201d and if you \u201cThink there\u2019s illusion then you get the time to discover explore reach enlightenment!\u201d Everything in this world has been made to appear like what it has to and we have been made to see as such how the appear! Ix a game of nature to add illusion and to remove it,even if one component in our life goes missing then it wud be upside down! So if u see it as it is keep up with it if not explore it find it prove it! When you travel in the highways far away u see water but at that place it\u2019s not seen if u think ix Mirage then ix mirage,if you try to explore and find about it you develop by proving it! Hence ix only in your point of view to whether accept it as it is or accept as u wish! ",

            "answer_text": "We are mobile perceivers; our brains must make internal maps of external reality so we can navigate the physical and social terrain. Those maps of the social terrain we call personality and identity. These things are real in the sense that they are really there happening. But when a person learns that their maps are just maps and the reality outside of our minds is very different from the maps of it that live inside our minds, we get all nervous and excited about that, up to the point of doubting the existence of reality itself. You want to test reality? There are two ways: electricity and gravity. Electricity, at the voltage necessary to feel it, can be painful and even dangerous. Gravity, you feel it every day and pay no attention to it. Next time you go for a walk, shut off that inner chatterbox of yours and focus your attention on the mass of energy called the human body and feel the downward pull of Earth\u2019s gravity. Do this for some years, and eventually you will also notice the electrical energy in your muscles that resist that downward pull. OK, maybe you can swing this in a couple of weeks, but you\u2019d have to be really persistent and stubborn to shut down the inner talk long enough to form conscious memories of gravity and your body. You might need to practice learning how to turn off the inner talking machinery first, that is what meditation used to be for, centuries ago, maybe it still is but most of what I hear and read about is silly stuff, you know, how to live better, some solipsistic self improvement agenda, nothing to do with what I am talking about. Anyway, the electricity in our bodies can be experienced directly by an attention that knows how to focus on that sensation. It will tell you very sharp and clearly what is real and what is not. ",

            "answer_text": "A legend tells how once N\u00e2rada said to Krishna, \"Lord, show me Maya.\" A few days passed away, and Krishna asked Narada to make a trip with him towards a desert, and after walking for several miles, Krishna said, \"Narada, I am thirsty; can you fetch some water for me?\" \"I will go at once, sir, and get you water.\" So Narada went. At a little distance there was a village; he entered the village in search of water and knocked at a door, which was opened by a most beautiful young girl. At the sight of her he immediately forgot that his Master was waiting for water, perhaps dying for the want of it. He forgot everything and began to talk with the girl. All that day he did not return to his Master. The next day, he was again at the house, talking to the girl. That talk ripened into love; he asked the father for the daughter, and they were married and lived there and had children. Thus twelve years passed. His father-in-law died, he inherited his property. He lived, as he seemed to think, a very happy life with his wife and children, his fields and his cattle and so forth. Then came a flood. One night the river rose until it overflowed its banks and flooded the whole village. Houses fell, men and animals were swept away and drowned, and everything was floating in the rush of the stream. Narada had to escape. With one hand be held his wife, and with the other two of his children; another child was on his shoulders, and he was trying to ford this tremendous flood. After a few steps he found the current was too strong, and the child on his shoulders fell and was borne away. A cry of despair came from Narada. In trying to save that child, he lost his grasp upon one of the others, and it also was lost. At last his wife, whom he clasped with all his might, was torn away by the current, and he was thrown on the bank, weeping and wailing in bitter lamentation. Behind him there came a gentle voice, \"My child, where is the water? You went to fetch a pitcher of water, and I am waiting for you; you have been gone for quite half an hour.\" \"Half an hour! \" Narada exclaimed. Twelve whole years had passed through his mind, and all these scenes had happened in half an hour! And this is Maya. ",

The illusion takes soooooo looooong to change frames. The present illusion that we are in now has been with us for about 75 to 100 years. The illusion usually starts changing in the way people dress to express themselves. It is the right side of the brain that controls the illusion. The left side just interacts with it. At the present time, there are female singers who were trying to change the illusion into less warlike situations by their expressions of partial nudity. But, that was stopped very quickly. And it lingers. With illusions, the left side of the brain perpetuates the circumstances inside. The longest lasting illusion has been of money, of worth. It was originally right brain status. The left brain perpetuated the right brain status into the printing of coins. Then it became the more coins you had the more status. That illustrates how the left brain perpetuates the right brain ideas. We have to understand what is meant by \u2018illusion.\u2019 The things that are seen, touched, felt, or otherwise manipulated like the buildings, the houses, the cars, and all the things created out of any substance are not the illusion. Those are the absolute, the real; the left brain creations to perpetuate the right brain illusion. The illusion is the overall mental landscape controlled by the right brain. ",

So, if the systems governing our sight were to change, so too would our perception of the world around us. This isn't to say that what is around us isnt actually there, but more that we may or may not be seeing its true form. To simplify this, imagine two people looking at the same object. One sees it as blue, the other sees it as white. In the abscence of any medical reasons for the difference, each person beleives their view to be the correct and real form of what they are viewing. In truth, the difference lies in the way the brain has translated the signal from the eyes. For all they know the actual object may be bright pink!! Also interesting to note is the structure of the atom, in that there is thought to be more empty space in the structure of an atom than there is matter. So what we see as a solid object is in truth a collection of atomic nuclei, surrounded by orbiting electrons that interact with each other to form that object and give it its properties. So in thinking of the microscopic structure of the world, the macroscopic perception of the world could be thought of as a kind of visual illusion. ",

            "answer_text": "Before answering this question, I shall rephrase for clarity: \"Is our known reality an illusion as distinct from what?\" As illustrated in Joshua Engels answer, the word 'reality' is used to label clearly different concepts. When pondering this question in my early 20's, I found it useful to draw a distinction between knowledge, and what this knowledge is of (the epistemological versus the ontological question.) Unfortunately, in the English language (and most of western philosophy) no distinctly different terms are in common use to refer separately to these different concepts. I therefore invented one. I chose to call my accumulated knowledge and experience 'my reality', your accumulated knowledge and experience 'your reality' and what this knowledge is of 'Actuality'. In eastern philosophical traditions this distinction is clearly evident - the latter concept may be called 'Tao' or 'Sunyata'. For example, in Buddhist philosophy, Sunyata refers to the voidness that constitutes ultimate reality, which is not a negation of existence but rather the  undifferentiated whole out of which all apparent entities, distinctions, and  dualities arise. Sunyata refers to the absence of inherent essence in all phenomena.-------Once this distinction is made, it becomes clear that 'my reality' is an illusion and 'your reality' is a different illusion - after all, our respective realities are computer simulations constructed by our respective minds. Indeed, from my subjective perspective there is no difference between this illusion I call 'my reality' and the concepts I call 'my mind' and/or 'my consciousness'. At first, I thought of 'Actuality' in terms of a system of constraints, much as Joshua Engel (\"tightly constrained rules\".) However, later in life, I realised that the tradition from eastern philosophy is superior. All I can ever know of 'Actuality' is contained within 'my reality' and therefore, any constraint that I might imagine formed part of 'Actuality' becomes, in fact, a part of 'my reality'. In other words, the concept of these constraints is redundant - the concept of 'Actuality', however is not as it permits clarity in thought and discourse.-------Now we might address the question is general terms. What therefore, is the meaning of 'our known reality'? As can be seen, 'our reality' must be a consensus of some sort, a name given to a collective of knowledge and experience. And, yes, it (if it is possible to refer to such a 'thing' in the singular) must also retain characteristics of an illusion. In other words all realities are virtual, and can be modeled in terms of a simulation.-------And, you may now ask, what of 'Actuality', what do we know of that? We know of 'Actuality', only that contained within our respective realities, and these realities are constructs based upon our respective accumulated knowledge and experience (our respective histories.) We share realities to the extent that we share common histories; both in an evolutionary (genetic) sense, and in a cultural sense. ",

Fundamentally, we all live in meat suits, with a myriad of sensors, nerves sending our brains signals and information about the world they are biologically designed to capture at every moment. The information we receive via this process only allows us to build a mental model of what we believe the world to be around us. The more information we receive the better our model will be of course. A blind person will have a very different model of their world. In addition, everything that exists is formed by bundles of energy. What you perceive to be a solid object consists of 90% empty space. Molecules and atoms are pushed apart by repulsive force giving us the illusion of a tactile and solid surface, when in fact there isn\u2019t one. So there is a dance that objective reality and our senses swing to.

            "answer_text": "WE HAVE FOUND IT! THE ULTIMATE REALITY!!!!!!!!!! Pyramids seem to be really made by aliens and really big and unimaginable mind. They say many actual things and numbers about space, universe and science. They contain many mathematical numbers. But all this is known in world, though I would also mention my view. I have heard that to the person sitting in the center of pyramid there comes some energy of space and nature from top point of pyramid, especially in meditation and even it is also mentioned in X-Men Apocalypse that in Egypt the light form top point of pyramid could give some special powers to a person while chanting some mantras and which made that Godly Demon the villain in film. I also believe that aliens also told us that it could be that humanoid mind of the universe of which whole universe is image(as told in holographic theory) is also sitting in pyramid and drawing energy from top Proof of holographic theory in observations: When we think white people should be powerful and strong so they are, when we think we should get someone like Sachin Tendulkar personality in cricket so it is, when we think there should be extreme science but still spirituality and traditional stuff so it is. When we think that things should not be so straight like the story of Sandeep Singh in Soorma, so it is, when we think that we should see unnatural Russian style of memory in chess of Gary Kasparov, then learned style of Vishwanathan Anand, then talent style of Magnus Carlsen, so it is. We would have never digested European crap sized countries to be at the forefront of the power in modern world, so it happened the power structure shifted to USA after 2nd World War. And when we could never think that our thinking or this universe can ever end then so it is, never ends our thinking and its expansion universe. THESE ARE THE UNIVERSE AND SCIENCE RELATED MANY BIG MATH NUMBERS ABOUT PYRAMIDS: Mathematical Encoding in the Great Pyramid The Great Pyramid of Giza, the oldest and sole surviving Wonder of the Ancient World, has attracted the interest of philosophers, savants, and travelers for at least four millennia. Some of this interest has centered on the question of whether the ancient Egyptian culture possessed and encoded certain mathematical concepts in the pyramid\u2019s proportions and measurements. I have analyzed the Great Pyramid\u2019s geometry without considering the issues of what mathematical knowledge ancient Egyptian architect-engineers did or did not authoritatively possess. If ancient designers did encode something in the Great Pyramid, I believe they would have wanted the structure\u2019s very geometry to carry the message. Perhaps the Great Pyramid is not a tomb but a tome\u2014open to all those who possess geometrical understanding, much in the same spirit of what Plato\u2019s Academy inscribed millennia later on its door, \u201cLet no one ignorant of geometry enter.\u201d The Great Pyramid\u2019s elevation encodes three of the most important constants in mathematics: \u03c0, \u03a6, and e. The slope angle of 51\u00b051\u2019 (51.85\u00b0 in decimal form) comes from measurements taken off the remaining casing stones, according to detailed survey data from.  You can verify these encodings with the following equations. The accuracy percentage for each equation is given in parenthesis. 4 x 51.85\u00b0 / 76.30\u00b0 = e (99.998%) tan 51.85\u00b0 = 4 / \u03c0 (99.99%) cos 51.85\u00b0 = 1 / \u03a6 (99.95%) sin 51.85\u00b0 = 4 / \u03c0\u03a6 (99.94%) The constant e, known as Euler\u2019s number, wasn\u2019t discovered until 1618. Consider the possibility that this was merely rediscovery. We are generally so accepting of the myth of linear progress that it is easy to forget that sometimes knowledge is lost and not rediscovered for a very long time, if ever. For example, it has been said that the plumbing system in the palace of Knossos, Crete built in 1900 BCE wasn\u2019t matched until circa 1900 CE in England. Another way of looking at the Great Pyramid is by analyzing its relative proportions. If the base measures unit length then a square with an equal unit edge can be drawn as shown below. A circle drawn from the center with radius equal to the height of the pyramid has a circumference equal to the square\u2019s perimeter. Thus, the Great Pyramid \u201csquares the circle.\u201d Its form approximates the solution sought by ancient geometers, who for many generations endeavored to square the circle by length (squaring a circle by area is a related problem). Note: exact squaring of the circle is impossible due to the transcendental qualities of \u03c0 (proved by Lindemann in 1882).  In addition to relative proportions, I wondered if the Great Pyramid might encode anything in absolute units? To find out, I drew its elevation in a computer aided design program in actual size, according to J.H. Cole\u2019s surveyed values (I used 755.775 feet for the mean base edge length). I rediscovered many layers of encoding in the Great Pyramid by taking its precise measure and looking for patterns. If you inscribe an equilateral triangle inside, this is what immediately pops out: the green triangle\u2019s edge length is 555.5 feet, or 6666 inches. This distance happens to match the height of the Washington Monument and the length of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral but that is another story (to learn more see my video series, Secrets In Plain Sight). The key pattern to observe is the repeating digits, even though it goes against what we think we know about the English foot\u2019s provenance.  Another method of analyzing the pyramid geometry is with a square rotated 45\u00b0 with respect to the ground plane. The largest such square that fits inside the pyramid\u2019s elevation encodes two circles across its diagonal, having circumferences equaling exactly 666.6 feet each, allowing that the slope angle of 51\u00b051\u2019 has an accuracy of only 99.8%.  If you circumscribe the pyramid\u2019s elevation triangle and then measure the circle\u2019s diameter, this equals 777.7 feet (99.97% accurate with a slope of 51\u00b051\u2019 and base length of 755.775 feet). In addition, the inscribed circles shown below in red and blue have circumferences of 777 feet and 7777 inches, respectively. Sevens abound!  This next image depicts a single inscribed circle having a diameter of 365.242 feet inside the pyramid\u2019s elevation that echoes Earth\u2019s tropical year of 365.242 days. The circle\u2019s exact diameter is 2.2 feet longer than this measurement, but this small delta might reference the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which is like an onionskin at this scale, roughly equaling the thickness of the diagram\u2019s lines.  RBP The most amazing realization is the Great Pyramid encodes all of this and more simultaneously. This single triangle is clearly above my pay grade to design! We don\u2019t really know when the inch, foot, yard, furlong, mile system was invented, although it appears to date back at least to Elizabethan England. Maybe that was when this system of measurement was rediscovered as a complete system, or maybe the knowledge resurfaced only after being long preserved by a secret society (John Dee and/or Francis Bacon come to mind). More research is needed to definitively answer these intriguing questions. Around the time of my birth, writer and deep-thinker John Michell rediscovered that the Great Pyramid\u2019s elevation geometry encodes the true proportions of the Moon and Earth. This is evident when you bring these two bodies together such that the Moon is tangent to Earth\u2019s surface. The tip of the shaded pyramid diagrammed below is at the center of the Moon and the base of the pyramid runs along Earth\u2019s equator. I have illustrated this relationship and added relevant dimensions. It turns out that the combined mean diameters of Moon and Earth measure 10080 miles (99.96% accurate according to NASA).  RBP The five Platonic solids include the icosahedron and dodecahedron, which are specifically classified as mathematical duals. In this context, dual means the vertices of one solid correspond to the faces of the other. Therefore, the icosahedron and dodecahedron are like opposite sides of the same coin. Consider the following correlation, showing that the sum of all the angular degrees in these two solids equals 10080, the same number of miles in the Moon-Earth system\u2019s mean diameter.  Was the mile specifically designed to encode this \u201cPlatonic\u201d relationship with the Moon-Earth system or is our system\u2014and by extension the entire universe\u2014a mathematical construct in a simulation?

            "answer_text": "Probably not.  It would make the whole world more difficult to explain.  The theories we have about space and time and the cosmos in  general seem to be very sparse and accurate. Darwinism and psychology are major aspects for understanding life and unconsciousness.  It would be all very difficult to explain how the entire history (and the amount of facts current theories can account for) in a \"everything is illusion\" way.  I, for one, can't imagine that I could have made up all wonders of nature and life by myself, not even in an illusion. It's just too hard.  Plus, if everything is an illusion, then I would be one myself, and that would be even harder to explain (you get regression: an illusion in an illusion in an illusion).  So: no. But that does not mean that your memory is inaccurate or is partially illusory. One should not be too sure about one's memories. But most often, those memories are quite ok, and worth treasuring.

            "answer_text": "Illusion: a thing that is or is likely to be wrongly perceived or interpreted by the senses; a deceptive appearance or impression; a false idea or belief. It is not true that everything in our life just an illusion. But when we fail to understand experience and are deceived, then things become illusions. Sensory illusion is an unavoidable artifact of our senses but our minds have evolved the ability to accurately interpret what our senses present to us. Though we have the ability to accurately interpret our senses, we too often fail to do so. We typically interpret our experience to be what we expect reality to be rather than what it empirically is because it is too inefficient to analyze everything. Good assumptions can quickly lead to good results that keep us alive, but bad assumptions give rise to illusion. It is critical to get this right; the world is not an illusion. It is our misunderstanding of the world that gives rise to illusions. What\u2019s wrong with many of the other answers given here is they are unfounded on any facts and only based on preconceptions and cherished beliefs. Those answers cannot be acted on nor tested to verify them. They may be aesthetically pleasing to some, but they are not useful in any real world application. Those answers are themselves illusions. The answer I have given is based on facts and is verifiable. Furthermore, it is actionable because you can put it into direct application. To distinguish illusion from reality, test empirically. ",

            "answer_text": "Our eyes perceive only a fraction of reality, that\u2019s why the things we perceive are bound to be an illusion. Our eyes can see large molecules and all that we see are between large molecules and stars. But if we look under a microscope there are smaller molecules and atoms, protons, nuclei etc and they are all moving. If we look at a table we see a solid object without any movement, but if we could have the eyes of a microscope that could see the field of atoms - not just the small spot under the microscope - we would see a world of moving particles, small particles moving through the pores of larger particles, and even smaller particles moving through larger particles. Each of these smaller particles form a dimension, that we cannot see, and it is a different dimension from the one we can see. We can only see the dimension of large molecules, but we live in many different dimensions. When we pass away as we say, we only shed our outer layer of large particles and keep on living in all other dimensions. This is part of a very interesting study of the Dafa teachings or teachings of the Great Law of the Universe which forms part of the cultivation practice of Falun Gong. The teachings are progressive and should be read in its entirety from a to z to avoid misunderstanding. The introductory book is Falun Gong and the main book ZHUAN FALUN-INDEX ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, this question reminds me of an editorial I read in the magazine The Vedantha Kesari, published by Sri Ramkrishna Math of Chennai, some time about 1992. In the views of a philosopher, quoting the Shri Shankara Bhagavathpada, Brahmam sathyam, jaganmidhya, jeevo brahmaiva naa parah: which may be translated into \u201c The Brahmam ( =The GOD ) is true, the world is an illusion ( this world exists for those who recognize the existence and does not exist, for those who ignore it\u2019s existence. ),and the individual jeeva is nothing but the Brahmam. In that editorial, the writer brings up the subject of a person who is dreaming some thing. As long as the dreamer is going through the experience of dream, THE DREAM IS A REALITY FOR HIM. All his experiences will be one hundred percent real. If he is hungry, eating relieves him of hunger. If he thirsty, he will drink water and there by quenches his thirst. He will come to know about the fact that the dream is JUST A DREAM , only when he comes out of his sleep. So, the author ends the editorial with a question: \u201cThe people in the world think and take it for granted that the world is real. What is the guarantee that they are not just dreaming about the so called real world \u2018in their dreams?!\u2019. So, my opinion is that the reality of the world vanishes the moment we come out of our dream making us believe that \u2018we are living in a real word\u2019! ",

Leaving aside the whole argument about 'matter' and 'Consciousness' for the moment. It it clear that the shape of the 'cube' is known.  It is called 'the' cube... as there is only one definition: an object with six sides at right angles to each other that are all the same shape and size. This form is an 'objective fact' that is only Known. It is impossible to see such a form. Notice that any apparent cube is formed of a coloured pattern (in the Seeing) where only 1-3 sides are apparent at any time. And these 'sides' appear to change shape and size depending on the viewing angle.  As such, the apparent cube cannot be the Known cube.  It is really a 2D projection of the Known 3D cube.  As such it is an illusion. Similarly, it is Known that the 'thumb' is much smaller than a 'mountain'... but held up to the 'eye', it appears bigger.  Again, it is plain that the apparent thumb is an illusion. Notice also how things that are Known to be fixed in place appear to move relative to each other as the viewpoint apparently changes.  Again, the apparent movement must be an illusion. All the apparent world is clearly an illusion. What's not an illusion?  ",

If you consider that what we experience as solid matter is described by science these days as comprising up to90% \u201cempty space\u201d does that seem to be illusory? It's kind of matrix red pill blue pill material. If you became aware that your entire history was experienced in a test tube, would that mean it wasn't real? Not for you I would suggest. If you taste strawberry and it turns out to be synthesised chemicals, you still tasted strawberry right? We share a desire to be convinced of things. Reality is nescessarily individual. Subjective. This should be a good thing. It is humbling. Yet humans constantly attempt to dictate others reality. Consensus is helpful, dictatorship is abuse. Pure arrogance. So illusion or not, if we can't truly know, if it is out of our capacity then does it matter? The desire for \u201creality\u201d is like the desire for \u201ctruth\u201d . Sure we seem to have that desire but has anyone acheived either? Honestly ? No. We try and try but it is elusive and we must admit the subjective reality of the individual and to try and speak for them is not going to fly. It is dictatorship again. But hey, if you were informed that your whole life experience was an illusion , wasn't it a good one? Fuck it! ",

It is a virtual experiment created in linear time to study emotions. Our hologram is composed of grids created by a source consciousness brought into awareness by electromagnetic energy at the physical level. The hologram is created and linked through a web, or grid matrixes based on the patterns of Sacred Geometry. The hologram had a beginning and it has an end, as consciousness evolves in the alchemy of time. In short, Physicist suggests that our world is just the 3 dimensional virtual reality projection written in 2 dimension. Let us understand this theory in the following way, according to recent research in the field of quantum physics, all of what we know as matter - the solid cement of what appears to be what our reality is composed of - could be nothing more than quantum fluctuations in the middle of the empty universe. Caveat: This still lacks in consensus among the physicists and hence cannot be considered mainstream. ",

            "answer_text": "Dear Quora friend, \u201cIs life an illusion?\u201d A very intriguing question! I have no idea! What is worse, I have no idea who might be the right person to reliably answer it. Undoubtedly, it is not me! That\u2019s for sure! Nevertheless, as I am intrigued, I will philosophise -once more on this forum- and try to give a \u2018sensible\u2019 reply depending on my emotions rather than on logic. Whether being an illusion or not, life seems to have no meaning per se. It is ouselves who are responsible for applying meaning to it. This meaning is relevant both to our nature and to our nurture. Meaning can be derived from our experiences, needs, expectations, as well as from our \u2018illusionary\u2019 yet trustworthy brain schemata of ideas and visions. Finding no sense in living will probably lead us to either nihilism or metaphysics. Nothing is wrong with either nihilism or metaphysics, provided we can bear extreme pessimism or frivolous optimism so that we can go on living in balance with our values and in accordance with our ethos. In short, no matter whether life is an illusion or not, we have to treasure and embrace it as self-created and self-creating. All life is a \u2018self-invited guest\u2019, who we had better treat well all the way from womb to tomb. Life deserves our \u2018hospitality\u2019 and so does any living creature on the Earth. I am not being religious at all, I am just a conscious human being who enjoys being alive, either as an illusioned or as a disillusioned person! With love Calomoira Estianidi ",

Physics informs us that time is an illusion, that present don't exist, that life is wholly deterministic. The last bit is dreadful to comprehend as we are taught that free will exist. Else what is the point of life if we don't have free will? According to Dr. V.S. Ramachandran's \"wiggling your finger\" experiment free will does not exist. This isn't new. Free will has been in exiled for a long time.  This is not the end but the beginning of new frontier. This latest chapter in Homo sapiens is an interesting one. We need new physics to address our universe. That is the new challenge. PS: for more evidence, google Benjamin Libet. He had done some experiment in free will. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet ",

And if you are not you probably have to regenerate/reincarnate like a computer game. Using ancient artifacts, structures and tablet texts as clues. When Shakespeare said \u2018all the worlds a stage\u2019 I took that very literally in my own mind. Everyone has their role to play. I studied sociology a while in my college years too and the whole sociological theory was built around seeing the bigger picture in society and apply it to life globally. And how schools and churches etc are institutions that indoctrine us into being good slaves really. We really are nothing but slaves all of us. If you think for a second they say we have freewill in life, but it's nonsense. We have an alloted amount of free will within a multiple choice option. I'd like to share this video with you as I love your question so much. I found it sometime ago and think it would blow your mind. Trouble is I'm not so great at tech. I'm quite old fashioned, eccentric and odd. Im unsure how to link the video. If you could instruct me how to add a link I think I won't give you food for thought but a weekly shop. Hope to hear back. I'm looking for it as soon as it submit this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A: Much of life is definitely an illusion, but not everything. Our perception of things is influenced by having defined words for them. Every noun cleaves the universe of our experience into two parts: part to which the noun applies and part to which it doesn't. The distinction is not always natural. In many cases the distinction doesn't really exist, except in our perception. The objects and people we deal with daily are irrelevant at the scale of cells, and even less so at the scale of molecules. Nor do we have any significance on the scale of galaxies. Nor are things on those scales noteworthy to us as we attend to our lives (unless we are scientists). The universe that we observe is different from what actually exists in itself, but I do think it is not all imagined. The difference is due to our perception that time flows. It is decidedly psychological, not a feature of physics. But to banish this illusion would be to stop thought! Sentience has no existence or meaning unless time flows. The experience of flow so influences our language that we can hardly speak of anything without alluding to time flowing. ",

Yet walls seem to be unaware of the fact that they are illusions if you are unaware of their existence. If you talk about everything in your brain being an illusion you are using the wrong word. Your brain does not create illusions, it creates expectations, probabilities of what is out there. This as a result of the time laps between seeing, feeling, experiencing the world around you and the processing of the information in your brain and making you aware of what is important in your surroundings. Without this predicting you would walk into walls, bump into other people, poor tea into your lap. And life would probably be just a big forrest on this plannet. ",

As we have become more technologically advanced, we have developed many technological aids to help us perceive reality in finer and finer detail. We can image galaxies billions of light years away, and also the crystalline matrix of individual atoms. We can detect all manner of energies and frequencies that are hidden to our natural senses. We can detect things like neutrinos that are so weakly interactive with matter that billions of them pass through our bodies constantly without us being aware. Finally\u2026.

            "answer_text": "Actually, there are two parts to what you are asking, I suppose. Strap on\u2026 First, life in itself is not an illusion. In fact, people (almost everyone I have come across), over-generalize their OWN living style, circumstances and situations as LIFE but what they are truly wanting to say is MY LIFE. So, this living of yours along with all the ups and downs and everything within it is pretty much real because you can experience it. It is not an illusion - for you. You are living it and feeling it. But, if you have really meditated for a good amount of time on the path of self inquiry OR if you are a spiritual person OR you have had some divine experiences then your outlook towards life is not relevant / restricted to your own living but now you can SEE the LIFE - in it\u2019s entirety - for everyone around you. This is the time when you really see for yourself that \u201cOh my! What an Illusion I have been living under\u201d. This is the time when you realize, that the other people are STILL living the way YOU lived before this moment of realization. And then you wonder, \u201cWhy is life an Illusion?\u201d Are you at the stage of realization I mention above while you pose that question? If not, then the rest of the stuff might be just mumbo-jumbo, for you. If life was not an illusion then the pain and suffering in this world would be highly apparent and most people wouldn\u2019t be so enthusiastic or struggling to live. In that case, the grand design of creation would fail. So, to keep up with the design of the creation everyone has to live and that is made possible by illusion. I can explain this in so many ways but to keep it simple - while most people think that they are here, living and in pursuit of their desires and what not actually would be very much disappointed to know that they are here BECAUSE of other people - think Karma! To save people from disappointment the curtain of illusion is pretty much needed. The illusion is by default and by design. Lastly, our end goal is STILL to come out of this illusion and see the light. ",

So do we see an illusion or what we want to see? Take what you understand and mold it to fit what you want to remember. Understand it, visualize it and unfold it. This perception can understand the illusion and as we understand this illusion we only perceive what holds the limits to our betterment. It is part of our learning purpose. To understand the perception we must become the illusion by allowing the entity of SELF to encounter every moment in the face of what really is not there. ",

But if life is reality, then the fact that life is illusion is again a reality, thus life is illusion, but again if life is illusion then the fact that life is illusion is again an illusion, this means life is real\u2026.and so on. The above statements seem to contradict themselves, it creates a paradox. So thinking that life is illusion, is very confusing. We must know that illusion is always caused by something and to something. This means, even if this life is illusion, then this illusion must be caused by something and to someone that 'really exists'. So there must be something that is real, even if this is an illusion. This question that 'is life real or illusion\u2019 is some of those questions, that I think humans will never be able to answer. But whatever the life is, I think that anyone can do anything in his life if he decides, it's in our hand how our life is going to be. And if we can make our life, as we want it to be, then even if this is illusion, it is a beautiful illusion and I want it to go forever. ",

And other people are real too, as are tigers and elephants and various kinds of viral \u201clife.\u201d Etc. There are illusions out there, frequently described as \u201cbeliefs,\u201d but that hardly means that everything is an illusion. ",

Birth is a truth because humans leave back the signs of their having lived on earth. This could be, the children born to them, gifted and talented folks leave behind a legacy of their talent etc. When born into a family, we believe that the members of that family are always there with us. As we grow up we believe that the friends we associate ourselves with will be with us forever. We acquire material things to make our lives very comfortable, but sadly, even the house that we build with so much of expectations may have to be abandoned because we cannot maintain it in our old age. Nothing belongs to us. We come alone to this world and leave the world alone. ",

That is how illusions happen, they take advantage of our brain\u2019s tendency to work with expectations and to skip a lot of processing, replacing it instead with what is expected. And indeed, reality is created in the brain, corroborating the data received from senses and integrating it in the main narrative. I guess, from a poetic point of view, you could extrapolate and say that everything is an illusion because everything is temporary. But from a more strict perspective, illusion refers to those errors in interpreting data, those glitches of perception. ",

This continuity is Broken twice ( At Birth or Death) since I Don't know what happened before Birth or what will happen after Death . Life is a interpolation (between Birth and Death) that is only Knowable . This makes us Question the nature of reality . There can be four situation 1 You are illusion and world is real 2 You are Real and world is illusion 3 Both are illusion (You and World ) 4 Both are real ( You and World ) You are Definitely not a illusion (I Think therefore I am - Rene Descartes) . Now we are left with two choice whether world is real or illusion . I have two guess First world can be a Merged reality ( (Merger of infinite Individual realities) second it could be Illusion (Like a Dream because it's superficial creation of one individual None we see in Dream is related to Reality except us) So my conviction is I am surely real ( ie I existed before Birth and will survive our Death ) But world may or may not be real ( Could be Real or Elaborate Dream ) ",

Essentially, it is arrogant to assume that we are living in base reality. Rather, if you look at the trajectory of technology over the past 40 years, we can chart the progress of video games from pong to AR/VR. If society were to somehow continue on for 100,000 years, is could be feasible that humans could create a simulation with such high authenticity that it would mirror real life. Therefore, since it is highly unlikely that we are living in true reality, then that means we are living in another civilization\u2019s simulation. Can they see, hear, or watch us? Who knows? Either we will create another simulation as the civilization before us did or we will perish. Just some food for thought\u2026 ",

When you see something located very far away, the mental representation of that object also feels as though it's far away, but that image is really only happening right inside your brains. That feel of distance can be thought of as an illusion. When you think about it, all your experiences can suddenly become rather claustrophobic, knowing that all that experienced spaciousness is really an illusion, and a mere representation of the real thing. Somewhat like the Matrix. ",

If you just remember tragedies, your perception of life will be a tragedy. It is illusion even scientifically. Things we see are merely the light particals. Touch is technically a reppultion between electrons on our skin and the solid things. It only depends on our understanding and perception of life. If you feel it's an illusion you will get all proofs of life being an illusion. If you feel life is based on facts and reality you will get all proofs that life holds in its facts. However increasing the size of our understanding will only give us an unbiased view of our deceiving reality. ",

In various stages of life we find things that are not permanent but just a passing phase. I think this sums up the whole thing. Only death is permanent and the absolute truth. Even nowadays many renowned meta physicians and scientists are coming up with the fact that Time and Space are just a creation of our own minds to make things simpler, it can also  be proved with the double slit experiment where the behaviour of the bullet or an arrow completely depends upon our observation. Even if life is an illusion we must decode this to find out what's there in store for us as we gradually become a different being through various stages of life. :) ",

We are in school here. We created this illusion, with constraints and boundaries associated with it, to learn. To learn lessons. We are actually spiritual and untethered by nature. Overtime as we realize this, we will become less tethered to this material world and wake up to the fact that we are spiritual beings. ",

Only once you realized that this alternate reality was, in fact, the real reality could you know that the reality we believe in now is just an illusion. Until you find this alternate reality, no, our known reality isn't an illusion. ",

Ultimately all of what we call reality is something that our brain creates based on some very simple electrical impulses it receives from its sensory neurons.  It's amazing how creative we have managed to be.  I often wonder if other people perceive things the same as me.  I mean in all likelyhood, yes, but perhaps if it really made no difference for survival then maybe each of our brains just sort of make it up as they go along.  I mean we know there are locations for sight and sound and touch, but who's to say my touch center is perceived the same as someone else's? Maybe mine feels like colors and light? Bad example, but it's all a subjective experience I guess, so we may never find out.  And ultimately it wouldn't matter we'd still end up utilizing them the same way so they'd be indistinguishable in the end.  Anyway.. Back to the point, in this regard reality is very much made up by yourself.  In fact, for all you know everyone else is made up too.  Or we are all the same mind, and it doesn't really belong to you as much as you think it does. ",

In the rest of Hindu philosophy, Maya is an illusion, but not in the sense of a hallucination. It is the veil that prevents us from seeing reality as it is. In modern terms, it\u2019s our cultural conditioning that puts blinkers on our eyes. Any Hindu would say that the universe was created by the Divine. If it is, it\u2019s real, not a mistake or a joke. Reality is the only thing there is. There is nothing that isn\u2019t real, not even nothingness, because nothingness is a concept, and concepts are real. The wildest hallucinations of an epileptic are real events in the brain of the sufferer. Fantasies are real, dreams are real, every thing is real. Reality is the totality, and in that sense, Reality is God. ",

When we don't have a clarity and ability to face the unexpected, we live in chaos and sinks into disappointment. And coming out of such illusion is very tough once we enter.    To certain extent , our life is an illusion of our own mind. This was already emphasized by His Highness Adi Sankaracharya as \"The whole world is a Illusion\". We never know what is the reality and truth. We act based on our interpretations on every aspect of life and we don't look at it should be. Half knowledge kills and illusion of mind played by such a half knowledge mind is very dangerous. ",

There may be more simulations, such as humans veering towards environmental innovations and building the planet to be sustainable, a system where money is not needed or not even considered, people just work for the common goal to live sustainable. Another system could see females as the power and the dictators to see what type of world this results in. Maybe the current human simulation we live now has various input factors which leads us to stop having children in a few thousand years or we may develop robots which can replicate and behave as humans, so they can take over. We just have no idea. But what we can all agree on is the massive pace of technological developments in last 50 years indicates the capability of humans to change course fast. ",

At a practical level, we define things as illusions when they appear to be true from one perspective but do not hold up to broad-perspective scrutiny. If our existence seems to hold up to all manner of scrutiny then perhaps that reveals that it cannot be an illusion. Both the Big Bang theory and Quantum Mechanics have held up against predictions that could not be confirmed for many decades. So, it would not be wise to run out of food or fail to pay your taxes.

The unconscious mind is only a memory box that the conscious mind uses to be mobile or to remember every day necessities. The illusion is that these minds do not get on together? To get to the subconscious, we have to try and get around the conscious. Under hypnosis we can be led to believe we are who we are not, or did what we didn't, then you can see that the unconscious mind is just a sponge and asks no questions. We are just a memory being, every second is our past memory, there is no present moment but for a very split second. The second gone by is now our memory?????????????????

We can see it, touch it, smell it and possibly hear it as the wind rustles the leaves, that much is true, but we are missing the most important part, the essence of the tree, the roots. So, I suggest that this is true throughout our existence, we pass through life unaware of what I will refer to as spiritual values.

All the quantum effects give birth to the classical phenomenon to lie in the ambit of awareness of an observer (i.e. sentient beings). Rather it is a relativistic reality that we perceive all the while. We perceive apparent reality as a quantum collapse of a wave function of a particular experience. Thus till the efforts are made, such experience remains in its virtual appearances that possesses infinite potential probabilities to manifest through the so called material experiences. Thus the term reality is incomprehensible. The ultimate reality is that we are the source of consciousness that not only enlightens both these realities but all types of illusions and delusions also. We all are beyond all the concepts of realities, existence/non-existence and illusions/delusions. ",

(Using your money to help others can only bring you happiness.)Thinking that you can't love everyone (but actually you can love everyone).Believing that keeping fit will give you long life.

Death.. we fear so much of death, but in real world, this is illusion, because the soul gets transferred from one body to another, and we make up that it's permanent. But the truth is that, if there is no illusions,there is no reality. Reality is nothing but what is real, what is actual, the facts,etc. But aren't these facts created by us, so basically it's an illusion. Therefore, the path from illusion to reality is quite much tricky to understand the whole loop of this life. :) ",
