            "answer_text": "Before answering, we need to go back a bit and apply some common sense. Unlike nuclear weapons, nerve agents don\u2019t leave behind a traceable signature, so it was never going to be possible for Porton Down to prove where the agent was made. All they, or anyone else, could do was to confirm what family of agents it came from and possibly say if it had been used before/where. Anything else was either media hype, ignorance or deliberate misinformation. Russia is known to have manufactured this type of agent before. Making it is not easy and requires technical expertise that not every nation has. Russia has form when it comes to exotic assassinations and disregards for the norms of civilised behaviour when conducting said assassinations. Unless the perpetrators are caught and confess to Russia being behind this attack (unlikely on both counts), there will never be proof. Even if they are caught, does anyone expect Russia to admit to it? Seriously? Russian pronouncements would have people believe that the U.K. did this to themselves, poisoning not only the two Russians but an innocent policeman. Again, seriously? Other Russian shills have suggested it might have been third party states out to tarnish Russia, impact on the recent reelection of Putin, or impact on relations between the U.K. and Russia. Relationships between the West and Russia have been frosty since their annexation of Crimea and the indiscriminate sowing of polonium around London. They have also hinted the attack may have been the work of a terrorist group. Come on, if terrorists had access to nerve agents, why use it on an ex-spy and his daughter and not in the London Underground? Doesn\u2019t make sense. So, all we are left with is motivation and previous form. Contrary to what the shills would have one believe, this scandal played very well for Putin in Russia and helped bolster his re-election shtick, reinforcing both his hardman/don\u2019t messy with me persona and the \u201ceveryone is out to get Russia\u201d narrative so beloved of Dictators throughout history. It also sends a clear message to would be traitors. We will get you and kill you in nasty ways. The attack also was a test of NATO and EU solidarity in a soon to be post Brexit world. So, we come to the original question; how will the UK and Russia behave. Pretty much as they are now. Russian denials, sarcasm, misinformation and knowing winks eg \u201cYou know we did it and we know you know, but we hold you in contempt so don\u2019t give a toss. We dare you to do anything else.\u201d On the British side, we will continue to do what we are good at, namely working behind the scenes with worthwhile allies, learning how the nerve agents behave and coming up with counter-measures. There will probably be some more tit for tat expulsions and restrictions on Russians abroad entering the UK, but that\u2019s about it. I can\u2019t see Putin authorising another attack for some time. As I have written in other posts, it\u2019s all part of the great game. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to read the wording. The chief scientist says that they have identified the chemical, but not it\u2019s source. This is a logical statement that arises from the lack of widespread manufacture or posession of the substance: There\u2019s not a sample rack that identifies all Novichok stocks, sources etcetera. This marks the stuff as different from Polonium, for the benefit of public opinion. Polonium leaves a radioactive trail, wherever it goes: I think they even found it on the plane used to come to the UK. Novichok is different. What the scinetist also did was to issue a categorical denial that the substance came from his own laboratory. It is a measure of the Russian desperation to control this story, that they first accuse Porton Down of a role in the affair, then denigrate the denials - and the instand PD say something objective and scientific, they claim it as proof of a completely different explanation. I guess all that Vodka doesn\u2019t exactly help the old attention span. ",
