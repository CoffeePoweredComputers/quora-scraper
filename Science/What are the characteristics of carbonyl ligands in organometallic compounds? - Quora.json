            "answer_text": "Carbonyls are one of most versatile ligands in the organometallic chemistry. CO ligand act as both Lewis \u03c3 base and Lewis \u03c0 acid. The bonding between the metal and carbonyl has two components: The \u03c3 bonding between the metal and carbon.The \u03c0-backbonding between the metal d-orbital and \u03c0* orbital of carbonyl ligand.The lone pair of electrons on the carbon are denoted as the Lewis \u03c3 base whereas the empty \u03c0* orbital (LUMO) on the carbonyl ligand is denoted as the Lewis \u03c0 acid. The d-orbital of the metal has electrons which can be donated to the \u03c0* orbital of the metal. Hence, when these orbitals overlap, the metal would push its electrons towards the ligand. This is the reason why carbonyls are termed as lewis \u03c0 acids. This type of bonding is called \u03c0-backbonding and it strengthens bonding between the metal and ligand. The reason behind this is that \u03c0-backbonding would increase the electron density on the carbon atom which would facilitate the donation of electrons to the metal via a \u03c3 bond.  Image[1] Hence, the formation of the \u03c0-bond due to \u03c0-backbonding would make the \u03c3 bond stronger. This kind of effect is termed as synergistic bonding. The charge on the metal highly influence the \u03c0-backbonding. IR spectroscopic experiments reveal that if the charge of the metal increases, then the \u03c0-back-donation increases which would strengthen the \u03c3 bond. For example: Free ligand [math] CO \u2192 2150  cm^{-1}[/math] Cation [math][Mn(CO)_6]^+ \u2192 2090  cm^{-1}[/math] Neutral [math][Cr(CO)_6] \u2192 2000  cm^{-1}[/math] Anionic [math][V(CO)_6]^- \u2192 1850  cm^{-1}[/math] From the above data it is very evident that with an increase in the charge (negative charge) on the metal, the IR frequency reduces. The reduction in the IR frequency of the metal-carbonyl bond suggests that the bonding is [math]M=C=O[/math] (more prominent structure in resonance) instead of [math]M-C \\equiv O.[/math] [math]M=C=O \u21cc M-C \\equiv O^+[/math] If the metal atom has a negative charge, then it tends to donate its electron to the \u03c0* orbital more easily than the metal atom with a positive charge. To further exemplify, consider the following set of example: [math][Ni(CO)_4] < [Co(CO)_4]^- < [Fe(CO)_4]^{-2}[/math] In the above, example, Fe is in -2 state, and thus tends to donate electrons to the carbonyl ligand via \u03c0-backbonding. Hence, the backdonation would be effective and stronger.  Reference: Atkins, P., 2010. Shriver and Atkins' inorganic chemistry. Oxford University Press, USA.Kauffman, G.B., 2014.
