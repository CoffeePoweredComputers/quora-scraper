            "answer_text": "An atom as we all know atom has shells and within these shells are present electrons, and we also know that electrons can move to higher shell to lower shell and vice versa by absorbing and radiating energy but atom cannot absorb radiation or energy of any arbitary magnitude , the energy for it to get excited is fixed, For example: it takes 13.6 ev of energy to take electron out of hydrogen atom if the energy supplied to it is 14 ev , it will not come out! Despite the fact it is more than required energy. So we say energy exactly equal to 13.6 ev is needed, moreover when the electron de-excites the electron looses energy in the form of photon , also the energy of released photon is equal to energy absorbed during excitation(that being fixed) we have fixed number of spectral lines and that too discontinous. Thank you ",

            "answer_text": "Quick answer: Atomic spectra are continuous because the energy levels of electrons in atoms are quantized. The electrons in an atom can have only certain energy levels. There is no middle ground. If an electron is excited to a new energy level, it jumps to that level instantaneously. When it returns to a lower level, it releases energy in a quantized packet. This release occurs in the form of light of a specific wavelength (colour). Hence, atomic emission spectra represent the electrons returning to lower energy levels. Each packet of energy corresponds to a line in the atomic spectrum. There is nothing between each line, so the spectrum is discontinuous.  ",
