            "answer_text": "If you close one eye, you see a flat, 2 dimensional world. With both eyes you see a 3 dimensional world. Sound, smell, taste and touch add another 4 dimensions to our view of reality. But the image exists in our mind. Every sense organ sends electrical impulses along the nervous system, to our brains. Our brains INTERPRET these electrical impulses and CREATE a image of our surroundings in our mind. This image only includes the things our senses can detect. There are light frequencies and sound waves we can't percieve. There are odours, vibrations and sound waves too faint for us to detect. Animals can detect them, so we know they exist.Yes, out minds create a more complete picture of reality than most animals, but it is not complete. Our minds take the electrical impulses coming from both eyes and creates a 3 dimensional, visual representation of our environment, in our heads. Much like a television take a signal and converts it into pictures and sounds. I'm not saying reality isn't real, although that's possible. I'm saying that our minds convert electrical impulses into the visual picture we see. And the eyes are just the antenna which capture the signal. ",
