            "answer_text": "I assumed you were referring to the Halogens and the Alkaline metals, 1 & 17 using IUPAC numbering. I would say, excluding radioactive barely there elements, Cesium & Fluorine. Fluorine is very electronegative, meaning that it REALY wants to take an electron. Cesium is not so very electronegative, it's actually one of the lowest in electronegativity's, meaning it REALY want to give an electron, its kind of like a \"match made in heaven\", chemically speaking........ PS: not may people use the old roman numeral numbering for the periods anymore, IUPAC 1-18 numbering is more readily used in schools today, that's how I learned the periods, and its stressful to say the least that we have these two different methods of numbering the periods.......RaNt oversry......
