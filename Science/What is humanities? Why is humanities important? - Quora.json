            "answer_text": "The Humanities include the the broad spectrum of subject matter included in fields relating most directly to understanding, reflecting upon, celebrating and improving the human experience. Studies in humanities are connected to but not dependent on more \u201cpractical\u201d fields in the sciences, the social sciences, technologies, vocations (business), medicine, law, computing, etc. The humanities are important because they deal with the great questions of life. Some people in recent years have come to think that it is far more important to find a way to make money than it is to learn much of anything about philosophy, religion, literature, art, music, languages, cultures, entertainment, interpersonal relations\u2026even history. The problem with being skilled only at making a paycheck is that one might have been short-changed on how to think and behave ethically. The chain reactions in a given setting, whether it be social or corporate, of unethical behavior is often devastating, far-reaching and permanently damaging to life, liberty and rational pursuits. We see it all the time. One doesn\u2019t typically get human values orientation in job-training or while precipitating chemicals in a lab. The idea that a deep understanding of WHY WE SHOULD LIVE HARMONIOUSLY is something that can be handled with a few bullet points tacked inside your cubicle at work or on inspirational posters strategically placed around the workplace is simply very, very wrong.  (Image from this excellent article in Science magazine on connecting science and the humanities) But we also need to know how to balance things in our lives, things like family and work and recreation. We need to know how to appreciate, discern and choose what comes at us in the marketplace. We need to be able to function as responsible citizens, empowered to contribute positively and constructively in our communities, improve the intangible aspects of the quality of life through creative ingenuity in the arts\u2014from concerts to movies to podcasts. Humanities provide us the keys to great experiences in these areas. The fields of study outside of the humanities are primarily utilitarian, and have their great aspects. But they tend to simply drive right on past the deeply human aspects of our existence. Get some humanities. It does a body good. ",
