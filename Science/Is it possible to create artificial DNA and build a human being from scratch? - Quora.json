            "answer_text": "From scratch? Absolutely not and it never will be. However, creating an artificial human genome is much more promising. What can not happen is to create any life from non-life. We CAN insert viable genetic data into a living being, but we can\u2019t create a living being from anything non-living, no matter what. Craig Venter created a fully synthetic genome and successfully inserted it into a cell after extracting its natural DNA. Going from there to the 3 billion base pair human DNA is a large and expensive leap, but it could just be a matter of time before that leap is realized. One hurdle is the ethical issues, while another is more a matter of whether or not it can work. Ethics aside, some organisms have shown that they will not accept some man-made genetic insertions. We will not know if a human egg will accept a synthetic genome until we try it, but it is definitely NOT out of the question. As to the ethical issues, they may be the bigger challenge, but we are already genetically modifying and cloning humans and other creatures. Where is the ethical leap to a fully synthetic genome? It is a matter of opinion whether or not it is ethically right to edit a human genome or to create any clones or GMO\u2019s for that matter. If it helps us, I don\u2019t see the problem, any more than getting a kidney transplant would be unethical. But I recognize that is only my opinion. Beyond the question the OP asked is the question of improved \u201csuper-human\u201d, with new abilities not yet seen in humans. We aren\u2019t there yet. We don\u2019t speak the genetic code. We could try to add in traits of other creatures such as venom injection, but without knowing how it would interact with our own morphology, we could end up killing ourselves with our own venom. Personally, I think the next big leap in Biology is to decipher and master the genetic code. Biology needs code-breakers more than any other skill. Despite all of the advancements of recent decades, the answer to your question is a resounding NO. To create any living thing from scratch is literally not possible because the key ingredient is conscious teleology. Without it, nothing happens. Our synthetic DNA in a test tube filled with polypeptides and nutrients galore will not transcribe, produce proteins or form any functional shapes. It will never think, animate purposively or evolve functionally. It will sit there motionlessly. The origin of life is consciousness-first, not chemicals-first. This fact becomes more and more evident the more we fail to produce life from non-life. If you want to create any form of life from scratch, we would need to master conscious teleology far better than we currently understand it. ",

            "answer_text": "It is absolutely possible and we have the technology today. But, there would be little point in such an extreme effort and a great deal of what we artificially created would be copying existing patterns we don\u2019t know what they do. All that would really be needed would be the funding and effort to do this and we could do it with what we know today. Keep in mind that being able to painstakingly create from scratch an entire Human DNA is not the same thing as knowing what all the parts of that DNA do. https://phys.org/news/2017-07-scientists-dna-life-blueprint.html https://massivesci.com/articles/its-alive-yeast-genome-create-life/ https://www.nature.com/news/how-dna-could-store-all-the-world-s-data-1.20496 We can also clone Humans today. http://www.futureworld.org/PublicZone/MindBullets/MindBulletsDetails.aspx?MindBulletID=11 https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3217-first-cloned-baby-born-on-26-december/ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/371378.stm http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/17/AR2008011700324.html?hpid=topnews https://stemcellsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1634/stemcells.2007-0252 https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(13)00215-4 https://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/fulltext/S1934-5909(14)00137-4 Now, we are also learning what the DNA does and how to program in DNA, but we are a long ways from mastering this skill. Give it another decade or two. We can also alter the existing DNA of full grown adults. ",
