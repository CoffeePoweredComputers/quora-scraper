In the series \u201cHow the Universe Works\u201d on the Science Channel \u201cNeutron Stars,\u201d they talk about a particular Magnetar that switches back and forth as a pulsar for a time and then changes to the characteristics of a Magnetar with extreme magnetic fields.

            "answer_text": "Of course, a magnetar is one of the classes of pulsars. There are three currently known classes of pulsars, each has a different source of power of EM radiation. Besides magnetar, where magnetic field decay powers pulses, pulsars can use accreated matter as source of power, and they can use rotational energy for power. ",
