            "answer_text": "Yes. Precision and accuracy are two separate qualities of a measurement, and both can be improved to a great degree. It is easier to begin with accuracy. Picture an archery target. My measurement is demonstrated by shooting arrows at the target. Accuracy means I am on target. If I am highly accurate, but not very precise, all 10 arrows hit the target, but none hit the bulls eye. If I add precision, all hit the target, and all hit the bulls eye. If I shoot 10 arrows and all hit in a tight circle the size of a bulls eye, but all are, say 10 inches to the left of the actual bulls eye on the target, then I have precision, but not accuracy. Instead of accuracy, I have a bias ten inches to the left. If one works to eliminate bias and improve accuracy, one can reach a point of being on target with an incredible degree of precision. This is necessary in the manufacture of electronic components. For example, when we produce a flat-screen TV, millions of transistors must all be made so precisely and accurately that each one works. If one fails, then a pixel of the TV will not work. For a longer explanation of bias vs. accuracy and imprecision vs. precision, read my book Business Statistics Demystified. For a detailed explanation of how great accuracy and precision can be achieved through quality management and quality engineering, read my book Quality Management Demystified. ",

            "answer_text": "To be useful a measurement must be precise AND accurate. Measuring something to the last thousandth of an inch (precision) using a device with a built-in error (accuracy) of 1/10th of an inch (tape measure for example) makes the result questionable, if not useless. A measurement or machined dimension is only as precise as the least accurate operation. \u201cDesign it with a computer, measure it with a laser, mark it with chalk and cut it with an axe.\u201d Old Engineering proverb. OK, in my college days \u201claser\u201d was \u201cmicrometer\u201d or perhaps \u201cGrade 0 gage blocks\u201d. ",
