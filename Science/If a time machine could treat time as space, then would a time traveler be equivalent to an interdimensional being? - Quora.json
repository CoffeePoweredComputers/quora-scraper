            "answer_text": "Yes of course, if we understand time as the equivalent of another dimension than a time traveler Would travel through his or her or it's dimention in much the same way as we move through our dimensions however we could also assume that to move a body of flesh is more difficult so i would assume these travellers to be more energetic to put it simply i would assume that they would be beings of energy. Then again we are also stuck with the higher dimensions like 5,6,7,and so on and we do not know what travelers from those dimensions might look like as a matter of fact we do not know how we are perceived from the lower dimensions so that's the thing we must think about first If we wish to unravel the time dilemma. i personally do not think time is a dimension i think it is a function i think it has to do with our ability to move i know i'm going out on a limb here but movement does not exist i know yeah i'm not crazy i think what we perceive to be movement is how time manifests itself in our third dimension so in our third dimension we already travel through time . You see what i'm saying. ",

            "answer_text": "In a way, yes. When a 3 dimensional being travel through time, they need to either move through a 4 dimensional coordinate (timeline or temporal coordinate) or 5th (alternate timeline), while still retaining their original dimensionality. A 3 dimensional can\u2019t become a 4th dimensional, but could have the ability of a 4th dimensional; travelling freely through time, though in our case we can\u2019t travel freely. Now, think of it like this. If a 2 dimensional drawing were to travel through 3 dimensional space, it move through the x, y, and z axis; a 3 dimensional space. Though they won\u2019t be able to see nor interact with the z axis, they\u2019d travel through it anyway and the x or y axis gives the necessary details for them to know that they\u2019re indeed moving (e.g changing line patterns, cause 2 dimensionals could only see lines; they lack width or z axis.) The same with us 3 dimensional beings. If we move through time, we can\u2019t see the t (time) axis, but we knpw that we\u2019re moving through time by seeing the movement of things in the universe. Time is a framework for any movement to happen after all. If the movement of an object goes backward or fast forwards, then we\u2019ll know we\u2019re travelling in time at a different \u2018speed\u2019 than the others. ",
