Well, it isn\u2019t any different with potatoes. If you are silly enough to abuse your digestive system in that manner you deserve the consequences. But you will be hard put to find a potato eating contest where you might win anything for your effort. Healthy eating is a matter of quality before quantity. Eat only the most nutritious food you can find and afford and only enough to get to the next meal where there are days instead of hours between them and you will be healthier and save time and money.
