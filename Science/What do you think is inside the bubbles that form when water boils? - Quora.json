            "answer_text": "Very good question I really hope this is right but I would think that the gas bubbles are actually just steam and because they are super heated they have expanded the water molecule so it pushes the still liquid water out of the way till it reaches the surface and dissipates actually this is like an experiment that proves that something exists even when there\u2019s nothing there the experiment goes like this \u2026 u take a test tube absolutely full of mercury and flip it upside down in a cup filled with mercury making sure no air gets in before you flip it into the cup and what happens next is the proof because the mercury level in the test tube will drop down an inch or 2 exposing a clear part of the test tube but with no where for any other elements to enter the sealed glass bottom so what\u2019s in that empty space ?\u2026.nothing but something but where did that nothing come from when there is no where to creep in and since 2 objects can\u2019t occupy the same space that means it wasn\u2019t there when the mercury was in that space \u2026.that is the weird world we live in and if anyone wants to hear the next part of the experiment involving a clock leave a comment here ",

            "answer_text": "Owning a clear electric kettle is great.  Initially, it's dissolved gasses which range from disinfectant from your local water purification to dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. It is interesting to watch these grow on the bottom of the kettle like inverse raindrops holding on by surface tension. Much of the dissolved gas at the top comes out of solution and forms a fog of micro-bubbles. Most of this dissolved gas rapidly goes away but a some at the bottom hangs on until there is a rolling boil which breaks the surface tension. Once the kettle gets close to a rolling boil\u2026 those bubbles are water itself in its gaseous state. Pretty impressive that one liter of water at 99\u00b0C can make over 700 litres of water vapour at 101\u00b0C.  Who ever came up with making the heating element in the bottom of this kettle semi-circular to use convection to initiate a rotary current, drawing cooler water from the top, thus and evenly mix the water as the kettle boils was rather clever.

            "answer_text": "the air near water dissolves into the water over time. Dissolved oxygen in the water in what fish need. At the point of boiling, those dissolves gases are released. So, if you had water from somewhere else, sealed in a container, and then you boiled it, the bubbles would be the air from where the water came from. There is this concept of twice boiling water, where those gases were released the first time, and then the second time, the water can become superheated and dangerous. ",

            "answer_text": "Steam. There might be a little dissolved air, but it is mostly steam. At first the bubbles form in direct contact with the pan where the heating element is, and when a bubble breaks loose it immediately encounters cooler water and condenses back to water. But that water is getting hotter both from the condensing steam and from convection from the pan bottom, and as it does the steam bubble last longer, eventually being able to reach the surface to burst open, delivering the steam to the air above the water. As it rises the cooler air again condenses the water into tiny droplets (cloud), which rises in the air convection and then evaporates back into invisible steam in air that doesn\u2019t have 100% humidity.
