            "answer_text": "sinking or not, it depend on two factor : Buoyancy force,weight of substance.1.Buoyancy force : It is acting upward in apposite direction of gravity force and it\u2019s magnitude should be \u2018Density of substance *displaced volume by it*g.\u2019 2.Weight = M* g = volume of substance * it\u2019s density * g. Now,simple if net force work downward than substance will be sink whatever may be density . In case of floating , meta-center will take place . three possibilities of meta-center. meta-center above the center of gravity : In this case ,body will be stable equilibrium .It\u2019s means after small tilt in any direction it will be come it\u2019s original state .meta-center below the center of gravity : this is known as unstable equilibrium.It\u2019s means after small tilt it will never come it\u2019s original state . \u201csubstance will be sink.\u201d(-_-).meta-center coincide with the center of gravity: Neutral equilibrium ,it\u2019s means in each and every condition substance will be floating .(*_*).Density does not take place in case of floating and sinking body. I truly hope it helps you. Thank you for reading . ",

            "answer_text": "Whether the substance will sink or float depends on density and the volume of the water that it displaces (pl. see Archimedes\u2019 principle). So, a ball of steel would sink (steel being about 7.8 times denser than water), but a boat or barge made of steel would float because it has much larger surface area and displaces more water. Oils are generally lighter than water and hence would float. Wood is generally less dense than water and would float. ",
