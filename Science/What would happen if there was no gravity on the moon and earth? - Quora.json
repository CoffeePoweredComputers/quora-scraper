            "answer_text": "If the Earth suddenly had no gravity, the Earth\u2019s atmosphere would float into space. Everything not attached to the Earth would fly off into space. Things like trees and most buildings would remain because they are rooted. Since the Earth, itself, is held together by gravity, it would most probably break apart into chunks and float off. With the atmosphere gone, there would be no oxygen, nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Every living thing on Earth would die quickly. Last but not least, with no atmosphere, we would have no protection from solar radiation and the heat and radiation would kill everything. With no gravitation force holding the Earth and moon together, the moon would also float off into space. ",

With no gravity the first few things to happen would be, our atmosphere ejecting immediately into space and killing all life on earth within moments, because of how fast earth is spinning massive chunks of ground, buildings, trees, people and water would be ejected along with the atmosphere. The moon, with no gravity keeping it in orbit would launch into space, carried by momentum from orbiting earth. ",

The Earth and Moon would rip themselves to shreds as they fly off into space and out of the solar system, bypassing the Sun, other galaxies, and supermassive black holes without the slightest bit of resistance (unless they actually hit one of these objects, which is much more improbably than you would think since the universe is incomprehensibly massive). Of course, none of that would matter to us, as we would all be dead. ",

Your question seems to presume that gravity is something that exists \u201con\u201d the earth and the moon. It is probably more helpful to think of it as the earth and the moon existing because of gravity. Gravity is a fundamental part of the laws of physics, so what you\u2019re really asking is: what if physics were fundamentally different? In that case, there would be no earth and no moon, and the universe as we know it wouldn\u2019t exist. ",
