Texas/Area  268,597 mi\u00b2 In precipitation of this next question- Texas is 790 miles long and 660 miles wide at its most distant points. The geographic center of Texas is located in McCulloch County, 15 miles NE of Brady. Texas is bordered by New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Arkansas to the north. The coordinates that mark the state\u2019s center divide Texas into basically what is considered four fairly roughly equal parts. Although the exact location sits on someone\u2019s private land, there a marker containing the tourist information that stands on Highway 377, five miles from the actual geographical center. Brady, Texas's estimated population is 5,309 according to the most recent United States census estimates. Brady, Texas is the 342nd largest city in Texas from the records based on an official 2017 estimate from the US Census Bureau. The basic median age is 39.1 years, 37.6 years for the males, and at 42.2 years for the females. For every 100 females there are 95.6 males.
