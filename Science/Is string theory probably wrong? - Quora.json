            "answer_text": "Hmm\u2026 As I\u2019ve read about the string theory till now, it might seem true. String theory predicts that all the subatomic particles in the universe are made up of vibrating strings. You can try it yourself by pulling a string at different rates. You can watch this video where michio kaku explains it better than me.. :  So after all these research and everything, what I could conclude is that it may be true. BUT\u2026 it might be proved wrong by some other theory in future, who knows??!! It is like we believe in the atomic structure even though we have no idea of how it might look!!!!! Nice question though : ) ",

            "answer_text": "The saying is that string theory is \u201cnot even wrong\u201d. The issue is not whether it is right or wrong but rather whether it can make falsifiable experimental predictions. For example, predict a new particle and what it\u2019s characteristic is. Until now it hasn\u2019t done that and one issue is that there are too many parameters open for \u201ctuning\u201d the results of a measurement therefore the theory can\u2019t make predictions at this stage. Proponents are convinced it is right and ask for patience to let it prove itself. ",
