            "answer_text": "Simple: You make it so the interests of the media align with those of conservatives. The linguist and left-wing activist Noam Chomsky proposed his model of how the American media operates in his 1988 book Manufacturing Consent, coauthored with economist Edward S. Herman. This model is called the propaganda model, and proves to be amazingly effective.  The book lays out five \u201cfilters\u201d through which any media reporting must pass before it makes it to the general public. 1. Ownership \u2014 The reporting of a media corporation will be skewed towards the material interests of its owners. Example: Many of the people who own American media enterprises also have significant stocks in American arms manufacturing, leading to a hawkish stance on military intervention. 2. Advertising \u2014 It will be skewed towards the material interests of corporations that use the publication to advertise. Example: Multinational corporations will air commercials for their products on news networks if they feel these news networks might criticise them. If the media does criticise, they stop advertising there, which means the network loses money. 3. Sources \u2014 It will be skewed towards the material interests of the sources that provide information to the journalists. Example: American news networks tend to be very forgiving towards law enforcement, since the police provides them with a lot of sensational stories. Often they will accept cute stories about policemen saving dogs over instances of police abuse, simply because these stories are readily provided to them. Another example: If a lot of people post about something on social media, media corporations are likely to pick up this story due to the amount of readily available information. 4. Flak \u2014 When a problematic story does come through, corporations may be faced by large and organised resistance against it. Other media companies might frame their reporting in a bad light. Influential think tanks may start publishing materials slandering the company. Readers may start sending angry letters. Example: Stories critical of Israel are often attacked for being anti-Semitic by pro-Israel organisations. 5. Fear \u2014 Fear of an external enemy is a powerful filter over what a media company is able to publish. They cannot be seen publishing stories that make excuses for a perceived enemy. Examples: Attacks on socialism during the Cold War. Attacks on Islam after 9/11. Attacks on Russia nowadays.  If you play into these five factors effectively, you can easily manipulate the media into being more conservative. Conservatives already have a significant advantage in most of them. Media companies are owned by corporations, they are advertised in by corporations, their sources tend to be law enforcement and the military, and fear is characteristic of conservative psychology. ",

            "answer_text": "Sinclair Broadcast Group,owns around 70% of all radio station in America; Sinclair Broadcast Group, is a far right organization! The simple truth is American media is very conservative. To make it more so would lead us further towards a Nazi - donny country. I quote from Wikipedia: Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. is a publicly traded American telecommunications conglomerate which is controlled by the family of company founder Julian Sinclair Smith. Headquartered in the Baltimore suburb of Hunt Valley, Maryland, the company is the second-largest television station operator in the United States by number of stations, owning or operating a total of 193 stations across the country in over 100 markets, many of which are located in the South and Midwest, and is the largest owner of stations affiliated with Fox and ABC. Sinclair also owns four digital multicast networks, sports-oriented cable networks, and a streaming service, and owns or operates four radio stations in the Pacific Northwest. Among other non-broadcast properties, Sinclair also owns the professional wrestling promotion Ring of Honor and its streaming service Honor Club.Wikipedia The 49 senators voting for witnesses in the donny trial represent 19,000,000 (19 million) more people than the 51 who sucked up to donny and Senator McConnell. I'm sure this is a hard concept for you to understand, but the simple truth is the minority within America is destroying the rights of the majority of Americans. ",
