Then, footsteps rush in\u2026  This is Miles, opening the door. He is asked to move his car. Notice the surfboards on the other side. He lives near the beach.  Cut to wide shot, Miles exits in a bathrobe. A. BATHROBE. He is not a dress to impress type of guy.  Notice that all the cars are blue, even for the truck except for his car -- red. This conveys he is different \u2014 odd among his neighbours.  The camera pans from right to left as his car make a turn. This will be important later.  Living room. Dark. Messy. He bursts in, sprints into the kitchen.  Checks the time on a microwave. It\u2019s 10:54 -- shit! -- runs off. He is running late.  Packing as he speaks to his friend on the phone: I\u2019m out of the door RIGHT NOW! Then--  He takes a shit. He doesn\u2019t give a shit about his friend.  He gets out\u2026 to buy himself coffees -- 3 Espressos. This shows he had a drink last night.  Cut to the road, he does crossword. It\u2019s almost done. He knows words. This shows he is a writer.  Dozen cars pass him. There is long traffic behind. He probably drives at 50 right now. Did I mention he is running late?  Reaching the destination, the camera pans from right to left as his car make a turn. Exactly the same way from the fifth shot. This is intentional to show a comparison of his and his friend\u2019s neighbourhood. Poor vs Rich.  Sideways uses \u2018subtlety\u2019 and \u2018show, don\u2019t tell\u2019 to tell a story. If you're looking for a \u2018good\u2019 comedy, Sideways is not only hilarious. It\u2019s delicate.  Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are some of my favorite comedies...Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines  Pic Source: WikipediaYou'll never forget the silly, marching band styled theme song to this 1965 comedy. Made during a period of big budgeted, epic, widescreen comedies with a big cast. Stuart Whitman is charming as the American entry into a multi-national air race between London and Paris in 1910. Sarah Miles, Terry-Thomas, Gert Forde, Benny Hill and James Fox lend fine support. Lots of well arranged, well thought out slapstick as well as low key, charcater driven comedy (James Fox and Whitman are great as romantic rivals forced to share the same breathing space.) At 2 hours 18 minutes, a lot of fun. Dr. Strangelove  Entertainment Weekly called this one of the funniest 100 movies ever made. It also happens to be one of the most disturbing movies made. The humor is right there in your face, however, there is always an underlining political critique under every character, every line, and every government representation. Slim Pickins is the never quit Airman. He is a representative of our entire military system of the time. The president, played beautifully by Peter Sellers, is a demure, calm presence trying to deal with the Russian premiere. His perfect counterpart is a war hungry General, ready to accuse the Russians of any small infraction. This leads to one of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Sellers also plays a British airman who has to deal with the crazed general in the usual polite British manner. Seller's third role is that of the title character, Dr. Strangelove, a former nazi and weapons designer for the Americans. He represents the scientific community of that time period; those who worked tirelessly to build a better bomb. These characters, all of them strongly parodying a cross section of society make for an odd story. The final scene, while played for laughs, is actually a frightening image of a communist future. The final moments are frightening in their truth leading one to put themselves in a position of the characters. Dr. Strangelove is the funniest disturbing film I've ever seen. ",
