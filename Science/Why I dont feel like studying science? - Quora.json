            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t believe in science. You would rather spend your life believing in non-science. This belief gives you a feeling of certainty and security. Most people need the support of others to make decisions for them. We all need some social trust to have rules of morality and common laws. Science cant give you an of that. Science s study natural phenomena, how things work,how to cure disease, how birds fly, how to grow food, How to reach the stars. Little things like learning how survive. These thing took thousands of years to learn and we are not finished. Please don\u2019t study any science. Without the imagination and the persistence, you should try to find a career in something you enjoy. ",
