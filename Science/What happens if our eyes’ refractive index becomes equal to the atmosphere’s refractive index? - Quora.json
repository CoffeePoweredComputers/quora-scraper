            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking Well its an hypothetical question so I can only give answer through physics So let us assume refractive index of our eye became 1 overnight. As we know an image of an object is formed on our retina only when light rays coming from a distant object intersect on our retina cell. Since light rays would be parallel to each other and would intersect at infinity, if not bended towards each other. Since human eyes have biconvex lenses which bend light rays inwards which then forms a real and inverted image on retina. But now refractivity of eye lens is equal to that of air so light rays cannot be bended towards each hence image won\u2019t be formed. Only thing we can see is light of different colour superimposing each other. That\u2019s what I would happen. P.S. If any conceptual mistake feel free to correct. Thank You. ",

            "answer_text": "If by the mistake of god someone get the eyes with refractive index 1 as that of atmosphere (1.0003) then there will be no refraction as well as no total internal reflection inside his eyes.thus he can\u2019t focus on any object.whatever he is seeing and the light rays will directly enters the eyes without being converged. Although the only profit he have is that he can see all the day without closing his eyelids once. Hope u get the answer. ",
