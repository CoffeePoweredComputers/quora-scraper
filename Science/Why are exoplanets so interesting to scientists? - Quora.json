We\u2019d also like to understand our own solar system better. Back in the day it was (reasonably) assumed that we were typical. But to everyone\u2019s surprise we have a unique layout among all the hundreds of solar systems mapped so far. That\u2019s provocative, and it makes it less likely that there\u2019s life out there.
