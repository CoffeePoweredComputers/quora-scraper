            "answer_text": "Novichok agent - Wikipedia \u201cNovichok (Russian: \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043e\u0301\u043a, \"newcomer\"/ \"newbie\" / \"novice, beginner/ new boy\" is a series of binary chemical weapons developed by the Soviet Union and Russia between 1971 and 1993. Russian scientists who developed the nerve agents claim they are the deadliest ever made, with some variants possibly five to eight times more potent than VX, and others up to ten times more potent than soman. They were designed as part of a Soviet programme codenamed FOLIANT. Five Novichok variants are believed to have been adapted for military use. The most versatile is A-232 (Novichok-5). Novichok agents have never been used on the battlefield. The UK government determined that a novichok agent was used in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, Wiltshire, England in March 2018. It was unanimously confirmed by four laboratories around the world, according to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Novichok was also involved in the poisoning of a British couple in Amesbury, Wiltshire, four months later, believed to have been caused by nerve agent discarded after the Salisbury attack. The attacks led to the death of one person, left three others in a critical condition from which they recovered, and briefly hospitalised a police officer. Russia denies producing or researching agents \"under the title Novichok\" (potentially it is documented, produced and ordered in very high secrecy). In September 2020, the German government said that opposition figure and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny, who was evacuated from Omsk to Berlin for treatment in late August after becoming ill during his flight, was poisoned by a Novichok agent. \u201c Basically, this is the weapon that Putin uses when he not only wants to get rid of somebody AND make them suffer as much as possible in the process, but make the entire damn world aware that he did it.

            "answer_text": "There are several nerve agents in the Novichok family, and not a whole lot is known about them in open source materials. As best as I understand it, They are very similar to the VX family that they have an organophosphorus core with a phosgene oxime attached. Or an analog of the phosgene oxime. Yet they are substantially different in some ways which isn't really disclosed, most likely to keep the knowledge away from the general public. And rightfully so, people don't need to be making this stuff for any reason. When you start looking at pesticides with organophosphorus cores, they can be manipulated and attached with other compounds in so many ways that it would make your head spin for years. And unfortunately some russian scientists spun and twisted and tested all kinds of pesticides to figure out which ones would kill human pests that the Kremlin didn't like. From what's known, an agent needs a very small amount of a base chemical compound that is relatively safe and stable, and can mix it with certain widely available chemicals when it's needed. Then they will have a very dangerous poison/toxin when called for. It's generally refered to as a binary agent because of that. ",
