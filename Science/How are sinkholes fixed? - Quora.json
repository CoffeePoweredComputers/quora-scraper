            "answer_text": "There are a number of answers already posted for the closely related question (someone may choose to merge yours with that one): What would you use to fill up a sinkhole in your backyard? The answers flesh out the boilerplate advice given at Florida Department of Environmental Protection: Since anything buried in the earth potentially affects the groundwater, use only native earth materials or concrete for the fill. Broken limestone rip-rap or a concrete plug in the bottom of the sinkhole often helps create a stable foundation for the fill. Above that, add clayey sand to form a barrier that will help prevent water from seeping downward through the hole and enlarging it further. Lastly, add sand and top soil, and landscape to surrounding conditions. Additional fill may be necessary over time, but most holes eventually stabilize. ",
