            "answer_text": "Yes. Nikola Tesla did talk about free energy and he even received two patents for his designs in the year 1901. In the year 1901 he was fascinated by radiant energy and believed that neutron particles are responsible for all radioactive reactions. Radiant energy are re-transmitter of energy from one state to another . This thought led him to develop free energy devices like: radiant energy receiver. The main idea was to derive energy from cosmic rays both in day and night time. The radiant energy receiver consists of two plates, elevated plate (positive) and grounded plate (negative/zero potential). The elevated plate would be exposed to cosmic rays coming from sun and thus will be bombarded with neutrons which will create a potential between the positive and negative and the charge would be stored in a capacitor which will be discharged at regular intervals. Another concept was to derive energy from earth\u2019s electrostatic charge. Tesla the earth along with it\u2019s atmosphere as a huge capacitor where the positive plate is the layer beyond ionosphere which prevents charges coming from entering further and the earth itself as negative/ground. The atmospheric gas and air acts as insulator between these two plates. As per calculation the energy capacity this capacitor is around 4.5 megawatt-hours. In order to use such potential of energy he devised what he called as \u201cenergy sink\u201d which is self-oscillating in nature and would require minimal amount of external energy to keep it going. Tesla received two patents for this radiant free energy device. U.S. Patent No. 685,957 \u2013 Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant EnergyU.S. Patent No. 685,958 \u2013 Method of Utilizing Radiant Energy. Both these patents were filed on March 21, 1901 and granted on November 5, 1901. Sources: Tesla Free Energy Device - The Bifilar Coil - The Green Optimistic ",
