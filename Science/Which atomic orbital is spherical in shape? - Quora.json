            "answer_text": "Well it\u2019s the s subshell that is spherical in shape. There is one orbital in that subshell. There is one spherical subshell for each period. The period is the row number in the periodic table - labelled 1\u20137 in the attached diagram.  For example Hydrogen is in period one of the periodic table (the first row) as is Helium. Hydrogen then has the electron configuration 1s^1 and Helium has the electron configuration 1s^2. Lithium on the other hand is in the second period (row) and has an electron configuration of 1s^2 2s^1. This element has two spherical subshells. Silicon is in the third period and has an electron configuration of 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^2 so it has three spherical subshells and two \u201cprinciple\u201d subshells. When you look up the electron configuration of an element you will know how many spherical shaped subshells there are because that is the number of times the letter \u201cs\u201d appears. The \u201cs\u201d stands for \u201csharp\u201d but s is also the first letter of \u201cspherical\u201d. This is a mnemonic to aid memory, the actual names of the subshells are derived from observation of spectroscopic lines, the \u201cp\u201d stands for \u201cprinciple\u201d, the \u201cf\u201d stands for \u201cfundamental\u201d and the \u201cd\u201d stands for diffuse so don\u2019t think the letters have any bearing on the shapes of the sub shells. In terms of orbitals you can have one orbital in any \u201cs\u201d subshell, which means you can have up to two electrons in that subshell provided they have opposite spin. In the \u201cp\u201d subshell you have three orbitals which means you can have up to six electrons, again two electrons to one orbital provided they have opposite spin. In the \u201cd\u201d subshell you have five orbitals which means you can have up to ten electrons, again just two electrons per orbital provided they have opposite spin. Lastly in the \u201cf\u201d subshell you have seven orbitals which means you can have up to 14 electrons, two electrons to each orbital provided they have opposite spin. ",
