Oceans appear blue not only because water itself is blue but also because seawater frequently scatters light from a blue sky.

The above image is a composite generated predominantly with data fromModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), an instrument mounted on the Terra satellite that has orbited Earth since 1999 December. Sub-areas were imaged only when experiencing cloud-free daylight when it occurred from June through September 2001. The Earth looks much different at night. ",
