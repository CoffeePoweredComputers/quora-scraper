            "answer_text": "\u201cStudying scientifically means using 1) a scientific method and studying 2) natural phenomena. To expand this a bit, the scientific method consists of: I Observation \u2013 Empirical (given to the senses) experience and establishes facts as mutually agreed upon experiences (phenomena); inductive in that past experiences qualify new experiences and are determined by frames of reference; limited in that senses cannot perceive full spectrum of electromagnetic/mechanical signals. II Hypothesis \u2013 A causal explanation for an observation; must be empirically deterministic; may be imaginative and metaphoric, yet deductive in formulation; probabilistic until verified by additional evidence or test results; may be built from prior hypotheses of varying degrees of verification; the best hypotheses rise to the level of law (paradigm) because of continued verification or applicability across broad spectrum of phenomena, but never achieve 100% certainty; same as a theory. III Experiment, Test or Measurement \u2013 Demonstrates in an attempted closed system (controlled variables) whether the hypothesis supports the causal explanation for the observation; with some phenomena not being capable of demonstration and only being measurable. IV Conclusion \u2013 Deductive assessment whether the experiment demonstrated the causal explanation for the phenomena in a closed system; results in a probability statement; hypotheses can be proved absolutely false, but do not achieve absolute truth because all through all time cannot be achieved (induction). V Prediction \u2013 Inductively predicts future encounters with the phenomena will be causally explained by the hypothesis; verification of the hypothesis by the collection of subsequent same or similar evidence though experiment, test or measurement; verification by enumeration contributes to the probability that the hypothesis is true, but absolute proof (truth) is never achieved; often presents the challenge: it ought to be there if you look. VI Consensus \u2013 Agreement among scientists following verification by enumerated conclusions that the prevailing hypothesis is supported by the evidence; establishes the paradigm or ruling theory within scientific categories of study; the most social and political of all steps of the scientific method even though the ends of science are not popularly or democratically determined. Note: This is not \u201cTHE\u201d scientific method as there are many variations based on the kind of phenomena being studied and the research methodology employed. For example, quantum physics is vastly different than geology. \u201cNaturalism\u201d distinguishes the subjects of the sciences from \u201csupernaturalism,\u201d with the point being that nature causes nature. Being able to universally share experience as fact with anyone at anytime (with the proper extension of our senses via technology) establishes a \u201cfact\u201d or mutually agreed upon experience. Even so, our collective experience may be wrong. For example, we say the sun rises and sets, which is not at all what happens. When we look more closely with telescopes and measure what we see against a hypothesis, we see behind the illusions of our shared experiences. ",

            "answer_text": "It means you apply the scientific method to the inquiry. Come up with a hypothesis \u2014 a possible explanation of the phenomenon under study. Then design an experiment. The experiment should remove all variables from the process except the cause under investigation. Now see if measured changes in that cause produce the effect desired. If it does, share the method and results so that other scientists can repeat the experiment and confirm your findings or not. ",

By studying scientifically means studying in a language which the brain understands .In colour , with images ,key words and inter-state connecting curved lines . Studying in a language when it is ready to learn e.g when there is associated instrumental music in the background and for 30 minutes only at a stretch followed by 10 minute relaxation .The brain tires after 30 minutes and hence should be rested before it tires .

It means you want other scientists to try to disprove it even more than you did. It means if other scientists disprove your hypothesis, you abandon it. It means that if your hypothesis survives their attacks, then your hypothesis holds for now. That it\u2019s about as good as it gets. ",
