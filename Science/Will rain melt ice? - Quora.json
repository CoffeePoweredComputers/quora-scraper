            "answer_text": "It depends. In an ice storm, the temperature of the rain that falls is actually below freezing. When it hits something, it freezes, coating it with clear ice. If the rain doesn\u2019t freeze, it will conduct some heat to the ice it falls on, but rain tends to be pretty cold anyway. Around the Pacific Northwest, it\u2019s often just snow that melted as it fell into warmer air. So, it the ice is just at the melting point, and the rain is one degree warmer, it will take rain that is 80 times the volume of the ice to melt it. ",
