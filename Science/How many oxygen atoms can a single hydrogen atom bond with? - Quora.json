            "answer_text": "A hydrogen-bonded OH group can share the hydrogen between two oxygen atoms. The interatomic bond distance in water-ice is the same for both O-H bonds, so the H atom really is being shared between two oxygens. Atoms are not actually joined by straight lines as sketches of a molecule might show. The positive electric charge around a proton acts in all directions and will interact with any oxygen atom that can come within range. More that than 2 oxygen atoms can bond, protons are seriously small, and can fit in anywhere. Logical when you think about it. A proton in aqueous solution exists as a hydrate, i.e, H3O+, so oxygen can and does form trivalent compounds. Also possible are hygher hydrates, [H(H2O)n]+. A similar thing happens with sodium and posassium. Na2O seems reasonable (O2-, oxide) , but potassium more commonly forms KO2 (O^1/2-, superoxide) because K is much larger than O, and 2 potassiums cannot fit around an oxygen. It is not just about cancelling the electrostatic charge, physical effects can also become important. This goes beyond high school and even beyond undergraduate chemistry. What students are taught in school are models that are simplified so that learners can get an idea of what is going on. For many situations, these simplified models present no problems, but when a model fails, a more complete description is needed.However, students try to argue that the theory they were taught is the only one that applies, and really get quite heated trying to defend their own understanding, even when it is incomplete.

            "answer_text": "This question relates to very basic chemistry, therefore a vary basic answer is required. A hydrogen atom has one outer electron and needs one more to complete it\u2019s outer shell, ...therefore it can form only one covalent chemical bond, \u2026therefore it has a valency of 1 (one), \u2026therefore it can combine with only one atom of any element, oxygen included. Oxygen has six outer electrons and needs 2 electrons to complete its outer shell, hence it has a valency of 2 (two), \u2026therefore oxygen can combine (bond with) up to two other atoms. Therefore when hydrogen and oxygen combine to form a covalent molecule, it is usually two hydrogen atoms with one oxygen hence H2O (water)\u2026 H-O-H = water TWO hydrogens can also combine with TWO oxygen atoms if the oxygens also form a bond with each other to make H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide)\u2026 H-O-O-H = hydrogen peroxide (The relationship between outer electrons, valency and types of bond formed are different questions.)
