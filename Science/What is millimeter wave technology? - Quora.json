            "answer_text": "As Technologies used for data communication continuously striving to improve the data rates, the carrier frequency band used in transmission eyes towards 26GHz to 100GHz which falls in the millimeter wavelength range(30GHz to 300GHz) APPLICATIONS: Antenna size became small and easy to fabricateUsed in radar and satellite communicationUses Group III and Group V element for fabrications which makes it more costly thus affordable by military and defense purposesSo they are trying to make use of intrinsic silicon in fabrications to reduce costThey are trying to use mm wave in next generation communication technologiesAs wavelength became comparable to the size of physical circuits, the ordinary circuit analysis like Kirchoff\u2019s law won\u2019t be satisfied and waveguides are used for transmission of signals in the place of interconnects(wire) in the circuit. One should be familiar with Electromagnetic theory to master this mm wave technology. ",
