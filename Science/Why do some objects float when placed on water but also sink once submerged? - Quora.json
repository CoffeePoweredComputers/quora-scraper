            "answer_text": "Why do some objects float when placed on water but also sink once submerged? Well, you must understand a principle discovered long ago by Archimedes called Buoyancy. Early scholars believed that only flat objects could float. Archimedes didn\u2019t just think about it, he ran some experiments to find out. The weight of the water displaced by an object must be more than the weight of the object, or the object will sink in the water. An object which is equal in mass to the mass of an equal volume of water has a specific gravity of exactly 1. Any object (or any other fluid) with a specific gravity less than 1 will float on water. Boats made from heavier-than-water materials float simply because the average specific gravity of the entire boat (including everything onboard) and the air inside the boat below the water line - is less than 1. Fill them up with water and it\u2019s a scene out of the Titanic or Perfect Storm. He also discovered a method to determine the volume of an irregularly-shaped object, and showed that a golden crown was actually gold-plated silver, without having to destroy the crown in the process. I can\u2019t remember which king it was that had commissioned the crown, but surely heads rolled. On Floating Bodies (in two books) survives only partly in Greek, the rest in medieval Latin translation from the Greek. It is the first known work on hydrostatics, of which Archimedes is recognized as the founder. Its purpose is to determine the positions that various solids will assume when floating in a fluid, according to their form and the variation in their specific gravities. In the first book various general principles are established, notably what has come to be known as Archimedes\u2019 principle: a solid denser than a fluid will, when immersed in that fluid, be lighter by the weight of the fluid it displaces. The second book is a mathematical tour de force unmatched in antiquity and rarely equaled since. In it Archimedes determines the different positions of stability that a right paraboloid of revolution assumes when floating in a fluid of greater specific gravity, according to geometric and hydrostatic variations. Archimedes | Greek mathematician Basically, Book 2 describes why your rubber ducky does not float upright. \u201cAny object, wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\u201d - but he said it in Greek, which might have looked like this: \u039a\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf, \u03b5\u03bd \u03cc\u03bb\u03c9 \u03ae \u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b2\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c1\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03be\u03b5\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b4\u03cd\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b7 \u03af\u03c3\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c5\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf. (I have no clue what those words actually sound like, its all Greek to me. Kappa, alpha, theta, epsilon are the first four letters.

Floating a Pin on Water (you don\u2019t have to own a Brita, any water will do just fine, and you can do this with a rolling paper, a pin, and a glass of water in a restaurant to amaze your friends, the rolling paper will soak up water and sink, leaving the pin high and dry on the surface - magicians use all sorts of tricks to take your attention away during slight-of-hand tricks\u2026 this isn\u2019t one of those tricks - the water can be ice cold, it doesn\u2019t much matter, and coca-cola will work, too - but the pin must be dry, and don\u2019t let it touch the edge of the glass or it will sink \u2026 there are bugs that use this trick in nature - one is called a water-walker) The Gerridae are a family of insects in the order Hemiptera, commonly known as water striders, water bugs, pond skaters, water skippers, or jesus bugs. They don\u2019t really float, they just never get wet. They don\u2019t sink when it gets cold outside, either. ",

            "answer_text": "Many are absorbent or otherwise not airtight, so start to fill with water after a while, which causes their weight to increase. As you know, in order for something to float, its total weight must be less than that of the water it displaces. Fill it with water, suddenly the weight of the water gets added to it\u2019s own weight, making it suddenly much heavier than the water, and therefore no longer buoyant. This is why hull breaches on ships are so dangerous. Some objects were never really \u201cfloating\u201d at all, in the strictest sense, but just taking a really long time to sink on account of drag created by their shape, and being submerged allows them to change position and alleviate that drag (similar to how parachutes can slow your descent through air considerably, but only when they\u2019re open and upright). There\u2019s also the surface tension thing, but I confess I don\u2019t understand that particular principal well enough to explain it to you. ",
