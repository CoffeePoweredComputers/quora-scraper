            "answer_text": "You\u2019re kidding, right? The effect would be immediate and catastrophic. The electrical grid, which is 80% dependent on coal and natural gas, would collapse. People in hospitals and nursing homes would begin dying within hours. The system of food distribution would stop dead. The ensuing panic woul engulf the globe in riots. Everything you associate with civilization would disappear completely in weeks to months, to be replaced by tribal warlords. Think Somalia. Even if you replace \u201ctomorrow\u201d in your question with \u201cover the next 12 years\u201d, the answer is much the same. It\u2019s one thing for politicians to yammer about the Green New Deal because they can influence a lot of naive voters that way. But in the world of reality, which is where I choose to live, people will resist the cost and the environmental degradation that would necessarily accompany such a drastic change. The candidates are all blowing smoke. The Green New Deal is simply not possible, and I think they know it. Right now, though, they perceive it as an avenue to power. ",

Once the weather turns cold there would be untold deaths in the temperate regions from people accidentally setting their homes on fire desperately trying to stay warm. Deaths from carbon monoxide poisoning from people using outdoor grills inside their homes? Oh yeah. Global maritime business would come to a screeching halt, with dramatic effects. Near total collapse of rail shipping food to the wholesale and retail markets. The end of modern agriculture as we know it. Vast amounts of garbage on city streets with no trucks to haul it away. None of this would take long at all. Why, did someone tell you it would be a good thing? ",
