            "answer_text": "My answer is a little different than what others have offered. I became good at math by turning it into a game or a toy I was always playing with. Sometimes I would find a magazine with math puzzles appropriate to what I was capable of doing and other times I would make up problems for myself. Whatever else was going on, I tried to do at least a few math puzzles every day. When I came to parts of my math education that were difficult, I would try to circle around the problem in different ways. If the problem was to solve a certain problem in one way\u2014a new way that was giving me trouble\u2014I would try to first solve it using math tools I already had. This circling around was especially helpful if my existing tools took longer or gave not as good of an answer. If someone came to you looking for help with multiplication, you might start by changing the problem to addition. Instead of multiplying 3 x 4, you add four threes together. And then you add three fours together. And then maybe you even add three fives together and subtract three. There are endless ways to attack math problems: the more ways you know and use, the more you will gain insight into what the math is doing under the covers. And the more you will enjoy your own ability to solve difficult problems with ease. Everything I would consider math\u2014so no geometry and no statistics\u2014reduces back to addition and subtraction. If you are unsure how to trace them back, figure it out because until you do, they will remain a mystery and you will struggle. I do not know what type of math problems you are struggling with, but everything up to and including Calculus can be brought back to simple addition and subtraction. ",

            "answer_text": "Before mentioning what to do, I am highly eager to say something. When I was in grade 10, Geology, Biology, and Chemistry deterred me from getting a great overall grade. To be specific, I, unfortunately, got B in Biology and B+ in Chemistry in this year, but Math survived my overall grade to get A. Why did I get deplorable grades in these subjects then? I realized that the logical reason why I got terrible grades in these subjects was that I studied them by virtue of getting exemplary grades. In contrast, what I believed in Math was that I had to read a great deal of information relating to Math because I adore Math not to get a top grade. If you study Math to attain top grades, you will detest this subject to the extent that you will probably give up.  However, only if you aspire to study Math because you adore it won\u2019t inevitably Math be your hindrance. Can you tell me why Steve Jobs was high-status and world-class? You can answer this question! Inescapably, Math always revitalizes my energy when I am depressed! Math riddles are defined as challenges which need appropriate proofs. Therefore, I have an entrenched belief that Math is the best teacher who has educated me what a challenge means. You indisputably need to know why you have to read Math books! You should put this into consideration. Maybe, you are a genius, but you don\u2019t have any urge to study Math; maybe, you are an invaluable asset in Physics. You are supposed to choose which subject you love since provided that you specialize in the major you don\u2019t have any bug to study, you will not contribute to your community. In other words, your life will be mundane. Do you know the brilliant South Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan? He could contribute to the combinatorics field, but how many years did he struggle? These proofs recommend that you identify what you want to be. Afterward, it is well-known that you have to absorb the basics of Math, and I mentioned them before. This is the link \u201cMohamed A.Mohamed's answer to What is the simplest way to study math?\u201d. Finally, Math has explained to me this quote\u201d It does not matter how many times I failed, what matters is that you have reached the zenith of success.\u201d I hope this helps you. ",

            "answer_text": "This is kinda hard to answer since it is very broad, but I\u2019ll try my best to answer your question. I think mathematics is a lot like learning to ride a bike. When you are first learning, you fall a lot, you get frustrated (especially when you see the other kids flying past you.) But why are you falling a lot? Is it because you can\u2019t balance good enough? Or is it because you aren\u2019t going fast enough? These are the essential questions you need to ask yourself when doing mathematics to identify exactly what it is you are struggling with. I admit I struggled with math a lot too. Especially with pure math because it was hard to see the purpose of \u201cFind x.\u201d or \u201cy = x. Find dy/dx.\u201d One way I started to understand math was to connect it to real life examples. (Although that might be easier said than done.) For example: Solving Systems of Equations Real World Problems It helps gain a better appreciation and understanding of the equations and formulas you use. Also, your teacher/professor is a great resource for you. I think it\u2019s best to show them the wrong solution you did so they can see where exactly you are having problems. This also allows for the teacher to work WITH you, instead of just letting the teacher do all the work themselves. Take time to work out examples you did in class on your own and go step-by-step through the problem. Ask yourself questions like: \u201cWhy did we use that equation?\u201d \u201cWhy did we solve for x first?\u201d When I started introduction to physics courses in college I had a mental checklist of steps I\u2019d do to solve a problem. For example: Read the question carefully! Identify exactly what the question is asking me to do.Identify all constants, and unknowns. Knowing what numbers you have and what numbers you need gives you a better understanding of solving the problem. Such as which equations you need. As you do more problems you start to see certain patterns you should follow.If applicable: DRAW A PICTURE.Try to solve. You will probably get it wrong at first but with each failure you start to learn what doesn\u2019t work and what will work.Math is also accumulative. What you learn in algebra, you\u2019ll use in Trigonometry. What you learn in Trigonometry, you\u2019ll use in Calculus. So one reason you might be struggling is because you either forget or were never taught a certain subject that you might be using now. And finally: PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE \u2190- the best thing you can do! ",

Follow these methods I hope they will prove benefical to you. Try to understand the basic concept of a given topic and build upon it do a practice problem and if you made mistakes it is okay it is a stage of learning try to understand why you made those mistakes then deeply understand the ideas correct them and form a solid ground for those concepts, after that apply them to real life situations you can also create your own way of solving questions just for fun :). then steadily increase your difficulty build upon the concepts you previously learn and also do this if you think you faced yourself with a difficult question retreat to your basic ideas or do a question you can easily solve and deeply understand what you did there. Finally, be consistent everything takes time just think positive, be happy and enjoy. ",

            "answer_text": "The other contributors did a good job of answering this, but i will add one thing i think is important. Don\u2019t be afraid to go back as far into basic math as you need to and work forward again to understand an concept or procedure that is stopping you from moving forward. I think of this like a fill in the blank puzzle. write down the parts you understand and leave a blank for the parts you do not. Then go down a level more basic and see what the part you don\u2019t understand comes from. Then go another level down until you find something you do understand. Then work forward again until you get the understanding to fill in the blank in your problem. As I stated before, all math problems can be written out in clear language that is non-mathematical (using words for the numbers and symbols). For people who struggle with understanding math the most important thing before solving the problem is knowing what the problem is that you are solving. Make the effort to convert the problem into a format you understand so that you can create understandable problem and then you can apply logic (as stated in one of the other answers) to construct your solution. Then bring it back to your mathematical symbols for the end solution. I hope this helps ",

I was considering that I had hated math all my childhood but now I realize that the object of my detestation wasn't mathematics. It was school and unprofessional teachers who had been having the access to teach. My experience with math lessons was bad. I got terrible grades, I was nervous every test, I was disapponted and just gave up. I thought my mind wasn't set up to understand even basic concepts, that I am born to not be good at math, that it's just my will. Now I know that everybody's able to learn math and nobody really hates it. One thing you can be struggling with is the educational system: schools, pressure from parents, those teachers, even your classmates who's doing well. All this creates your main problems. The rest is your motivation, intention and wish to descover. If you want, you can. Do not care about grades, exams, schools. And ask yourself the question: Why should you learn math? If you found an answer, get started. ",
