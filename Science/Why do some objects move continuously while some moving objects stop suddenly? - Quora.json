            "answer_text": "Because of friction.  Friction is a force that acts in the opposite direction to the motion. Here\u2019s a little experiment that you can do right now:Take a pen and push it on a carpet,calculate the distance it moved.Then do the same thing on a flat surface like a table or floor.You\u2019ll notice that the pen moves further on a smooth surface rather than on a rough one,because there is less friction there. Now do the same thing with a smooth glass.Again you\u2019ll notice that when a smooth object moves through a smooth surface there is less friction(object moves further without stopping) than when a rough object moves through a smooth surface. This is all considering that there\u2019s no other force acting on an object.Newton\u2019s First Law states: An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force (Newton's Laws) So to answer your question: The reason why some objects move for a longer period of time than others is because of a force known as friction. Fun fact: If you throw a ball in space it\u2019ll (probably) move on forever if not affected by planet\u2019s and star\u2019s gravity. Any corrections and suggestions are more than welcomed. ",

            "answer_text": "Some moving objects encounter opposition to their movement\u2026 the opposition can be quite strong and abrupt. For details, I would need an example. I take it you are not puzzled about how some people keep walking, some speed up and slow down, and some suddenly stop? I take it you are not puzzled about why a car comes to an abrupt stop when it hits a wall, while the car next to it, missing the wall, keeps going? So what are you talking about? ",
