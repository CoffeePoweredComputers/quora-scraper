            "answer_text": "This pandemic has been a learning experience all around the world. Will it change the status of the United States as \u201cGlobal Leader\u201d? Who says the Global Leader can\u2019t play the fool, stumble and blunder, and commit colossal mistakes costing the lives of many innocent people? Being the Global Leader doesn\u2019t confer infinite wisdom. Having immense power doesn\u2019t mean it will necessarily be used properly. In fact it\u2019s just the opposite; the possession of great power makes it more likely it\u2019ll be abused. Power corrupts. The US still has the largest economy in the world:  If we include the EU as a separate economic entity (GDP, US$millions):  From: List of countries by GDP (nominal) - Wikipedia From this we see the US economy accounts for nearly a quarter of the entire world GDP. Even though china is rising fast, the US still swings a preponderant weight. The US also has the most powerful military in the world by a significant margin, and generates a disproportionate amount of scientific, cultural and technological innovations. That doesn\u2019t change, despite the utter incompetence of the Trump administration and the disgraceful behavior of Donald Trump. His corruption, dishonesty, ignorance and stupidity have brought shame upon the nation, and has put the entire world at risk, but that doesn\u2019t mean the US is no longer the global leader. The way Trump has mismanaged the corona virus plague will cost thousands of innocent people their lives. His blunders will also have an enormous economic impact. But such mistakes are hardly unique. The Bush/Cheney invasion of Iraq caused even greater damage. That didn\u2019t mean the US was no longer the global leader; it just showed that the leading nation had the power to do the most harm as well as the most good. The Bush/Cheney precedent illustrates another important point: without their criminal malfeasance, it\u2019s unlikely that Barack Obama would have been elected. We\u2019ll see a similar effect from this debacle. Electing Trump in 2016 was a monumental mistake on the part of American voters, and the blood on his hands from the covid-19 pandemic has made that painfully obvious. The bloody virus-loaded mucus staining his legacy will be a reminder in the decades to come: electing a criminal huckster as president is a very bad idea. Elections have consequences, and the virus has made it abundantly clear that a malignant narcissist infesting the White House can make those consequences fatal. The next president will be an anti-Trump, who has to undo the damage caused by the Conman-in-Chief. We\u2019ve seen how much harm can be done by the Global Leader under malign leadership. Next we\u2019ll see how much good can be done when we\u2019re working to make things better. ",

            "answer_text": "The Covid-19 pandemic is both an opportunity\u2014and a chance to fail big time. The opportunity lies in the fact that we finally have a functioning Congress and Senate. Isn't it amazing to watch what happens and how quickly it does, when legislators feel the cold breath of the Grim Reaper on their necks? So they can do things rapidly, but the question is: will it improve our long-term well being? Unfortunately this disease is making us choose in very stark terms between the needs of older Americans, vs younger Americans, in that the physical risks from Covid-19 are concentrated dramatically in those over 70, but it's the ages under that who will pay the highest economic price in futures canceled. (See these figures from the Korean CDC, who as of this writing, have the best data. KCDC ) Since older people own more assets, maybe everyone will see that their long term interests are aligned. Will the leadership emphasize supporting industries and ways of doing things that are firmly rooted in the past and are withering away to the detriment of our future? Unfortunately, considering where Donald Trump received most of his support, in older, rural populations rooted in an extractive, and manufacturing past, the prognosis is not good. Already you can see the outlines of some terribly destructive decisions in trade and on technology. Even in the midst of this terrible crisis, for example, Peter Navarro is taking it upon himself to put more restrictions on an already hammered American semiconductor industry as it pertains to trade with Asia, insuring a small and shrinking slice of the growing demand for semiconductors all over the world. God help us all, he has been even been anointed the tsar over covid-19 federal decisions by Trump. It is very likely that this president has sown the seeds of our eventual destruction already, but it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. There is a hope, however small, that we can change course, and instead of heading to a dark, obsolete, and fearful past, we could head for the sunny uplands of the future. The second, and even larger, stimulus bill that will be working its way through the political process over the next month may be our last hope. Instead of mortgaging our future up to our neck to support a past that is being relegated to the trashcan of economic progress, we can invest in the future instead. What does that future look like? There are three main components to Humanity's rise from a past that was nasty, brutish, and short. Inexpensive energy, transportation, and communications technology. These things allowed for an explosion in the standard of living for almost everyone on the planet. Unfortunately we are constrained in the area of energy as we have reached the limits of what we can put, as a side effect, into the environment in producing and consuming that energy. In order to enhance the supply of energy we need to look to sources other than hydrocarbons. So that means we could put a lot of usefully employed capital in offshore wind, where there is the potential for twice the amount of electric power that we use today, onshore wind, and solar which also has huge potential. We also need to look at 4th generation nuclear for baseload power, as well as storage, and fund hydrogen fusion much more than we are doing today. All of these energy technologies have enormous capital requirements, yet lead to a much-improved standard of living, typified by a very low cost of energy that isn\u2019t dependent on the decisions of dictators or a small group of investors, and most importantly--one that doesn't result in an unlivable planet. The other area of deficit in capital expenditure is transportation. We need to think intelligently about what we really need in transportation, and invest accordingly, especially considering that covid-19 has put certain trends in overdrive, such as shopping online, and working from home. And finally, we need to completely stitch together the entire country with either fiber optics, or some combination composed of 5G or low Earth satellite like the one from SpaceX, and drive a stake in the heart of this difference in internet performance between rural and city environments. As an aside, does anyone at this point think that our main defense problems come from other nations? We need to re task part of the defense department for biological defense, and this is an institution that would work hand-in-glove with other similar organizations throughout the planet, so we never get caught with our shorts around our ankles like we did this time. So rather than wasting capital paying people who would rather work to stay home and watch Netflix, we could make some progress in these areas, and get something for our money, even with the constraints of covid-19, which we will find a way around, probably through testing and information technology initially, and then via accelerated vaccine development.
