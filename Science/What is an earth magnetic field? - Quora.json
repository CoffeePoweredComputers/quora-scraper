            "answer_text": "Earth s magnetic field always fascinates us to think something about earth, Galaxy,and some celestial bodies\u2026. Our Earth has an invisible force field not exactly invisible but a gigantic magnetic field which surrounds the earth and acts like force field \u2026 But what exactly this magnetic field do? OR what happened if it doesn't exist? So basically this field protects earth and all the life exist on earth from space radiation. And the biggest culprit is suns solar wind.  Have you ever thought about a freely suspended bar magnet which always points in N-S direction even in the absence of any other magnet\u2026 This happens because of earth.Earth itself behaves as a magnet which causes a freely suspended magnet to move in N-S direction.  Shape of Earth's magnetic field resembles the field of bar magnet. The south pole of Earth's magnetic field is in geographic north of suspended bar magnet i.e magnetic south pole is near geographic north the north pole of earth magnetic field is in geographic south pole i.e magnetic north pole is in geographic south pole . Some interesting facts\u2026. Axis of Earth's magnet and the geographical axis do not coincide with each other .Hence axis of Earth's magnetic field is inclined at an angle of 15 degree with the geographical axis.As they do not coincide with each other, therefore a freely suspended magnet doesn't show exact geographic north and south .",

            "answer_text": "The Earths magnetic field is the field produced by the spinning iron core at the center of the Earth. The core of the earth is basically a dynamo. It is responsible for being able to use a compass to define north and south. Not as accurately as a GPS but good enough for hiking and such. It protects our atmosphere from being stripped away by radiation from the sun. It creates the northern and southern lights. It protects us from a lot of different types of radiation. Basically it is one of the main reasons we developed into thinking (I use that term loosely) creatures on this planet.
