            "answer_text": "Because a pulsar is a neutron star.  A pulsar is a specific type of neutron star that is highly magnetized, rotating, and emits a beam of EM radiation.  If that beam of radiation happens to be pointed toward us, we can see it as an intermittent \"pulse\" of energy, hence a \"pulsar\". So there is no neutron star in a pulsar, just that the pulsar is a neutron star.   ",
