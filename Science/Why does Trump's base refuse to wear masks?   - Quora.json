            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not just Trump\u2019s base, there are plenty of swing voters, and I\u2019m sure even some Democrat voters who refuse to wear masks as well. There are a variety of reasons: Logically, people who live in areas that mostly vote Republican have relatively low population densities, so they are the least likely to contract COVID, mask or not. That\u2019s where the logic ends though. I\u2019ve seen people say that masks don\u2019t protect you from water droplets, despite mountains of evidence otherwise;People who compare medical facemasks to other facemasks and claim that they\u2019re the same thing, and because other masks aren\u2019t effective, then medical ones can\u2019t be either despite non-medical masks not being designed for medical purposes;People who claim that the virus isn\u2019t real, or that it\u2019s not as serious as the statistics say it is, so don\u2019t feel the need to wear a mask as they don\u2019t believe anyone\u2019s seriously at risk;People who are just following by example, seeing prominent anti-maskers not wearing masks and trying to emulate them;People who mistakenly think that the masks are only to protect themselves and they don\u2019t care if they get sick;People who believe that masks restrict airflow, again, despite all evidence against that belief;People who believe in crazy conspiracy theories;People claiming that it\u2019s unnatural to wear a mask because God didn\u2019t cause humans to be born with one attached to their faces;To simply people who just don\u2019t want to wear one because they feel that it\u2019s their right to do whatever the hell they want to.At the end of the day though, as I see it, it all boils down to people not being used to wearing masks, finding it uncomfortable, not even trying to get used to wearing one, and them not giving a crap about anyone other than themselves. Stubbornness and self interest are the root cause. ",

            "answer_text": "Because we realize that the scare is a political ploy. There is little significant change in the total number of deaths in the US from month-to-month. We realize that those who are vulnerable and with pre-existing conditions are at the greatest risk. We also understand that they need to be protected. The largest number of COVID deaths are associated with comorbidity. Many Trump supporters are educated enough to realize that wearing masks has little to no effect on the transmission. If one is observant enough, they will realize the multiple breaches of \u201ccontactless\u201d transactions. In addition, we are wary of those that try to step on our freedom. ",
