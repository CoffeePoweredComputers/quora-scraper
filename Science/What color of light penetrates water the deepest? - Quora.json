            "answer_text": "Light doesn\u2019t penetrate what is called water, which isn\u2019t strictly H20. The first metre depth of most of the world\u2019s ocean surface is the largest conjoined ecosystem, all consisting of microbial organisms, on the planet. Light is deflected in what is called water, as it is from solid objects. Divers who stray down to deep enough depth are familiar with essentially pitch black environment, zero light. The light is deflected about and around not far below the surface of any body of water. Light doesn\u2019t have distinct colours in its colour band range. It has wavelengths that segue from the appearance of reddish or greenish or yellowish and others with no distinct boundary. And each of these apparent colours requires functioning human eyesight system and neurophysiology to receive, process and interpret as perceived colours. No human can see the colours that any other human can see. Each human sees their own optical visage. Due to stable evolution, humans of sound eyesight see the same optical light band presentation, such that a red, yellow or green street light is the same optical data for everyone and is proven every time motorists stop for a red light or go at a green that each understand what the optical presentation means, in whichever language or configuration. Light energy is redirected on interaction with H2O and microbes. The term \u201ccontact\u201d is almost inexcusable in its fallacy. Photons, as light is alleged to consist of, would have to smash into something to contact. \u201cOops. My bad. Please accept my humblest apologies as an unworthy photon for crashing unannounced into your courageous doughty H20 molecule self.\u201d No. Even in perceived matter-on-matter collision, unless launched at near light speed, the energy field surrounding some matter bounces off another energy field surrounding another material object. The true strength and resilience of standard molecular bonding is demonstrated by particle accelerators that bust up molecules into individual atoms by manipulation from close to light speed collision. It requires just about speed of light to forcibly debond atoms from their natural molecular state. Photons, also theory as molecules and atoms are, are different. They are considered individual units of massless energy with no reasonable explanation given. What does the Sun emit? Science doesn\u2019t know or knows how bricks fall to the ground or how people can hold and write with a pen. Science doesn\u2019t know how Earth was formed. How the Moon got there. Electromagnetic Spectrum radiation, gravity, these and more, supercede human brain ability to grasp and understand. Many find this infuriating. But EMS radiation, which remains a mystery, that transits through the molecules in the atmosphere, whatever the EMS may be, is deflected from its preceding path and deflected again and again and again until departs upward from what is only loosely referred to as water.

            "answer_text": "Probably the water is transparent which means it absorbs all the light colors and could reflects any one or all of them like the rainbow in the sky. It depends on the angle of refraction, reflection and the index of water. The water of the sea is always transparent but looks approx. blue because the sky atmosphere above is blue and there is sand and rocks down there that block the passage of light where the sea water is like mirror it reflects the light of the sun in the deepest sea that give them a tone of refraction sometimes to blue tones where there will be also a kind of reflection like a mirror; and at night where there is no light it looks dark because it is transparent. So it depends on the light projected also in water if it is for example green it will absorb all the colors except the green one and you see the water light source penetration faster as a green tone because water is transparent. The water is like the transparent medium like the glass, the light will penetrate easly and partially of its source color. The extreme white and birght lights can deeply dive in water. Sometimes all photons light and darkness itself can deeply faster dive in water. It depends on the frequencies of light or the wavelength and the angle of refraction within that are considered the faster one. Besides if you took a prism the rainbow color will be mixed together to reflect out the white colors which is the mix of all the colors in an angles of deviation from the density index reflection inside the medium.
