            "answer_text": "All the elements of Group 1 react vigorously with water to give metal hydroxides and liberate hydrogen gas, but this reactivity increases down the group. Lithium's density is only about half that of water, so it floats on the surface and ultimately disappears, giving off hydrogen gas and forming a colourless solution of lithium hydroxide. But unlike the rest of the s-block elements, this reaction is not vigorous. 2Li(s)+2H2O(l)\u21922LiOH(aq)+H2(g) Using Hess\u2019s Law, we can split it into several theoretical steps with known enthalpy changes. Atomisation energy:Li(s)\u2192Li(g); \u2206H=+ve Ionisation energy:Li(g)\u2192Li+(g)+e\u2212; \u2206H=+ve Hydration enthalpy:Li+(g)\u2192Li+(aq); \u2206H=-ve The reasons for the slow and non-explosive reaction of Li with water are: As we move down the group, as atomic size increases, atomisation energy and ionisation enthalpy decrease and as such, their values are quite high for Li or we can say that the energy to be supplied for the reaction to take place (activation energy) is quite high. Even though, the value of hydration enthalpy (-ve) is also higher for Li than other elements of the group, the reaction releases heat very slowly, so activation energy has to be supplied first and is then later recovered. More activation energy means slower reactions and less vigorous reactions.The reaction generates heat slowly, and Li has a high melting point, too high for it to melt.As far as being less reactive than the Group 2 elements of the s-block is concerned, it follows the same logic. Be and Mg would have been exceptions as reactivity with water decreases across a period but they have a protective layer of oxide on their surfaces, so they react only at very high temperatures and are largely inert towards water.

            "answer_text": "Why do elements react ? Electrons will always move towards region which have minimum energy. Have you ever thought why only the outermost or valence electrons participate in reactions and not the inner core electrons? The reason for this is potential energy of electrons. The electrons which are near to the nucleus get more attraction and thus have lesser potential energy and are also the most stable. The electrons of the valence shell are among the one to get the least attraction and thus have maximum potential energy and least stable. Now if through any means you are providing an opportunity to the electrons to lower its potential energy it will certainly do that. Thus when you add any alkali metal or alkali earth to water or acid what you do is provide an opportunity to the very unstable valence electron of alkali to get stable by entering in to H+ ion present in the acidic solution as well as in water. When the electron of alkali enter the H+ ion it goes into 1s shell which is nearest to the nucleus. The electron of alkali which was getting less attraction will now get much more attraction inside the H+ ion forming Hydrogen atom. The two hydrogen atoms formed combine to form Hydrogen molecule. Now how fast this reaction takes place depends on how fast and easily this valence electron comes out of alkali atom and enters the H+ atom to form hydrogen gas. As compared to other Alkali metals, the last electron of lithium gets much more attraction because it is at the nearest distance from the nucleus. This makes the process less vigorous as electron does not comes as easily as compared to other alkali. We can also say that the valence electron of lithium is not as unstable as valence electron of other alkali metals.   At Open Science Forum we are trying to make science as much fun as possible. Here are couple of interesting examples:  Here is the facebook link to know more : Open Science Forum | Facebook ",
