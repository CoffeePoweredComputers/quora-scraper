            "answer_text": "Russia is usually good in lying. At least so that it's hard to blame Russia as the state (in lying). You'll find a lot of Russian public figures providing lies, but state officials are usually more careful in their statements, more like 'where are your proofs, those proofs aren't proofs\u201d and distractions like \u201cwhat about \u2026 in (some other country)\u201d. So you can't charge them until proven. But a country doesn't really need proofs to do some sanctions if it believe they're justified. International relations aren't like in-state business and courts.
