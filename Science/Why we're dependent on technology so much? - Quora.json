            "answer_text": "Einstein was asked about technology. Without blinking Einstein answered: \u201cI fear the day that technology will surpass our human interaction. The world will have a generation of idiots!\u201d  TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING  I. TECHNOLOGY: the THIEF of ATTENTION  A few weeks ago, over dinner, my uncle Paul randomly blurted: \u201cGenius . . . guess what?\u201d A raised eyebrow spoke on behalf of my lips. \u201cI tried to take this here damn boy . . .\u201d he paused to point at my teenage cousin, \u201cwith me on a camping trip!\u201d \u201cCool,\u201d I shot back. \u201cGlad to hear brothas are camping nowadays.\u201d Uncle Paul shook his head. \u201cMan instead of us having some good ol\u2019 father & son bonding time, this fool spent the whole damn day on his phone!\u201d That\u2019s when my cousin Donald spoke up. \u201cPop . . . hey, at least I was with ya on the trip. Sheesh!\u201d \u201cYea right,\u201d barked my uncle, \u201cyour body was on Earth but your mind was on Mars.\u201d Bingo! After all,  The entire human experience takes place in the mind. For this reason, if society primarily directs its attention to the various technological devices\u2014ranging from social media to TV\u2014no wonder it has become commonplace to see this:  Ahhh, say hello to Mr. Technology, aka the Thief of Attention! Long gone are the days when families huddled together around a warm fireplace to enjoy a warm meal, all for the sake of warm conversations. If I had a penny for each time my mouth busied itself running while my eyes glimpsed over to another\u2014whose eyes were glued to the phone screen\u2014 why I\u2019d be officially the Negro Jeff Bezos! Sheesh. But here\u2019s the most troubling thing about relying too much on technology: if the chief aim of life is in fact to:  Well, clearly, to know thy Instagram . . . To know thy Facebook . . . To know thy Quora . . . Have all taken precedence over the very purpose of human life! If Socrates were alive today, after spending a few minutes in the midst of HD TV screens and Google alerts . . . he would be compelled to shake his head before reminding us that:   II. In CLOSING  Einstein . . . with the third eye of genius . . . almost a century ago had already foreseen the pitfalls of technology. After all, technology is a rich servant but a poor master. Whereas the sole function of technology is to aid humanity in its quest for self-development, the reverse seems to have occurred. After all, the last time I visited a meditation retreat, there were fewer than a dozen of us.  On the other hand, when the latest iPhone was released, the line was so long I couldn\u2019t help but wonder: Sheesh . . . has Jesus returned and Elvis is singing his entrance music inside the Apple store or what?  Ahhh, a perfection of means, and confusion of aims, seems to be our main problem. \u2026 Bingo! Here lies the truth why as a society we rely too much on technology. After all,     DOG fo DNIM ehT ",

            "answer_text": "Just think, what would happen if your computer, iPad, or laptop crashed today? What if someone took away your phone for some days or perhaps you lost it? If thinking about these incidences makes you stressed, you are not alone. Today, most people are so into technology that losing it would alter their life negatively. And this phobia extends beyond IT devices as well. Consider if automobiles, trucks, trains and aircraft had their electronics fried by an enemy setting off an Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP), or taking down our GPS satellites. What would we do? We are rapidly becoming dependent on many forms of technology. This can be proved by the fact that most of us cannot go for a minute without looking at our phones and the fear of the battery dying is immense. But, do we need it? It\u2019s hard to resist the benefits it comes with. Society may have gone so far in technology dependence that it has become so immense that doctors have recommended \u201ctechnology detox.\u201d Perhaps you may have heard of it. If not, according to Oxford Dictionary, Technology Detox is a period during which an individual avoids using any electronic devices including computers, smartphones, etc as a chance to reduce stress and focus on social interaction in the outside world. On top of this, technology is changing quite fast. After a few months, we have an old product replaced by a new version which is even faster and smarter. For those who work in an office, think of a day without an internet connection. For employees, this may be a good time to wander around because there are no new tasks, but consider the stress that comes with this. Is there nothing that can be done without computers, Internet connections, video conferencing? At home, think of a weekend with no television and cell phone. Actually, these items have become a part of our lives that is indispensable. There is a drastic change compared to an earlier era where kids used to spend a lot of time with each other or parents, playing or just sharing stories. Those evening games after school are over, watching cartoons on a Sunday or playing with friends are no longer there. Today, more than 75% of kids remain indoors playing computer games or with a smartphone. Technology has filled all our time. Most of the time we now spend worrying about issues such as, is my phone charged enough? Does my camcorder have enough charge to record the live event? If one of them is missing, you try as much as possible to search for it no matter what. The result is that you fail to capture and experience the moment since you are busy worried about other things. From a psychological viewpoint, consider this 2019 article: Why Reliance on Technology is a Bad Thing. \u201cBecause we, as a society, are embracing technology without fully understanding the long-term ramifications of this decision. We\u2019re constantly seeking out short-term gains and improvements without really taking into consideration the whole picture for future generations. \u201cComputers are great, don\u2019t get me wrong. They are wonderful tools that help many simplify their life, get more information, and in the end, hopefully make better, more informed decisions. These better informed decisions hopefully lead to better lives (for people) or better revenues and increased profits (for companies). But computers are not always the right choice, even when they appear to provide a solution to an existing problem. \u201cAs a tool, a computer is a useful aid. It has helped architects and engineers design and provide more reliable, interesting structures and buildings. It allows us to split atoms, and categorize human genomes. It can take guesswork out of business intelligence and product demand curves. It even allows us to exchange money in the form of bits and bytes instead of actual paper money changing hands. \u201cBut as a foundation for an important enconomic pillar in our country, I suspect we\u2019re pushing the envelope of sane thinking. There is no such thing as an unhackable computer system. There is no such thing as a 24/7/365 computer system (despite what some companies claim). And until there is, putting all of your eggs into a computerized future seems a bit short-sighted to me. \u201cImagine a power outage. You know, the kind we had just a few years ago on our supposedly modern power grid. The kind that isn\u2019t supposed to happen. The kind that brought an entire coast of our country grinding to a halt. That\u2019s fine, you say, those things are freak occurrences, and happen once in awhile. Like the California blackouts of a few years ago. \u201cBut as our thirst for power increases, and our infrastructure fails to keep pace with it (and it really is nowhere near to keeping pace with it \u2014 it is doubtful the U.S. has enough reserve electricity supplies without tapping into our neighbors from the north during peak usage periods). Now, instead of just going a few days without power, imagine an entire society devoid of electricity. Could it happen? For a few days, sure. But for a few weeks or even longer?? Who knows? The question in my mind isn\u2019t if such a thing is possible, but simply when. \u201cNow, fifty years ago, architects and engineers could keep on working, since they used their drafting boards and graph paper to create the structures that hold us up. The NYSE could go on running using good old-fashioned paper and pencil, just like they did then. Citizens could use cash instead of charge or debit cards to pay for goods and services. The point is, fifty years ago, I think society could easily survive and overcome a lapse in electricity even for a long period of time. It was inconvenient, but the basics of daily life (and the basics of our economy!) didn\u2019t depend on electricity being reliable and abundant. \u201cAll of that has changed. I suspect some new architects wouldn\u2019t know how to design a 50-story building on paper (without aid of a CAD program), or a doctor who had to diagnose a patient without the reliance on ordering 10 or 15 lab tests. Or a politician who couldn\u2019t rely on instant polling techniques. Or citizens who had to resort to reading their news, instead of watching in on TV. Or an important stock exchange not being able to function because generators were never meant to be used full-time, indefinitely. \u201cAs a tool, I think computers are the cat\u2019s meow. But as this something more they\u2019ve become, this integrated component that so many people have become dependent upon, I am sometimes a little worried or concerned. We believe we live in a largely stable world, with virtually endless supplies of natural resources. And yet that belief isn\u2019t grounded in reality \u2014 we live in a limited-resource world where, one day (perhaps in some of our\u2019s future), some of those resources may very well run out or dwindle significantly. \u201cSo it\u2019s a simple equation: limited future natural resources means limited supplies of electricity, the stuff that powers our modern world\u2026we\u2019ve all been waiting for a breakthrough in energy production for decades and none has come. Nuclear was the last big one with commercial realization, and that was developed more than 50 years ago!\u201d ",
