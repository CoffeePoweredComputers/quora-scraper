But now, many times now they are built in the lab and tested through specific guidelines set by the USDA (for approved molecules) Observation in nature as was done for penicillin\u2026it was observed that near this mold, Penicillium notatum\u2026bacterial colonies didn,t form yet they did away from the area near the fungus. The mold was studied and the molecule penicillin was named and future advancements in technology mapped the molecular structure. With the structure known, chemists can try formulating similar base molecules w/ slightly different \u201cR\u201d groups (e.g. the difference in having a single H compared to another methyl group [CH3] in it\u2019s place can show a 5 fold increase in activity in some specific circumstances).
