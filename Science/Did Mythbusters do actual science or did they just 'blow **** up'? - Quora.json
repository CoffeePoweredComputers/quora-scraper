            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve long maintained that Mythbusters is the best science programme ever made. Yes, it\u2019s entertainment and yes, they did have a bit of an obsession with guns and explosions that got a bit tiresome to me. But they captured the core essence of science, which is: \u201cI think this is true. Is it true?\u201d. The show revolves around the basic principle that you don\u2019t have to be happy with speculation, you can actually go out there and find things out using careful experiments. What\u2019s more, they make that very process seem thrilling. I wouldn\u2019t doubt that more people have become scientists by watching the show than a hundred more serious documentaries. Also, in reference to a number of responses that mention peer review, I\u2019d argue Mythbusters does have a process of peer review, because of their extremely active engagement with their audience, especially the episodes where they review criticisms of earlier experiments and re-do them. That\u2019s exactly what peer review is about: you openly publish your hypothesis, your method and your results, and anyone is free to examine it and see if they agree with you, or to try the same experiment themselves.

            "answer_text": "Mythbusters followed the scientific method, even if they were not always clear about what they were doing and how they were doing it. That method is the hallmark of science. They formed a hypothesis. They conceived of an experiment to test that hypothesis. The experiment included controls, to demonstrate that the effect was real and made a difference. They documented their results. What they did not do (or more frequently, not show) was the boring parts: setting up experiments can be hard. Getting the experiment to produce any result is frequently challenging. And they did not show what we call \u2018rigor\u2019: the care to be certain that nothing else was affecting the results, plus the precision to demonstrate the quantitative errors in their results. So, bottom line, what they did was science. It was entertaining, it was informative, and it was grossly sloppy. Not a bad tradeoff. ",

            "answer_text": "They did real science, and then they blew it up. Of course, the \u201cscience\u201d was constrained by budget and the need to do an entertaining TV show. But the basic elements were all there. They had a hypothesis (or YouTube video), they attempted to test it. They usually tested it several times, but only the most visually entertaining results actually made it from the clipping room. They rarely, if ever, did proper statistical analysis, but if they had done, and gone on to show it, the show would be remembered for its ability to induce sleep in audiences. Nothing they did would be accepted for publication in a scientific journal, of course, but that wasn\u2019t the level they were aiming for: they were aiming for visually entertaining, but definitely bona fide, evidence by using the bare bones of the scientific method. And absolutely, often they didn\u2019t need to do it very thoroughly. They simply asked the question \u201cis this possible\u201d, and once they had done it (and documented it properly), the answer was known to be \u201cyes\u201d; once was enough to demonstrate it beyond the anecdotal evidence of possibly doctored YouTube videos. And, of course, some of the best episodes were more of engineering. The Desert Island Duct Tape episode wasn\u2019t so much science as\u2026 well, duct tape. And if they felt it wasn\u2019t exciting enough, they just applied some C4. ",

For instance, in one episode, they asked the question, \u201cwhich is better for fighting zombies, a gun or an axe?\u201d When they did the comparison, only Jamie used the gun and only Adam used the axe. The problem with this experimental set up is that the two of them differ in their skills and athletic abilities. Now I\u2019ve watched a lot of Mythbusters and I can tell you that even though he\u2019s tubbier, Adam is actually the more athletic of the two. So the two results are not comparable. The proper way to conduct this experiment would be to have both of them try both weapons and then average the results. ",

Another one was \u2018Tree catapult\u2019, where they tested successfully in small scale, but chopped off the most useful (springy) part of the tree in large scale.

            "answer_text": "I've caused one explosion and seen more 5ft flames than the general public will ever see. No one has never accused me of not doing real science. Pretty much any popular science programme you see on tv is not scientific. The \u201cexperiments\u201d that they perform are never good enough for the definitive answers they claim to show. Even when they use caveats, they don't tell you that those caveats are so important that it invalidates their conclusions. That is not to say that they are useless. Far from it. These tv programmes do incredible work as science outreach mechanisms, getting children excited about science and educating science. Both of those aspects are essential for society. The experiments just aren't scientific, that is all. ",

Obviously they are constrained by practicalities of the format and the need to create entertainment and so often their experiment lack which you might call full scientific rigour but generally not to a ridiculous degree. The sort of things they do are certainly not too bad when considered as an initial attempt to determine whether an ideas has any merit or not as opposed to thoroughly studying it, and to be fair they tend to be quite good at examining and pointing out the limitations of their tests. I think they are also very good in terms of communicating that \u2018common sense\u2019 isn\u2019t always a good way to come to conclusions and that the scientific method is an effective way of testing ideas and achieving useful results. I many ways though what they do is more like engineering and technology than \u2018pure\u2019 science. ",
