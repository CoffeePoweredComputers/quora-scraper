            "answer_text": "White light is a superposition of all the colours in the visible range of the spectrum. And since wavelength of light depends on the refractive index of the material it passes through, each wavelength travels with a different speed in the prism and thus displays various colours. The reason why we see a spectra is mainly because of the refractive index dependence of the wavelength of light. This means, light with different wavelength travels with different speeds in a medium of constant refractive index. In the case of a prism, blue light travels slowest while red traverses the prism the fastest. This results in a spectrum. ",

            "answer_text": "Pure white light is seen when all the different colours (wavelength) of light overlap. Transparent objects have a property known as refractive index. This defines how optically \u201cthick\u201d the substance is. A high refractive index means that light gets slowed down more whilst passing through it. Tge refractive index can be dependant on the wavelength of then might passing through it meaning that red light is slowed down less than the blue light, if then light is hitting at an angle this causes the blue light to bend more than the red light. As white light is a continuous distribution of all the colours the refractive index causes them to diffract into a rainbow. ",
