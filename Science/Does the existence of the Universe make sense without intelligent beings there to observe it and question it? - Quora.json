            "answer_text": "The way I see it, why does it need to make sense? The universe is and therefore it exists. Or does it? What proof do we actually have? Look to the sky at night and supposedly you are staring out into the universe. Full of stars, other galaxies and other planets. What physical proof do we actually have though? You can\u2019t touch it. You can\u2019t go see anything out there for yourself. What if everything that you have been told is based on a giant misconception? I know there are observatories with massive telescopes that peer out into the darkness and let us see what may exist. How about a completely different perspective on intelligence and the universe? What if earth is like being in an aquarium? You can see out if you look but you can\u2019t reach any farther than your boundaries or limitations allow you to. We have been told about things like landing on the moon, the Mars Rovers and even the Galileo looking at Jupiter. Are any of those real? Yes? How do you know? Because you have been told? We are told that man is intelligent. If man is so intelligent then why do we have nothing but mass confusion everywhere we go? Man can\u2019t even duplicate one pyramid or even the Coral Castle in Florida. What if everything you think you know about life, our planet, the solar system and even the galaxie is just a dream? When you are having a dream do you know anything else about life? Do you question what\u2019s happening while you are there? It does sense at the time. Man is like a single leaf on a tree in the middle of the forest. Insignificant and part of a greater collective that one day will wither and die, like the leaf in fall. ",

We could use words like \u2018heaven\u2019 and \u2018god\u2019, but these often cause offence. Words often carry prejudices with them. I believe you exist and this question is both profound and intelligent. So, this universe is special because it contains intelligent life. Is there any need for other universes? Only if certain possibilites cannot happen here. I went to the trouble of designing experiments to show we needed to find a more general quantum physics which would allow more possibilites. After many years i discovered one using only water. There is no need for other universes, everything can happen here, eventually. Perhaps the sense is where intelligent sentient is going instead of the now. One thing life has definitely taught me is patience. Sense is tomorrow. ",

Let's suppose that we humans are the only inteligent forms of life in the universe (which I hope is not true). Before the humans evolved from to our elder relative with the chimps to who we are now, a moment in wich we weren't able to process a concept like existence; or even before there was any life on Earth, the universe was of course, still there. But still, many people have questioned the fact that things have actually happened beyond our measures of perception. There is a phrase that says: \u201cIf a tree falls down in the middle of a forest with no man to hear it brake and hit the ground, has it actually happened?\u201d So, to your question: yes, the existence of the universe makes sense even without anyone to perceive it but of course it is on you to take a position about it and think whatever you want, even something (in my opinion) as ridiculous as that our measures of perception set limits to that which happens in this universe.

Would the universe be explicable if there was no one to explain it nor anyone to understand the explanation? In the sense that there is no sense without human culture then the existence of the Universe would indeed make no sense without us. On the other hand if you are asking if the universe incorporates some intrinsic necessity to be understood then I\u2019d say that\u2019s a misguided question asking for a wild assed guess. Indeed, it is an invitation to an anthropocentric projection. If you happen to be enmeshed in some theological view that is legitimised by such a thing being true then you are likely to be misled into thinking it\u2019s a valid and pointed question. But it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s like asking if trees are envious of dancers. Anthropocentric bias is difficult to avoid and it\u2019s responsible for a shit-ton of profound absurdity. ",

One of the core principles of Quantum Physics is the idea that reality ( the photons that produce the light-illusion we all occupy ) exists in infinite possible states until we observe it and thus collapse all potential versions of reality into the one single option we\u2019ve chosen to live inside. It sounds radical, I know, but there\u2019s science to back it up. And the implications, once you truly start to consider them are limitless ",

Though we\u2019re very creative, the fact is the universe seems to have been running smoothly for most of its lifetime without humanity to motivate it by appreciatively observing, and in due course it's quite certain it will have to carry on without us. So yes, the universe would seem to make sense with or without us or any other intelligent observer, given that the elements necessary to build any intelligent beings had to be synthesized first, and that there is no evidence that the absence of the only intelligent observer we know anything about crippled it much.

The weak anthropomorphic principle itself also seems rather more profound than it really is: without the precursors necessary for any specific kind of thing to exist, there would be no such things.
