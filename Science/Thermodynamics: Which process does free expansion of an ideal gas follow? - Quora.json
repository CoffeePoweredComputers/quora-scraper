Three things must kept in mind initial temp = Final temp ( Most of the people are confused in this, they think it must be isothermal but this is not true. In isothermal process temp remain same during whole process but in the case of free expansion temp may increase or decrease in between bt remain constant at the end)PV (initial) = PV (final)Work done= 0",

            "answer_text": "In vacuum,there is no external pressure on the gas. Moreover, W=work done=(P)external*(change in volume). Hence, here the work done is zero. There are no constraints on internal energy change in the free expansion as above. dq=Tds. As the volume of gas increased, the entropy of the system increases. Thus, ds>0 implying dq>0, irrespective of value of T. Furthermore,du=dq (as W=0) implying du>0. Thus,we observe that internal energy increases in the free expansion, and consequently temperature too. Thus, free expansion is neither isothermal, nor adiabatic.Its only characteristic is that W=0. ",
