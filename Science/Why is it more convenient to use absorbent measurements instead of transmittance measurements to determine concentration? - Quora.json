            "answer_text": "If you want to count the number of fish in a bucket, what would you do? A: Put in a net and catch all the fish, then count the number of fish caught in the net? B: Dump the bucket in a lake, and count how many fish escape out of the bucket? A: is similar to measuring absorbance B: is similar to measuring transmittance. What if a fish decides to stay in the bucket, and not leave? What if a fish darts out, and you didn\u2019t see it quick enough to count it? None of these problems will crop up if you catch all the fish in a net, and make sure that there are none left in the bucket. Absorbance is much easier to measure accurately, whereas transmittance is subject to errors - how much incident light might have been scattered? Of the light that\u2019s been scattered, how much light could have been reflected into the detector somehow? All these sources of errors make transmittance measurement tricky. Absorbance measurement is direct, and directly correlated to the amount of absorbing substance present in the medium. It is also intuitively clear how absorbance depends on the analyte concentration. BTW, you HAVE to measure the amount of transmitted light that emerges from the analyte cell, in order to calculate the amount of light absorbed. Therefore, transmittance and absorbance are both measured when you do a spectrophotmetric measurement. ",

            "answer_text": "Why is it more convenient to use absorbent measurements instead of transmittance measurements to determine concentration? They measure the transmittance of the contents of a cell. However, they calculate absorbance/distance because this is linearly dependent on concentration. There is no similarly simple function that involves transmittance ",
