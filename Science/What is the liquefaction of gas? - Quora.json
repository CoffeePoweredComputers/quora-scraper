            "answer_text": "Hello Nilesh sir\u2026 Ohh.. you\u2019ve got Ph.D in Physics & Chemistry\u2026. Sir I\u2019m nothing in front of you to answer this\u2026 but i\u2019ll try. Asking in advance to forgive in any mistake. Ok\u2026 Lets start with what is gas & how it\u2019s different from vapors. Suppose we have a liquid provided with continuous heat transfer into it. When the liquid reaches saturation condition it began to change its phase by consuming the latent heat. Now we have the liquid in gaseous form just like saturated steam from water. Now getting those saturated vapors back into liquid phase, just take out the latent heat from vapors buy cooling it i.e, Condensation. Its quite easy. Now if we keep on heating the vessel containing these vapors its temperature and pressure goes on increasing. When the temperature and pressure of these vapors cross critical values then they can\u2019t be condensed simply by cooling\u2026 here they are known as gases. Just like air. Now to bringing back those gases back to liquid phase is called liquefaction. For doing this we\u2019ve to first bring back those gases below their critical T & P. Now just compressing those gases won\u2019t get us liquid\u2026it\u2019ll cause gas & liquid to co-exist in equilibrium. For liquefaction we have to compress as well as cool those gases. So, liquefaction of gases means converting those gases back to its liquid phase by simultaneously decreasing temperature and pressure and bringing them below their critical values upto a point where liquid form exists. \u2026\u2026 :) ",

            "answer_text": "Liquification of gases is the process by which substances in their gaseous state are converted into the liquid state. When a pressure on the gas is increased its molecules closer together , and temperature is reduced , which removes enough energy to make it change from the gaseous to the liquid state. ",
