            "answer_text": "A scientific purpose is contrary to a \"non-scientific\" purpose. Ideally, a scientific purpose is a set of studies which are done using the tools of science. Science can have many purposes. It can lead to technology and manufacturing of life saving drugs (my speciality). It can be about predicting earthquakes, or forecasting the weather. It can be studying humming birds to create new weapons. Science tries to be as objective as is possible. Objectivity requires One not have expectations as to what will (should?) be thefinal solution. Scientific research is most often not double blind research. There is always an intention for such purpose. So, when a scientific experiment is done, data are generated. This may be in the form of values, numbers, colors, hybrid animals. It is important to know that such data is neutral, and requires interpretation. Like the stars in the sky are interpreted as constelations. To create a firm constellation that everybody can see in the night and and everybody agrees that it is a Big Dipper. Typically a scientific purpose is to better understand a phenomenon through what is known as the Scientific Method. This Method works as follows Have an idea (hypothesis)Set up an experiment to test the ideaExcecute and gather data from the experimentAnalyze the data (modeling). See if data can be fit to the idea (model)Retest the experiment the hypothesis with experiments (reproducibility)Evaluate and change the hypothesis (unless you got lucky)Start at 2. againRepeatAs above, so below,RepeatThere is nothing special about science, we do it everyday. For example setting the water temperature in the shower or cooking to a recipe. We set up the stew and let it cool (experiment). We then then taste the stew (data collection and analysis). Then we decide the stew needs more salt (hypothesis), and so forth. Perhaps after 4\u20135 successful stew builds, we start to call our recipe a theory or a fact. Perhaps others try to repeat our stew recipe and they all agree; this makes the recipe a theory. A theory is not a fact, it's a theory. A theory is a concept which we create, a fact is hitting your thumb with a hammer (by mistake). Many think of theories as hardcore facts, but they are just ideas we agree on. Theories have been changing many times through the course of man's history, and will always continue. Today's science is tomorrow's mythology. ",
