            "answer_text": "First, it is always in shaky space; space is not the emptiness, space is full of debris quarks, neutrino e.t.c and other junk like dark energy waves, dark matter and something we did not discover yet. Second, electric and magnetic fields from nearby stuff. Third, temperature (as photon bombarding); if electron is leaving atom this will give mechanical push. Watch this \u2014 this is an analogy  Forth, something we are not sure yet. Electron spin is changing sometimes without the cause that we can see. ",

            "answer_text": "Temperature Let's just talk about kinetic energy and temperature. A definition for which we describe the root-mean-square (RMS) speed of an atom is by equating energy [math]\\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T[/math] So a particle with non-zero temperature (above absolute zero) is always said to be moving. How fast?  Consider an air molecule with a molecular weight of 28.97 g/mole [hint: convert to g/molecule]. If we use the above equation and solve for the speed, we would find v ~ 500 m/s. That's... pretty fast. I mean, it's nowhere near the speed of light, but certainly broke the sound barrier!  Now, take into account that molecules can bounce into each other and there is a mean free path (the length of which a single molecule can travel before collision with the atmospheric molecules) of 68 nm[ref]. This corresponds to about 150 picoseconds before a collision! If you think of this as frequency, that molecule of air is bouncing around with a frequency of 7.5 GHz! ",
