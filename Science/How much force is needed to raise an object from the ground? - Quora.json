            "answer_text": "In layman\u2019s terms, any force greater than the object\u2019s weight will lift it from the ground. More mathematically, to accelerate an object upward requires a force of F=ma, where m is the mass (in, say, kilograms), a is the gravity on the earth\u2019s surface (about 10 meters/second/second) and F is the force (in Newtons; a Newton is about 1/10 of a kilogram-force.) Not surprisingly, it takes a kilogram-force of force to lift a kilogram. In general, to lift an object from the surface of a spherical, uniformly dense planet, the force required is [math]F=G\\frac{M\\cdot m}{r^2}[/math] where: G is the Gravitational constant,m is the mass of the objectM is the mass of the planet,r is the radius of the planet.",

            "answer_text": "The force has to just slightly exceed the force of gravity. That force depends on the mass of the object. We know that [math]F = m \\times g [/math]. So take the mass of the object, multiply it by 9.8 meters per second per second (which is an average value for \u2018g\u2019 is at the surface of the earth) - if you give us the mass in kilograms - the resulting force is in Newtons. It\u2019s possible for some kinds of object to form an airtight seal against the ground - like maybe a giant suction cup\u2026or maybe what you\u2019d get if your car had sunk up to it\u2019s windows in mud. In that case, you might also need to overcome air pressure pushing down on it\u2026which makes the problem much harder to solve. ",
