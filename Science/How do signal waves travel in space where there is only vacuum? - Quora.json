            "answer_text": "Signal waves are nothing but the electromagnetic waves in digitalised system and they don't need any media. The speed of the waves is almost equal to the speed of light in vacuum. The difference is that the electro-magnetic waves from the Sun is a radiation containing charged particles whereas the signals are very low and controlled frequencies emmitted by electronic devices and gadgets and most sophisticated technology. For this purpose the communication satellites are used placing them at Convenient Synchronized Positions System to cover up 360 degrees circumference of the globe and keep the system operational round the clock throughout the year without interruptions. Except Solar Winds when increased, the Services are severly affected due to very intense and strong atomic particle stream coming out from the sun's corona. They encounter the planeteary magnetic fields and disrupt the telecommunication system of the Earth. Thanks ",
