            "answer_text": "A Theory of Anything is a model, and not the thing itself. We have a model for the Earth orbiting the sun, and we can discern celestial motion to confirm it\u2026 except, what we actually see are the heavens including the sun moving across our skies. Which is why Ptolemy\u2019s model was so popular for a millennium and a half. It correlated with observation. But we post-enlightenment types infer from all our other physical models that the Earth, in fact, orbits the sun. This is called Model-dependent realism. A deeper truth is that both of these ideas are correct. The Sun does orbit the Earth, it\u2019s just that the math is WAY more complex than Earth orbiting the sun. We like our models to be as simple as possible. In science, simplicity is called elegance. An elegant equation is a succinct one (you don\u2019t get any more succinct than E=mc^2). So a model is considered a good model if it is elegant; explains all existing observations; makes falsifiable predictions; and has few arbitrary adjustments. All good. Except that, sadly, we have no model that describes all parts of the universe in one Theory of Everything. We have overlapping theories where one model takes over from the last on a scalar boundary. So\u2026 if there is no Theory of Everything, what that really means is that our modelling\u2014which is great for glimpsing into the void\u2014cannot replicate the void. It means we lack the language to fully understand the universe. The best we can do is study the bits we can wrap our minds around and gape in awe at the rest. ",

            "answer_text": "The whole of science, whether or not intentionally, proceeds upon the presumption that there exist objective physical laws entailing a mutually compatible set of fundamental physical postulates, encapsulating the behaviour of the physical universe and everything in it. Evidently, such a theory does not entail a complete explanation or description of everything in existence, but presumably it does exhaustively describe all testable physical processes. As such, I would say that we presume that a theory of everything exists. The existence of such a framework does not however necessarily imply that it is comprehensible or that it will ever be discovered, if indeed it is not in principle indiscernible. Throughout history the function of science and proto-scientific thought has been to obtain evermore precise and accurate descriptions of the universe we observe. The question of \u201cthe theory of everything\u201d, in the sense I\u2019ve described above, is not typically considered a realistic aim of physicists. Rather, physicists may seek to discover novel conceptual frameworks wherein we might hope to understand evident points of conflict between disparate paradigms, such as the unification of quantum mechanics and gravitational physics that we have been searching for for much of the last century.
