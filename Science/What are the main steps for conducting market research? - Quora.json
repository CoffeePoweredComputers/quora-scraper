            "answer_text": "A good market research is the first step to any successful business or industry. However, to start the process, certain basic steps must be fulfilled. These may seem simple, but are the most critical. Here is a brief on basics of market research by understanding the basic elements of studying a business, brand, objective, and more. 1. What is the Problem? Knowing that the problem is will help you understand the approach of the research, and identifying what the management is finding difficult to deal with. Once the cause is diagnosed, you can develop the solutions. Then you can select the market research angle and examine the experiences of potential customers, repeat purchasers, or first-time users or the target audience. NOTE: Focus on action and configuration of research problem with clear objectives set ahead. 2. Which Inquiry Method to Choose? There are various patterns of investigation that provide an opportunity to utilize the existing knowledge or refer secondary resources to get the data. Some of the scientific techniques include: formulating the problem, developing a hypothesis, drawing predictions and devising a test, at last conducting the research and analyzing the results. The methods used could be objective or subjective as per requirements. NOTE: It is important to be impartial during analysis to get accurate outcome, emphasize on reality not personal judgment. 3. Which is Best Research Method? Research method is different from that needed for inquiry. It may be experimental or non-experimental. The former method gives you control over variables that you can manipulate and influence the process implemented. But, non-experimental approach allows no intervention but only observation. The market research design is also vital. It is the framework adapted for conducting the study or collecting data to acquire information needed. NOTE: Follow a research method and design, which arrives at solution in best possible time and encompasses all details needed to answer the questions. 4. What are the Data Collecting Techniques? To collect data, you may combine interviews and observation research or common communication modes such as the email, internet, telephone, face to face etc. The collection of data may have a broad category of skills involved, and analysis of both reviewing previous studies and published external sources, or more. How the results are recorded is closely linked to the collecting technique you use. NOTE: You may utilize more than one data collecting technique for better results. 5. What must be the Sample Design? Examining ideal audience being practical and requires choosing the best sample size. A smaller yet accurate representation of greater population will provide great output. Once relevant population is established you need to make inferences on larger population by probability or non-probability sampling. The fist method engages random sampling, and the second is based on judgment of investigators and employs focused sampling only. NOTE: Determining appropriate sample size will make you arrive at accurate decisions with less or no errors, keeping the market research cost down. 6. How to Analyze and Interpret? For making the data collecting useful, you have to properly interpret and analyze the same. There are several analytical software and tools today that offer good results, cutting down on manual ways of studying the information. The marketing research report must be effective and contain detailed findings, answers to the conflict, discussion by experts if needed, simple language used to the reading audience can understand, concise reporting, references included, alternative presentation, graphs & stats for enhancing output. NOTE: Prepare a summary report that can be referred by the clients to the technical or larger market research report. ",

            "answer_text": "Marketing research exercise may take many forms but systematic enquiry is a feature common to all such forms. Being a systematic enquiry, it requires a careful planning of the orderly investigation process. The various stages or steps in the marketing research process are discussed below: 1. Identification and Defining the Problem: The market research process begins with the identification of a problem faced by the company. 2. Statement of Research Objectives: After identifying and defining the problem with or without explanatory research, the researcher must take a formal statement of research objectives. Such objectives may be stated in qualitative or quantitative terms and expressed as research questions, statement or hypothesis. 3. Planning the Research Design or Designing the Research Study: After defining the research problem and deciding the objectives, the research design must be developed. A research design is a master plan specifying the procedure for collecting and analysing the needed information. It represents a framework for the research plan of action. 4. Planning the Sample: Sampling involves procedures that use a small number of items or parts of the \u2018population\u2019 (total items) to make conclusion regarding the \u2018population\u2019. 5. Data Collection: The collection of data relates to the gathering of facts to be used in solving the problem. Data can be Primary (analyzing current sales and the effectiveness of current practices or collecting new fresh data) or Secondary (analyze data that has already been published or present with company.) 6. Data Processing and Analysis: Analysis of data represents the application of logic to the understanding of data collected about the subject. 7. Formulating Conclusion, Preparing and Presenting the Report: The final stage in the marketing research process is that of interpreting the information and drawing conclusion for use in managerial decision. The management is not interested in details of research design and statistical analysis, They just want the concrete findings of the research. Researchers must make the presentation technically accurate, understandable and useful avoiding clutter of excel and data numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "The purpose of market research is to provide relevant data that will help solve marketing problems a business will encounter. This is absolutely necessary for the start-up phase. Conducting thorough market surveys is the foundation of any successful business. In fact, strategies such as market segmentation (identifying specific segments within a market) and product differentiation (creating an identity for your product or service that separates it from your competitors') would be impossible to develop without market research. Whether you're conducting market research using the historical, experimental, observational, or survey method, you'll be gathering two types of data. The first will be \"primary\" information that you will compile yourself or hire someone to gather. Most information, however, will be \"secondary,\" or already compiled and organized for you. Reports and studies were done by government agencies, trade associations, or other businesses within your industry are examples of the latter. Search for them, and take advantage of them. YouTube Launches YouTube Select for U.K. Brands and Advertisers Primary ResearchWhen conducting primary research using your own resources, there are basically two types of information that can be gathered: exploratory and specific. Exploratory research is open-ended in nature; helps you define a specific problem; and usually involves detailed, unstructured interviews in which lengthy answers are solicited from a small group of respondents. Specific research is broader in scope and is used to solve a problem that exploratory research has identified. Interviews are structured and formal in approach. Of the two, specific research is more expensive. When conducting primary research using your own resources, you must first decide how you will question your target group of individuals. There are basically three avenues you can take: direct mail, telemarketing, or personal interviews. Direct MailIf you choose a direct-mail questionnaire, be sure to do the following in order to increase your response rate: Make sure your questions are short and to the point.Make sure questionnaires are addressed to specific individuals and they're of interest to the respondent.Limit the questionnaire's length to two pages.Enclose a professionally prepared cover letter that adequately explains what you need.Send a reminder about two weeks after the initial mailing. Include a postage-paid self-addressed envelope.Unfortunately, even if you employ the above tactics, response to direct mail is always low and is sometimes less than five percent. Google Announces Google Workspace; Gives Gmail a New Look - martechlive Phone SurveysPhone surveys are generally the most cost-effective, considering overall response rates; they cost about one-third as much as personal interviews, which have, on average, a response rate which is only 10 percent. Following are some phone survey guidelines: At the beginning of the conversation, your interviewer should confirm the name of the respondent if calling home, or give the appropriate name to the switchboard operator if calling a business.Pauses should be avoided, as respondent interest can quickly drop.Make sure that a follow-up call is possible if additional information is required.Make sure that interviewers don't divulge details about the poll until the respondent is reached.As mentioned phone interviews are cost-effective but speed is another big advantage. Some of the more experienced interviewers can get through up to 10 interviewers an hour (however, speed for speed's sake is not the goal of any of these surveys), but five to six per hour is more typical. Phone interviews also allow you to cover a wide geographical range relatively inexpensively. Phone costs can be reduced by taking advantage of cheaper rates during certain hours. Google Brings in New Ad Buying Tools to Simplify Campaigns Personal InterviewsThere are two main types of personal interviews: The group survey. Used mostly by big business, group interviews can be useful as brainstorming tools resulting in product modifications and new product ideas. They also give you insight into buying preferences and purchasing decisions among certain populations.The depth interview. One-on-one interviews where the interviewer is guided by a small checklist and basic common sense. Depth interviews are either focused or non-directive. Non-directive interviews encourage respondents to address certain topics with minimal questioning. The respondent, in essence, leads the interview. The focused interview, on the other hand, is based on a pre-set checklist. The choice and timing of questions, however, are left to the interviewer, depending on how the interview goes.When considering which type of survey to use, keep the following cost factors in mind: Mail. Most of the costs here concern the printing of questionnaires, envelopes, postage, the cover letter, time taken in the analysis and presentation, the cost of researcher time, and any incentives used.Telephone. The main costs here are the interviewer's fee, phone charges, preparation of the questionnaire, cost of researcher time, and the analysis and presentation of the results of the questioning.Personal interviews. Costs include the printing of questionnaires and prompt cards if needed, the incentives used, the interviewer's fee and expenses, the cost of researcher time, and analysis and presentation.Group discussions. Your main costs here are the interviewer's fees and expenses in recruiting and assembling the groups, renting the conference room or other facility, researcher time, any incentives used, analysis and presentation, and the cost of recording media such as tapes if any are used.TikTok Records Massive Growth in Europe During the COVID-19 Pandemic - martechlive Secondary Research Secondary data is outside information assembled by government agencies, industry and trade associations, labor unions, media sources, chambers of commerce, etc., and found in the form of pamphlets, newsletters, trade, and other magazines, newspapers, and so on. It's termed secondary data because the information has been gathered by another, or secondary, source. The benefits of this are obvious--time and money are saved because you don't have to develop survey methods or do the interviewing. Secondary sources are divided into three main categories: Public. Public sources are the most economical, as they're usually free, and can offer a lot of good information. These sources are most typically governmental departments, business departments of public libraries, etc.Commercial. Commercial sources are equally valuable, but usually involve costs such as subscription and association fees. However, you spend far less than you would if you hired a research team to collect the data firsthand. Commercial sources typically consist of research and trade associations, organizations like SCORE (Society Corps of Retired Executives) and Dun & Bradstreet, banks and other financial institutions, publicly-traded corporations, etc.Educational. Educational institutions are frequently overlooked as viable information sources, yet there is more research conducted in colleges, universities, and polytechnic institutes than virtually any sector of the business community.Government statistics is among the most plentiful and wide-ranging public sources of information. Start with the Census Bureau's helpful Hidden Treasures--Census Bureau Data and Where to Find It! In seconds, you'll find out where to find federal and state information. Other government publications that are helpful include: Statistical and Metropolitan Area Data Book. Offers statistics for metropolitan areas, central cities, and counties.Statistical Abstract of the United States. Data books with statistics from numerous sources, government to private.U.S. Global Outlook. Traces the growth of 200 industries and gives five-year forecasts for each.Choosing the Right Agile Marketing FrameworkDon't neglect to contact specific government agencies such as the Small Business Administration (SBA). They sponsor several helpful programs such as SCORE and Small Business Development Centers (SBDCs) which can provide you with free counseling and a wealth of business information. The Department of Commerce not only publishes helpful books like the U.S. Global Outlook, but it also produces an array of products with information regarding both domestic industries and foreign markets through its International Trade Administration (ITA) branch. The above items are available from the U.S. Government Printing Office. One of the best public sources is the business section of public libraries. The services provided vary from city to city, but usually include a wide range of government and market statistics, a large collection of directories including information on domestic and foreign businesses, as well as a wide selection of magazines, newspapers, and newsletters. Almost every county government publishes population density and distribution figures in accessible census tracts. These tracts will show you the number of people living in specific areas, such as precincts, water districts, or even 10-block neighborhoods. Other public sources include city chambers of commerce or business development departments, which encourage new businesses in their communities. They will supply you (usually for free) with information on population trends, community income characteristics, payrolls, industrial development, and so on. Among the best commercial sources of information are research and trade associations. Information gathered by trade associations is usually confined to a certain industry and available only to association members, with a membership fee frequently required. However, the research gathered by the larger associations is usually thorough, accurate, and worth the cost of membership. Two excellent resources to help you locate a trade association that reports on the business you're researching are Encyclopedia of Associations (Gale Research) and Business Information Sources (University of California Press) and can usually be found at your local library. Research associations are often independent but are sometimes affiliated with trade associations. They often limit their activities to conducting and applying research in industrial development, but some have become full-service information sources with a wide range of supplementary publications such as directories. Educational institutions are very good sources of research. Research there ranges from faculty-based projects often published under professors' bylines to student projects, theses, and assignments. Copies of student research projects may be available for free with faculty permission. Consulting services are available either for free or at a cost negotiated with the appropriate faculty members. This can be an excellent way to generate research at little or no cost, using students who welcome the professional experience either as interns or for special credit. Contact the university administration departments and marketing/management studies departments for further information. University libraries are additional sources of research. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is vague.  \"Important\" to the reader or the writer of the research paper?  Anyone who writes research papers must read research papers (lots of them), and  professional scholars and researchers do so habitually. But large numbers of other people who never write research papers may read at least some of them. The question could also go to the professor whose students write research papers: what is important for him? So the question can be read several ways. But I want to seize on one thing as someone who writes papers and who works with students and colleagues who are also writing papers.  For a research study to result in a paper it must be both comprehensible and feasible.  That is, as a writer and researcher you should be able to present your problem in a way readers can grasp.  Before taking on a project you need to know that you can do the study, that you will be able to account for all the elements, that you will be able to assimilate what is already known about your topic, and that you will be able to answer the \"question\" you have asked. Now there isn't always a single question that can be summed up in a single sentence ending in a question mark. It's not as simple as that. But whatever it is one wants to establish, one needs to be sure one can do it without leaving major aspects of the problem unsettled by the time one is done with the project. The reader of the research paper only sees the end product, not the work that goes into it, so for him, feasibility is not a problem while comprehensibility remains very important in evaluating the paper. As a reader one should be able to discern what the point of the paper is without having to read all of it to see what it's about.  Only then can one determine whether the author has answered his question (or questions).   So that's the final \"important thing\": the weight of evidence establishing that the author has answered his own question or questions. ",

Defining the Problem or Opportunity Develop questions that will allow you to define your problem (or opportunity), and examine all potential causes so that the research can be whittled down to the information you actually need to solve that problem or determine what action to take regarding an opportunity. 2. Developing Your Marketing Research Plan Interview prospects and customers; conduct a survey; run user tests on your website or landing page(s). 3. Collect Relevant Data and Information In marketing research, most of the data you collect will be quantitative (numbers or data) versus qualitative, which is descriptive and observational. Ideally, you will gather a mix of the two types of data. 4. Analyze Data and Report Findings It\u2019s important to look for trends as opposed to specific pieces of information. As you\u2019re analyzing your data, don\u2019t try to find patterns based on your assumptions prior to collecting the data. 5.

            "answer_text": "Stage 1: Formulating the Marketing Research Problem Formulating a problem is the first step in the research process. In many ways, research starts with a problem that management is facing. This problem needs to be understood, the cause diagnosed, and solutions developed. However, most management problems are not always easy to research. A management problem must first be translated into a research problem. Once you approach the problem from a research angle, you can find a solution. For example, \u201csales are not growing\u201d is a management problem. Translated into a research problem, we may examine the expectations and experiences of several groups: potential customers, first-time buyers, and repeat purchasers. We will determine if the lack of sales is due to: Poor expectations that lead to a general lack of desire to buy, orPoor performance experience and a lack of desire to repurchase.What then is the difference between a management problem and a research problem? Management problems focus on an action. Do we advertise more? Do we change our advertising message? Do we change an under-performing product configuration? If so, how? Research problems, on the other hand, focus on providing the information you need in order to solve the management problem. Stage 2: Method of Inquiry The scientific method is the standard pattern for investigation. It provides an opportunity for you to use existing knowledge as a starting point and proceed impartially. The scientific method includes the following steps: Formulate a problemDevelop a hypothesisMake predictions based on the hypothesisDevise a test of the hypothesisConduct the testAnalyze the resultsThe terminology is similar to the stages in the research process. However, there are subtle differences in the way the steps are performed. For example, the scientific method is objective while the research process can be subjective. Objective-based research (quantitative research) relies on impartial analysis. The facts are the priority in objective research. On the other hand, subjective-based research (qualitative research) emphasizes personal judgment as you collect and analyze data. Stage 3: Research Method In addition to selecting a method of inquiry (objective or subjective), you must select a research method. There are two primary methodologies that can be used to answer any research question: experimental research and non-experimental research. Experimental research gives you the advantage of controlling extraneous variables and manipulating one or more variables that influences the process being implemented. Non-experimental research allows observation but not intervention. You simply observe and report on your findings. Stage 4: Research Design The research design is a plan or framework for conducting the study and collecting data. It is defined as the specific methods and procedures you use to acquire the information you need. Stage 5: Data Collection Techniques Your research design will develop as you select techniques to use. There are many ways to collect data. Two important methods to consider are interviews and observation.Interviews require you to ask questions and receive responses. Common modes of research communication include interviews conducted face-to-face, by mail, by telephone, by email, or over the Internet. This broad category of research techniques is known as survey research. These techniques are used in both non-experimental research and experimental research. Another way to collect data is by observation. Observing a person\u2019s or company\u2019s past or present behavior can predict future purchasing decisions. Data collection techniques for past behavior can include analyzing company records and reviewing studies published by external sources. In order to analyze information from interview or observation techniques, you must record your results. Because the recorded results are vital, measurement and development are closely linked to which data collection techniques you decide on. The way you record the data changes depends on which method you use. Stage 6: Sample Design Your marketing researchproject will rarely examine an entire population. It\u2019s more practical to use a sample\u2014a smaller but accurate representation of the greater population. In order to design your sample, you must find answers to these questions: From which base population is the sample to be selected?What is the method (process) for sample selection?What is the size of the sample?Once you\u2019ve established who the relevant population is (completed in the problem formulation stage), you have a base for your sample. This will allow you to make inferences about a larger population. There are two methods of selecting a sample from a population: probability or non-probability sampling. The probability method relies on a random sampling of everyone within the larger population. Non- probability is based in part on the judgment of the investigator, and often employs convenience samples, or by other sampling methods that do not rely on probability. The final stage of the sample design involves determining the appropriate sample size. This important step involves cost and accuracy decisions. Larger samples generally reduce sampling error and increase accuracy, but also increase costs. Stage 7: Data Collection Once you\u2019ve established the first six stages, you can move on to data collection. Depending on the mode of data collection, this part of the process can require large amounts of personnel and a significant portion of your budget. Personal (face-to-face) and telephone interviews may require you to use a data collection agency (field service). Internet surveys require fewer personnel, are lower cost, and can be completed in days rather than weeks or months. Regardless of the mode of data collection, the data collection process introduces another essential element to your research project: the importance of clear and constant communication. Stage 8: Analysis and Interpretation In order for data to be useful, you must analyze it. Analysis techniques vary and their effectiveness depends on the types of information you are collecting, and the type of measurements you are using. Because they are dependent on the data collection, analysis techniques should be decided before this step. Stage 9: The Marketing Research Report The marketing research process culminates with the research report. This report will include all of your information, including an accurate description of your research process, the results, conclusions, and recommended courses of action. The report should provide all the information the decision maker needs to understand the project. It should also be written in language that is easy to understand. It\u2019s important to find a balance between completeness and conciseness. You don\u2019t want to leave any information out; however, you can\u2019t let the information get so technical that it overwhelms the reading audience. One approach to resolving this conflict is to prepare two reports: the technical report and the summary report. The technical report discusses the methods and the underlying assumptions. In this document, you discuss the detailed findings of the research project. The summary report, as its name implies, summarizes the research process and presents the findings and conclusions as simply as possible. Another way to keep your findings clear is to prepare several different representations of your findings. PowerPoint presentations, graphs, and face-to-face reports are all common methods for presenting your information. Along with the written report for reference, these alternative presentations will allow the decision maker to understand all aspects of the project. Resource Planning for Your Study As you are developing your study, you have to account for the expenditure of your resources: personnel, time, and money. Resource plans need to be worked out with the decision maker and will range from very formal budgeting and approval processes to a very informal \u201cGo ahead and do it\u201d. Before you can start the research project, you should get yourself organized and prepare a budget and time schedule for the major activities in the study. Microsoft Project and similar programs are good resources for breaking down your tasks and resources. ",

There are no hard and fast rules in terms of steps to take or order in general. That is because each business and vertical has its own unique set of needs. However, you can take the following route to perform an effective market research campaign: Begin at a high level, by studying your industry at large. This involves using secondary research (research already collected, processed and made available).Look into the latest trends within your own niche from credible sources such as Google Alerts, Google Trends, MarketResearch.com, Keyhole and others.Find what consumers are searching for in your market with SEO platforms like Google Keyword Planner, SEMrush and many others.Dig even deeper on the latest trends, news and occurrences in your niche via industry blogs, news, videos and search terms for free (Google Alerts).Identify your direct and indirect competitors: Direct competitors are Businesses with products/services that closely resemble your own and can substitute yours. Indirect competitors are businesses with relatively similar products/services, but cannot fully substitute yours.Study your competitors closely by visiting their websites, social media and by viewing their internet ads, such as the ones you see in the SERP.Find the potential weaknesses in your competitors\u2019 products/services, or learn how to use their strengths to improve your own.Continue using SEMrush and other similar websites (Moz), as they provide competitor performance reports.Next, gather all the necessary secondary research on the typical personas within the market. Keep an eye on their buying habits, conversion rates and other characteristics.The Census Bureau and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (public market data)along with research agencies (Ex: Pew, Forrester and Gartner) can help with this.Next, we move on to primary research (research you must amass on your own). Run primary research on your target market by conducting:open-ended interviews over the phone or in-personsurveys with a small number of respondentssurveys that cover the entirety of your target marketCreate surveys that focus on specific segments of your target market. Focus on questions aimed at solving points of friction or problems.Finally, store all the findings on your market (the specific niche, competitors and your target market) into an organized and comprehensive document such as a presentation for current and ongoing reference. This is going to be your market knowledge base.There\u2019s always going to be more you can do to obtain market research.

In General, it is conducted via Survey forms that is through Questionnaires which contains set of questions that you wanted ask and analyse. This happens in the similar way both from companies and people. While going to companies, you must have certain data like whom to contact in the company, their contact details or Linkedin profiles etc so that you can approach them with your queries. Often, you should always remember to connect to right people while gathering the data which is actually helpful. If not, you will end up gathering data which is irrelevant sometimes. Having said, Connecting right people is important, you should also be punctual to collect data at right time from them. You can also send the questionnaires in google survey form to the people via Linkedin or Email so that it saves your time and effort. Hope this is helpful:) ",
