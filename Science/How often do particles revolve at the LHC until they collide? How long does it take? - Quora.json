            "answer_text": "From the topics you attached to the question I understand, that you are asking about the LHC. A beam proton makes one full revolution along the LHC in about 90 microseconds - so about 11000 revolutions per second. A typical fill in the LHC lasts maybe 10\u201315 hours, so a proton that has survived until end of fill must have circled the LHC about half a billion times. No, they don\u2019t create any vortex. The protons travel the LHC as a beam of about a mm transverse size. At the collision points the beams are magnetically squeezed to much smaller transverse size, to increase the collision probability. In the direction along the beam protons are travelling in packets called bunches - the length of a bunch is below 1 m. ",

            "answer_text": "There are three main phases of the LHC operation: injection, acceleration and (fine) tuning. At injection (from the SPS accelerator) protons have 450 GeV energy from which they are accelerated to 6500 GeV. Tuning is a process of ajusting the beam parameters to make them optimal for the collisions (orbit position and bunch sizes). All this takes some time of the order of 1 hour, Once the beams are ready beams are steered for collisions at the interaction points and experiments start running which can be as long as 10\u201320 hours. When the beams become of poor quality (due to intensity losses) they are dumped and a new cycle of the LHC operation restarts.  ",
