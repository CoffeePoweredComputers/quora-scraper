            "answer_text": "Hydrogen bonds are the main force keeping water molecules together as a liquid. If the hydrogen bonds in liquid water magically go poof, the water will rapidly vaporise in a giant cloud of steam. If all Hydrogen bonding in all water suddenly ceased to exists, the oceans would boil off into water vapour at a ridiculously fast rate. If the sudden influx of water vapour did not suffocate us, the greenhouse effect would be cranked into maximum overdrive. The earth would heat up extremely rapidly and cook every single living organism on earth. ",

            "answer_text": "Hydrogen bonding is a type of intermolecular force which holds the water molecule together. If there is no hydrogen bonding, then the melting point and boiling point would decrease dramatically. This is because less intermolecular force is needed to be overcomed. ",
