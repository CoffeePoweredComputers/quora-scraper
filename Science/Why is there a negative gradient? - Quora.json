            "answer_text": "I think you are talking about gradient descent. The direction of gradient is the direction in which the function increases at the highest rate, and the direction of negative gradient as expected is the one which causes the most rapid decline in the function value. In machine learning, we are most often concerned with minimizing functions such as objective values of optimization problems, and hence we resort to moving in the direction of the negative gradient.
