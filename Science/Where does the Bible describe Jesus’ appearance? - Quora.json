Revelation 1:14-15 Jesus's skin was a darker hue and that his hair was woolly in texture. The hairs of his head, it says, \"were white as white wool, white as snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace.\u201d What you see in movies & TV shows is their vision of Jesus & how he looked. That\u2019s phony & fake & isn\u2019t backed up by scripture. Nothing but hearsay, rumor\u2019s & gossip so take it with a grain of salt. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible does not describe the historical Jesus\u2019 appearance. There are a couple passages in Revelation describing the appearance of Jesus, but those descriptions are heavily symbolic and reflect what the author saw in a mystical vision sixty years after the crucifixion, and not what the historical Jesus actually looked like. Otherwise, the passage in Revelation is often misrepresented: it says nothing about the texture of his hair (only the color), and burnished bronze is a golden metallic color, not brown or black. The same passage says that he had a sword sticking out of his mouth and seven stars in his hand, and the same book also describes him in the form of a slain sheep. ",
