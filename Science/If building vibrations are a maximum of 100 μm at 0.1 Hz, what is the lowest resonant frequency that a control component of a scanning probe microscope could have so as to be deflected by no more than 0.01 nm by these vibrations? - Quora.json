            "answer_text": "Back-of-the-envelope calculations, with a bit of explanation\u2026 If one admits second order \u201cband-pass\u201d resonance, then the lateral slope of the resonance peak is 20 dB/decade. It is also assumed a gain equal to 1 (that is 0 dB) at the center/resonance frequency. Comparing the excitation with the tolerated deflection gives  dB as the attenuation that the \u201ctransfer function\u201d of the resonant peak must provide at 0.1 Hz. So, since the slope is 20 dB/decade, the resonance peak must be located at least 7 decades above 0.1 Hz, which is 1 MHz. HTH ",
