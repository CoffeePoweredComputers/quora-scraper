They exist only within a visual system (such as humans) that are capable of converting electro-magnetic signals into the visual sensation of color. As long as there has been \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018objects\u2019, the distribution of the wavelengths of incident light on the objects has been altered by this interaction, but there was no \u2018color\u2019 because there were no \u2018observers\u2019 who had the visual systems that could convert these altered wavelengths into the visual sensation of color in their brains.
