            "answer_text": "Not in general. An electrical gradient can create a concentration gradient* if ions and counterions are allowed to migrate. The concentration gradient will cause diffusion of the charges that will oppose the electrical gradient. At some time* after turning on the electrical field an equilibrium between concentration and electrical gradients will establish itself. This is assuming that the ions will not react with the sources of the electrical gradient, eg. metal electrodes. There\u2019s no special property of which I am aware that allows a molecule or ion to \u2018recognize\u2019 others, although high concentrations of an ion will create an electrical field among the ions that adds/subtracts from an external electric field. * - edited in revision.
