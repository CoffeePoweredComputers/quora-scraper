            "answer_text": "Such anemic answers. Doubts were raised about BB from the very beginning because it sounded too much like religion. To wit: Sir Fred Hoyle, British astronomer: \u201cThe passionate frenzy with which the Big Bang cosmology is clutched to the corporate scientific bosom evidently arises from a deep-rooted attachment to the first page of Genesis, religious fundamentalism at its strongest.\u201d William Bonner, British physicist: \u201cThe underlying motive is, of course, to bring in God as creator. It seems like the opportunity Christian theology has been waiting for ever since science began to depose religion from the minds of rational men in the 17th Century.\u201d Einstein rejected it initially because he couldn\u2019t let go of the Newtonian concept of an eternal universe, saying \u201cVos calculs sont correct, mais votre physique est abominable!\u201d That is, speaking to Georges Lemaitre, the Belgian physicist/priest who proposed BB in the first place based solely upon the math of the GTR, \u201cYour math is correct, but your physics is terrible!\u201d Einstein later had to back down completely when Hubble\u2019s observations in 1927\u201329 validated Lemaitre. Of course, religious folks, having grown accustomed to being suspicious of science, rejected BB because it didn\u2019t fit their own paradigm of a 6000-year-old creation story. These days, it is rejected because when you combine BB with fine-tuning, an observer-dependent universe, a very low entropy early universe, and a universe defined completely by interactions, it begins again to sound very much like something God would have done. So the Multiverse has become quite popular as an alternative with multiple Big Bangs and an infinite number of entirely undetectable universes, that is, absent any evidence whatsoever or any hope of ever finding any. However, what we have evidence for is a singular Big Bang and a unique universe. There is no evidence for any other alternative. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Why are doubts being raised about the Big Bang and the origin of the universe? A: There are three possible reasons. The first reason is religion. Some people are trained since childhood to a world-view which to a lesser or greater degree contradicts Big Bang cosmology. Thus they don\u2019t accept Big Bang cosmology.The second reason is ignorance. These people have a fleeting understanding of Big Bang cosmology and often a completely wrong understanding, which they find unbelievable. A big culprit here is the name \u201cBig Bang\u201d which is quite misleading. These people don\u2019t accept Big Bang cosmology, but when they argue against it, they argue against a strawman that their lack of knowledge has produced.The third reason is scepticism. There are a lot of unanswered questions in Big Bang cosmology, for instance what happened at the earliest moments after the Bang, or the lack of explanation of what caused inflation. That we don\u2019t know what dark matter and dark energy is doesn\u2019t help either. For that reason, some people are trying to find a new cosmology that they think better explains the observed evidence.",
