This is so true about birth control. Having seen firsthand, a number of women hurt by birth control, knowing my son\u2019s friend at 27 had to have stents in her coronary arteries, and noticing how many lawsuits there are against manufacturers, it is worrisome that women are not given full information.

            "answer_text": "It is easy to imagine what life would be without research: during the first million years, humanity barely survived and struggled against nature. When humans learnt through a primitive form of research how to use fire, the beginning of civilization started. And since the bronze age until less than two hundred years ago, humanity was almost exclusively an agricultural civilization. All started changing after the industrial revolution because of the research strategy we call scientific method. So, basically everything you enjoy today is, in one way or another, the result of research. ",
