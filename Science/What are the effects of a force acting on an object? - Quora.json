            "answer_text": "A (net) force causes a body to accelerate - always. With the exception of gravity, a force will also change the shape of a body - cause elastic and maybe plastic deformation of the body. This means it may change shape and go back when the force ceases to act or it may remain in the changed shape or some combination of the two. Gravity is different because in a uniform gravitational field eg near the earth, the gravitational force acts on every particle (proton, neutron and electron) of the object. So the force does not change the shape of the body. With other forces eg a rocket engine at the back of a spacecraft, the engine pushes the back spacecraft which in turn has to push the bit in front of it. This means that bit of the spacecraft is being compressed and its shape will change ( hopefully by a very tiny amount). Near a black hole/ neutron star, the gravitational field at one end of the object can be very different from the field at the other. This means that different ends of the object experience different forces- this will change the shape of the object. But this is an extreme case. ",

            "answer_text": "When a force acts on a object the object must not maybe but must have acceleration. So the object will either slow down or speed up or change directions and keep the same speed but the object will and must go through acceleration if a force is applied since F=MA. Since force dosent equal 0 and the object has mass there must be acceleration. ",

            "answer_text": "Force acting on an object may cause the object to change shape, to start moving, to stop moving, to accelerate or decelerate. When two objects interact with each other they exert a force on each other, the forces are equal in size but opposite in direction.(Newton's third law of motion) ",

Y=stress/strain Y=FL/Al The effect of any body can be estimated by stress vs strain graph of a respective object. The main effects are 1)elongation 2)compression 3)permanent deformation 4)break down.

Force can change the shape & size of the body. ",
