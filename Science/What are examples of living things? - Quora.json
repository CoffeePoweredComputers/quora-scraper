            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019m no biologist, but the question (in broader terms) is not that easy to answer. I mean I\u2019d like to delve into it a bit deeper than answering \u201ca potato\u201d etc like others have done (no offence meant ;-). The problem is that in evolution, there are no strict boundaries; not as such. As life evolved from \u201cnon-living\u201d or \u201cinorganic\u201d molecules AFAIK, the binary classification of living/non-living is faulty in principle. It\u2019s actually the same question as when exactly was the 1st bird hatched from an egg of a lizard? The answer is: there was no such event. Lizards produced lizards. Those lizards were very slightly different each generation, but each child was pretty much the same as their parents. It was only after quite some time when they become so different to their grand ancestors that we stop calling them lizards and start to call them birds. Because they could fly, had feather and so on. But there was never a clear barrier which would mark the \u201cbeginning of birds\u201d. What came first, a chicken or an egg? Neither came first. The distinction of life itself contains the same problem. Way back, there were just simple inorganic molecules. Again, I\u2019m no biologist, but AFAIK due certain natural processes (under the sea, probably close to volcanic activity, hot water containing sulphur and whatnot), more complex molecules emerged, which we call organic. These had combined into yet more complex molecules, eventually producing lipids, amino acids, proteins, RNA, DNA etc. Is that already life? Maybe not. But more complex organic structures emerged. Perhaps protocells or viruses. Is a virus alive? That\u2019s already much closer to our \u201cdefinition\u201d, although perhaps not fitting completely\u2026 We humans tend to enforce categories on everything we observe. With evolution, that\u2019s problematic, for the reasons above. We want clear borders and boundaries, but the nature doesn\u2019t oblige. So that\u2019s why the question is fundamentally difficult to answer; our model simply doesn\u2019t fit the reality (in finer distinctions). ",

            "answer_text": "Animals and plants. Donald Trump is said to be alive, and that this is proven by his mentioning of the size of his penis in public. Dead people, rocks, and pools of water never talk about their genitals, though robots could be programmed to do so, but why? Perhaps someone can make a TV show where fat extroverts with tattoos make, set or sell robots that talk voluminously about the quality and size of their genitals. Are viruses alive? They self-replicate, but I am never sure and my knowledge of biology is sadly lacking. Are you a living thing? Who knows.... ",
