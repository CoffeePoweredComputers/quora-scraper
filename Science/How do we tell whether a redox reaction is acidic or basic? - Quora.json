            "answer_text": "Redox is an oxidation - reduction reaction, where both of them are taking place. From reaction mechanism, you can tell whether \u201cthe reaction is taking place in a acidic or basic medium\u201d ( if H+ is present during balancing the reaction then it's acidic medium, and if OH- is present then it's basic medium). But as per my knowledge, you can't say whether \u201cthe reaction is acidic or basic.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "If you have a balanced equation and you see hydrogen ions, hydronium ions or the formulas of acids, then it is taking place in acidic medium. If you see hydroxide ions or the formulas of bases , then it\u2019s probably taking place in basic medium. If you\u2019re performing the reaction, you\u2019ll know because you added an acid or a base. If it\u2019s a \u201cbalance this redox equation\u201d problem from your teacher, the information is usually given in the problem. ",
