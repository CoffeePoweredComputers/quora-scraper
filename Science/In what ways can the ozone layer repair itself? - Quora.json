            "answer_text": "Ozone forms naturally in the stratosphere. Ozone is primarily created when ultraviolet light hits an oxygen molecule (O2). The energy in the light breaks the molecule into two oxygen atoms (O + O). Since atomic oxygen is highly reactive, when one of them encounters an oxygen molecule (O2), the oxygen atom (O) will bond to it forming ozone (O3). Additionally, there are natural processes that destroy ozone. For example, when blue or ultraviolet light hits an ozone molecule (O3), it can break it into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom (O2 + O). Ozone can also be destroyed when an ozone molecule (O3) encounters an oxygen atom (O), the atomic oxygen will react with ozone molecule breaking it apart. The resulting oxygen molecule and two oxygen atoms will recombine forming two oxygen molecules (O2 + O2). The amount of ozone in the stratosphere is, therefore, an equilibrium between the ozone production processes and ozone destruction processes. The recent reduction in the concentration of stratospheric ozone occurred due to the introduction of ozone-destroying anthropogenic chemicals, i.e., chemicals produced by human activity. Anthropogenic chemicals that destroy ozone include compounds that contain chlorine, bromine, nitrogen, and/or hydrogen. The addition of these chemicals to the stratosphere increases the rate of ozone destruction, shifting the equilibrium point, depressing the concentration of stratospheric ozone. Thus, the ozone layer can be repaired by reducing the concentration of anthropogenic chemicals reaching the stratosphere. In the last two decades, there has been a global effort to reduce the release of ozone-destroying chemicals, such as long-lived CFCs, into the atmosphere.

            "answer_text": "Indeed. Two latest reports are noteworthy in this regard. MIT Study In a study published in Science, Scientists at MIT have identified the \u201cfirst fingerprints of healing\u201d of the Antarctic ozone layer. MIT team found that the September ozone hole has shrunk by more than 4 million square kilometers \u2014 larger than the area of INDIA \u2014 since 2000, when ozone depletion was at its peak. The team also showed for the first time that this recovery has slowed somewhat at times, due to the effects of volcanic eruptions from year to year. Overall, however, the ozone hole appears to be on a healing path. Scientists observe first signs of healing in the Antarctic ozone layer NASA observations A good news! NASA has revealed that the ozone hole should be \u2018half closed\u2019 in the next five years. NASA by the virtue of observations made using its new ozone layer monitoring system SAGE III have showed that it had been recovering for the past 18 years. In a Nasa interview about SAGE III posted online, Joe Zawodny, Nasa project scientist at the Langley Research Center, in Hampton, Virginia, USA, said: \"We should have recovered roughly half of the ozone that we lost from 1980 to 1997. Ozone recovery shock: Nasa says hole in Ozone Layer should be 'half closed in 5 years' Here\u2019s a image from 1998:  Here\u2019s one revealed by NASA in 2013:  It has not vanished miraculously but have shown signals of recovery. The complete healing is likely to take another few decades,if everything goes as per the plan. However, I must say Montreal have achieved what it desired, better than many other initiatives out there. ",
