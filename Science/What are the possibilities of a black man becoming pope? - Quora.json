            "answer_text": "There were three popes from Africa the fourteenth popr Victor I (189\u2013198AD)the 32nd Pope Miltiades (311\u2013318 ad)the 49tj Gelasius (492\u2013496)They were most likely black skinned like the vast majority of North Africans of that time. They are hardly talked about because they were not white men and they are of African origin. African Popes are hardly mentioned. The same goes for the hundreds of African saints from the early Christian Church in North Africa. I still wonder why there is little mention of the first black saints from North Africa who became the black icons venerated by Orthodox Christians. The Patron Saint of the Holy Roman Empire was a black man from Egypt, North Africa. He is the most celebrated saint. He is Saint Maurice, the Theban. He achieved sainthood along with the members of the Theban Legion he commanded. Another member of the Theban Legion is Sait Gereon, the Patron Saint of Cologne in Germany.

Cardinal Peter Turkson is well respected, and could be papabile after Francis or his successor. But i suspect it will not happen in the next conclave. I do suspect it will happen within the lifetime of many of us now living. ",
