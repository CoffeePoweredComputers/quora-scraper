            "answer_text": "Question: What are the disadvantages of pneumatic systems? One disadvantage that I have discovered is that many locations that use it, have a problem with keeping qualified compressor mechanics on staff, and thus have to call in expensive outside technicians and contractors to repair even minor issues. Compressors, while not normally difficult technically, often are proprietary in their function and parts. While there are numerous interchangeable valves and seals for hydraulics systems, many compressors require THEIR manufacturers equipment and training in their repair methods. Once a mechanic or technician has received that and becomes competent, then the low wages that they are receiving from your firm may not be enough to keep them on staff. I have worked at myriad places who lost a good mechanic when he/she found out that they aren\u2019t being paid what they believe (or know) themselves to be worth. A hydraulics unit is nearly always integral to the machinery using it and, as such, is repairable by qualified technician or mechanic who learns how to troubleshoot the equipment. Compressors rarely are, and they can become quite costly, especially if they fail in the middle of the night or on weekends. Unless your business can employ and retain a mechanic/technician who can perform most of the routine compressor tasks, things are going to get pricey, quickly. ",

            "answer_text": "One disadvantage compared to hydraulic systems is that there is energy stored in the fluid (gas), in the transmission pipes and the components connected to the pipes. This can complicate repairs. Even after a section of pipe is shut off from the air supply, you still have to find a way to safely depressurize it. You have to with hydraulics as well, but after only a small amount of hydraulic fluid is released, the section is depressurized except for the effects of gravity (head pressure, if any). Not so with pneumatic systems, which will flow for a long time compared to hydraulics. Incautious disconnecting of a component of a pneumatic system can result in it rocketing off dangerously because of stored pneumatic energy still remaining in the component. This is also a consideration if a component is accidentally broken off a system (think of an air hose if a connection fitting is accidentally broken off ) Another consideration is that a gas is harder to seal against leakage than a fluid, generally speaking. Pneumatic systems are therefore more prone to leakage, everything else being the same. ",

If you consider a large plant that uses are power for the process and for maintenance tasks, the amount of air power needed is daunting and air compressors use a lot of energy to get air to such a high pressure. You also have to deal with losses in piping and air leaks. ",
