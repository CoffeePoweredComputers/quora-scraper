            "answer_text": "Thermodynamic instability means a system exists that is not at equilibrium. That means that some kind of chemical reaction is thermodynamically possible. One of the results of thermodynamics is that a system at equilibrium at a given temperature and pressure is at a minimum of its Gibbs Free Energy. An unstable system has the potential to reach another state in such as way that lowers its Gibbs Free Energy. But it is important to keep in mind that thermodynamics only deals with equilibrium, not with the rates of reactions. This is to distinguish it from the system\u2019s reactivity. The latter has to do with the kinetics of possible reactions. A system could be far from thermal equilibrium but remain in that state indefinitely because the kinetics of the reaction are so slow as to preclude any discernable reaction at all. An example is a log for a campfire. It is far from thermodynamic equilibrium when it is piled up. It can stay that way indefinitely until it rots. It takes heat being applied to raise its temperature high enough so that the rate of its combustion reaction is high enough for it to burn and move toward its equilibrium state which is carbon dioxide and water vapor. \ufffdg}/(!\ufffd ",
