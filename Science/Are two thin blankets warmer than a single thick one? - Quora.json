            "answer_text": "Well, it depends upon these noted factors. The thickness of each single blanket and the thickness of single thick blanket and the thermal conductivity of the blanket material. Normally,if we combine two single thin blankets, we have to consider the air trapped, between these two layers which is considered as a fluid having low thermal conductivity (0.025 W/mK) termed as bad conductor of heat or insulator. The air layer between two thin blankets is stationary and it acts as thermal barrier for heat transfer across it where conduction heat transfer is only possible. Also the blanket material is very porous, meaning air molecules can be trapped inside. So as the number of blankets increases, the probability of having trapped air molecules increases. Hence it provides more resistance for heat transfer. So, analyzing heat transfer when two thin blankets are considered, the factors like trapped air molecules in blankets, the thickness of air layer between two thin blankets and the thermal conductivity of the blankets comes into play. So normally the heat transfer barrier in case of two thin blankets is high as compared to single thick blanket and thus two thin blankets makes us feel warm. The dominance of thermal resistance is usually high for two thin blankets as compared to single thick blanket. ",

            "answer_text": "I had a professor once who told me that the real answer to most questions in science is \"it depends\".  In this case, it depends on the blankets and the conditions. So, the reason wool has a similar conductivity to air is because most of the volume consists of trapped air.  In almost every thermal insulator, it's the air than insulates, so the quality of an insulator general depends on how much air it traps in relation to it's mass, and how well it keeps the air from moving.  If you were to compress the wool and squeeze most of the air out, or if you were to displace the air (say, by getting it wet), you'd find it's a much less effective insulator. The really important factor in how good any blanket is is how thick a layer of air it holds around you.  So, two 1\" thick blankets should have the same insulating power as a single 2\" thick blanket.  But, if the two blankets have an additional half inch pocket of air between them (which they often will), it adds more air thickness, which adds more insulation. In short, two blankets works better than one if the total thickness of those two blankets is more than one.  That's a fairly obvious effect, if you think about it, and it's really the only thing that's at play here. ",

            "answer_text": "Air is a great thermal isolator , even better than most clothing.The crimp of the wool produces insulating air spaces within the fleece, which reduce the flow of heat. So partly , wool also uses trapped air to enhance its property as an insulator. We usually don't perceive air as a great insulator because it moves around and causes evaporation of the  water on the surface of our skin, thus diminishing the temperature, making us feel cooler. However air is an excellent insulator. This can be seen in action in isolating windows. Most of these windows are basically two sheets of glass separated by air. Since the air is a great thermal isolator, the windows prevent heat exchange better than one made out of a single thick sheet of glass. The air between the thin blankets is not moving around and will form an isolating layer that acts exactly like another blanket, thus improving the thermal isolation. ",

            "answer_text": "Pretty much what they said. It really is about Air Flow, or lack thereof in the case of the two blankets. The blanket next to your skin gets the hottest, because the airflow though it is near zero even when tossing and turning. Then of course there is the second layer of air between the 2 layers. This area, again, is nearly temperature stable, but during turning and tossing there is a greater likelihood of some heat loss, due to separation flapping. Then the top layer against the cold air is the final barrier to the movement of internal air, and the heat within it to the outside. Plastic Bubble wrap is better than a double layer of the same kind of plastic in separate sheets held loose together, because of the less likelihood of air movement. ",
