            "answer_text": "The first step in the Scientific Method is to make objective observations. These observations are based on specific events that have already happened and can be verified by others as true or false. The reason for the pretence of having already happened serves as a distinguishing classification for a *theoretical idea. Even the best scientists are only human, and as such are subject to misperception, misinterpretation and to be blunt, straight-out hallucinations. This is the first fundamental reason that an observation should be verified by another person, typically a scientist or at the very least, an objective and reputable \u201csmart\u201d person. A second great reason why an observation should be verified is that what was observed, may have been explained and accepted through some previous scientific method. A third reason, and my personal favorite is when the outcome of an experiment results are unexpected. Rather than simply rejecting the hypothesis, a sound theory can warrant a new experiment. It can also help retain additional grant money for related investigation. *The Theoretical framework is the structure that can hold or support a theory of a research study. The theoretical framework introduces and describes the theory that explains why the research problem under study exists. No distinct observation is required. However, theoretical methods are principal in reproach, when an experiment results differ from the original hypothesis. It\u2019s all so confusing!!!  Should we begin a scientific investigation on why? Jason Lispi (I wish Quora was around when I had to take a school test. You luckies.) ",

            "answer_text": "What do scientific investigations always start with and why? The world around you is a huge mass of convoluted chaos which some how seems to work. A scientific investigation or research is an attempt by a very very simple animal called a human to try to unravel the almost infinite confusion which is the world we share (badly) with a myriad of other creatures. The way it is undertaken is to look at something that happens naturally and then a guess is made just how this could happen. That is the beginning. If you don\u2019t see something or look for something specific, you do not know it is there? For at least 13.8 billion years gravity has been causing so pretty weird stuff to happen but only in the last 333 years have we noticed that something causes the toast to fall to the floor (butter side down usually!). That is an observation which caused one rather clever bloke called Issac Newton to go \u201cHang on a minute, stuff falls downwards !\u201d As soon as the giant elephant in the room was pointed out, it was obviously there and always had been. The question was :-what the hell was it? That is the theory building bit that leads to research, and the rest is, well, gravity. ",
