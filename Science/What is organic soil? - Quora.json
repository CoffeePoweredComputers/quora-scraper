            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as organic soil. Because, soil itself is the complex mixture of minerals, water, air and organic matter where percentage of mineral is higher. But, we can say the soil with high organic matter. Generally, high organic matter are mainted in soil by using more healthy ( that means with high microbial communities) organic materials. The more the organic matter the more soil becomes healthy and lively. So, let's stop making definition of organic soil. But, try to make soil more healthy for better ecosystem. ",

            "answer_text": "Organic soil is dominated by organic matter and is referred to as muck or peat. It forms naturally where saturation by water slows the decomposition of plant materials. These soils often support bogs and fens. Organic soils are classified as Histosols by both the FAO World Soil Classification and U.S. Soil Taxonomy.  ",

What we in the industry consider is soil that hasn't been treated with any ind chem in the last 3 yrs, have been cert by the state as organic, is tested annually to keep certification. What others consider is open for discussion. We do occassionally use chem, but limit, we say we are IPM, more natural, hope this helps. ",
