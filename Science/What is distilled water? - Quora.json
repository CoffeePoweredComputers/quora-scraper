            "answer_text": "Distillation is a process where substances are separated based on their boiling points. If water is contaminated by substances with different boiling points from that of water, the water can usually be purified by distillation. To distill something, you must boil it and then condense the vapors and collect them in a different container. Substances with lower boiling points will distill off first. If the impurities in your water are solids at water\u2019s boiling point, they\u2019ll remain in the original container after the water has been boiled off. ",

            "answer_text": "Distilled water is created through the process of distillation. Basically, in the process of distillation, the pure H2O is boiled out of its contaminants. So, many of the contaminants found in water are inorganic minerals, metals etc. Those types of contaminants have very high melting points and even higher boiling points (way higher than the boiling point of water at 212 degrees F). So, as the water (with its contaminants) is boiled, the pure water turns into steam and is captured and cooled and thus becomes distilled water. The junk left behind is all of the contaminants. Distillation also makes water suitable for use in lead-acid batteries, automotive cooling systems and other devices where mineral buildup would cause damage. ",
