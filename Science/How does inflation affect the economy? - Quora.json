            "answer_text": "Inflation affects different people differently. This is because of the fall in the value of money. When price rises or the value of money falls, some groups of the society gain, some lose and some stand in-between. Broadly speaking, there are two economic groups in every society, the fixed income group and the flexible income group. People belonging to the first group lose and those belonging to the second group gain. The reason is that the price movements in the case of different goods, services, assets, etc. are not uniform. When there is inflation, most prices are rising, but the rates of increase of individual prices differ much. Prices of some goods and services rise faster, of others slowly and of still others remain unchanged. We discuss below the effects of inflation on redistribution of income and wealth, production, and on the society as a whole. 1. Effects on Redistribution of Income and Wealth: There are two ways to measure the effects of inflation on the redistribution of income and wealth in a society. First, on the basis of the change in the real value of such factor incomes as wages, salaries, rents, interest, dividends and profits.Second, on the basis of the size distribution of income over time as a result of inflation, i.e. whether the incomes of the rich have increased and that of the middle and poor classes have declined with inflation. Inflation brings about shifts in the distribution of real income from those whose money incomes are relatively inflexible to those whose money incomes are relatively flexible.The poor and middle classes suffer because their wages and salaries are more or less fixed but the prices of commodities continue to rise. They become more impoverished. On the other hand, businessmen, industrialists, traders, real estate holders, speculators, and others with variable incomes gain during rising prices.The latter category of persons becomes rich at the cost of the former group. There is unjustified transfer of income and wealth from the poor to the rich. As a result, the rich roll in wealth and indulge in conspicuous consumption, while the poor and middle classes live in abject misery and poverty.But which income group of society gains or losses from inflation depends on who anticipates inflation and who does not. Those who correctly anticipate inflation, they can adjust their present earnings, buying, borrowing, and lending activities against the loss of income and wealth due to inflation.They, therefore, do not get hurt by the inflation. Failure to anticipate inflation correctly leads to redistribution of income and wealth. In practice, all persons are unable to anticipate and predict the rate of inflation correctly so that they cannot adjust their economic behaviour accordingly. As a result, some persons gain while others lose. The net result is redistribution of income and wealth.The effects of inflation on different groups of society are discussed below: (1) Debtors and Creditors: During periods of rising prices, debtors gain and creditors lose. When prices rise, the value of money falls. Though debtors return the same amount of money, but they pay less in terms of goods and services. This is because the value of money is less than when they borrowed the money. Thus the burden of the debt is reduced and debtors gain.On the other hand, creditors lose. Although they get back the same amount of money which they lent, they receive less in real terms because the value of money falls. Thus inflation brings about a redistribution of real wealth in favour of debtors at the cost of creditors.(2) Salaried Persons: Salaried workers such as clerks, teachers, and other white collar persons lose when there is inflation. The reason is that their salaries are slow to adjust when prices are rising.(3) Wage Earners: Wage earners may gain or lose depending upon the speed with which their wages adjust to rising prices. If their unions are strong, they may get their wages linked to the cost of living index. In this way, they may be able to protect themselves from the bad effects of inflation.But the problem is that there is often a time lag between the raising of wages by employees and the rise in prices. So workers lose because by the time wages are raised, the cost of living index may have increased further. But where the unions have entered into contractual wages for a fixed period, the workers lose when prices continue to rise during the period of contract. On the whole, the wage earners are in the same position as the white collar persons.(4) Fixed Income Group: The recipients of transfer payments such as pensions, unemployment insurance, social security, etc. and recipients of interest and rent live on fixed incomes. Pensioners get fixed pensions. Similarly the rentier class consisting of interest and rent receivers get fixed payments.The same is the case with the holders of fixed interest bearing securities, debentures and deposits. All such persons lose because they receive fixed payments, while the value of money continues to fall with rising prices.Among these groups, the recipients of transfer payments belong to the lower income group and the rentier class to the upper income group. Inflation redistributes income from these two groups toward the middle income group comprising traders and businessmen.(5) Equity Holders or Investors: Persons who hold shares or stocks of companies gain during inflation. For when prices are rising, business activities expand which increase profits of companies. As profits increase, dividends on equities also increase at a faster rate than prices. But those who invest in debentures, securities, bonds, etc. which carry a fixed interest rate lose during inflation because they receive a fixed sum while the purchasing power is falling.(6) Businessmen: Businessmen of all types, such as producers, traders and real estate holders gain during periods of rising prices. Take producers first. When prices are rising, the value of their inventories (goods in stock) rise in the same proportion. So they profit more when they sell their stored commodities.The same is the case with traders in the short run. But producers profit more in another way. Their costs do not rise to the extent of the rise in the prices of their goods. This is because prices of raw materials and other inputs and wages do not rise immediately to the level of the price rise. The holders of real estate\u2019s also profit during inflation because the prices of landed property increase much faster than the general price level.(7) Agriculturists: Agriculturists are of three types, landlords, peasant proprietors, and landless agricultural workers. Landlords lose during rising prices because they get fixed rents. But peasant proprietors who own and cultivate their farms gain. Prices of farm products increase more than the cost of production.For prices of inputs and land revenue do not rise to the same extent as the rise in the prices of farm products. On the other hand, the landless agricultural workers are hit hard by rising prices. Their wages are not raised by the farm owners, because trade unionism is absent among them. But the prices of consumer goods rise rapidly. So landless agricultural workers are losers.(8) Government: The government as a debtor gains at the expense of households who are its principal creditors. This is because interest rates on government bonds are fixed and are not raised to offset expected rise in prices. The government, in turn, levies less taxes to service and retire its debt.With inflation, even the real value of taxes is reduced. Thus redistribution of wealth in favour of the government accrues as a benefit to the tax-payers. Since the tax-payers of the government are high-income groups, they are also the creditors of the government because it is they who hold government bonds.As creditors, the real value of their assets decline and as tax-payers, the real value of their liabilities also declines during inflation. The extent to which they will be gainers or losers on the whole is a very complicated calculation. ",

            "answer_text": " In 1971, a $1.00 bill had the same purchasing power as $5.95 does in 2016. That is, any fiat currency valued at $1.00 would only buy 16.8\u00a2 worth of goods in 1971. Inflation is in essence the decrease in the purchasing power of fiat currency, and is an economic force that will always be around as long as the global economy is growing, and paper currency is being printed. What causes inflation? Inflation is typically caused when the aggregate demand in an economy exceeds aggregate supply, meaning consumers spend more than an economy can output. This process decreases the purchasing power of the currency being used because producers have to raise prices in order to meet demand. Economists call this \u201cDemand-pull inflation,\u201d which simply put, means that a rising demand for consumption can only push prices up.  A common reason for this type of inflation stems from when a country\u2019s central bank rapidly increases the supply of money within an economy - this is called Quantitative easing. The increase in money within an economy will subsequently increase demand for goods and services. Because firms will not be able to respond to this rise in demand as quickly as need be, they must raise prices in order to counteract the greater need for consumption, thus, decreasing the purchasing power of each unit of currency. This injection of money into the economy by Central banks is referred to as monetary policy. Although, for example, printing money could be one measure to increase the money supply in an economy, this is usually only used in desperate measures. There are three main ways the Fed can influence the money supply: Modifying reserve requirements: the Central bank dictates the amount of funds banks are allowed to hold at any given time. By lowering the reserve requirements, banks are able loan more money, which increases the overall supply of money in the economy.Changing interest rates: The Fed has the power to lower or raise the discount rate that banks pay on short-term loans from the Fed. By doing so, the Fed is able to effectively increase (or decrease) the liquidity of money. It is important to keep interest rates stable however, as prolonged decreases in the discount rate will fuel inflation as banks will borrow much higher amounts.Open market operations: This is where the Fed buys and sells government securities and/or bonds in the open market. If the Fed wants to increase the money supply, it buys government bonds, which supplies the securities dealers who sell the bonds with cash, increasing the overall supply of money in an economy.The second main process that causes inflation is called cost-push inflation. This occurs when prices of production inputs increase. This can result from rapid wage increases or rising raw material prices for example.  Ontario for example is planning on implementing a $15 minimum wage in 2019 (up from $11.25) which will force producers to raise prices and minimize the quantity of labour they seek. A near $4 rise in the minimum wage will leave more workers unemployed and will cause a spike in inflation within Canada once implemented. While the differences in inflation noted above may seem simple, the cause of price level changes observed in the real economy are often much more complex. In a dynamic economy it can be especially difficult to isolate a single cause of a change in the price level. However, knowing what inflation is and what conditions might cause it is a great start! What is a good target for inflation? In an advanced economy, the Fed/central bank will actively increase and decrease the money supply through these actions in order to maintain a stable inflation rate. In most developed economies an inflation rate of 1\u20133% is considered healthy, and anything above 4% is cause for concern.  A great example of this is the average inflation rate of OECD countries which consist of the USA, UK, Germany, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, and several others, all of which have developed economies. By maintaining an inflation rate of 1\u20133%, central banks are maintaining longterm price stability which help prevent economies from collapsing detrimentally as seen in the 2008 financial crisis. If inflation were to spike out of this range as seen on a few occasions, most notably in 2008, then your average goods and services will become much more expensive in order to meet the falling demand for the latter. Inflation and Minimum Wages Inflation is inevitable when the global economy runs on fiat currencies, and large-scale debt-financing from banks and central banks and banks to the population. But a large problem developed economies face is that certain economic variables don\u2019t rise in correspondence with the inflation rate - minimum wages are a prime example of this.  This chart outlines the US economy, but this pattern can be seen in many other developed nations around the world. As it goes, minimum wages as adjusted for inflation began to lose their purchasing power beginning in the 1970\u2019s when it peaked. Basically, minimum wages have not risen as consistently as the inflation rate in the past several decades. Rather, governments wait until a public outcry for a rise in the minimum wage to actually raise it, a pattern that only adds more fuel to the fire.  Taking this same graph, it\u2019s important to realize that the periodic increases in the United States\u2019 minimum wage are not enough to adequately keep up with inflation. As outlined with the green and red arrows, a rise in the minimum wage increases purchasing power, but only for a few years. Each subsequent raise in the minimum wage has been larger than the last, but they always lead to the same outcome: a decrease in purchasing power. There is little evidence to support that raising minimum wages also increases inflation - there are many different variables at work here that don\u2019t have to do with minimum wages - but we can clearly see from this graph that since the 1970\u2019s, the US Federal Reserve has kept the purchasing power of those working at minimum wages at a minimum.  Wealth inequality is a clear result of inflationary pressures on the middle and lower classes of not only America, but many other developed nations. That is, if you fail to raise the minimum wage in relation to the inflation rate, the purchasing power of those working on minimum wages (most notably the middle to lower classes) is ultimately controlled by central bank quantitative easing/open market operation decisions. Like I said, it is difficult to prove that raising minimum wages in itself has the power to increase inflation, but when you think about it logically, it does make sense. Just as increasing the money supply by a Central bank will increase inflation, a rapid spike in the money supply of the middle to lower classes that is caused by a rise in the minimum wage should also, in theory, raise inflation rates. If this portion of the population has more money to spend, they will most likely spend it because their newly increased purchasing power will allow it for now - until of course, it falls again a few years later. To wrap this answer up, inflation fluctuates a great deal and is controlled primarily by central banks around the world. Capitalist economies offer more options for growth to those with the most money to spend, and hurts those with the least amount to spend, meaning that inflation hurts the poor more than it hurts the rich.
