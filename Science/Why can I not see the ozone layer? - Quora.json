            "answer_text": "The ozone which is present in a thin, diffuse, layer in the lower stratosphere, CAN be seen\u2014-not (consciously) by your eyes, but by your skin\u2014-not by is presence, which is protective, but by its absence. Without the protection of the zone layer, exposed skin would quickly start suffering damage which would soon be felt. Over time, the growth of cataracts in your eyes would make you blind, a process which actually occurred to sheep in Patagonia, when the \u201chole\u201d was at its peak in the late eighties. So don\u2019t assume, as many seem to do, that only things that can be seen with our eyes actually matter in our lives. Other senses also matter, including those beyond the traditional \u201c5\u201d.
