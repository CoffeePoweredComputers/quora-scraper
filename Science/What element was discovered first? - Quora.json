            "answer_text": "Hydrogen was the first element Nebulae formed from hydrogen.* Nebulae evolve, a spiral like our galaxy is typical. First generation stars formed, different sizes, some average, some of very large mass. The bigger the star the brighter and faster it burns, medium and smaller ones have a longer life When first generation stars collapsed and went supernova, other elements were formed. Second generation stars incorporate newer elements, and big ones going supernova generate even more complex materials. *The initial hydrogen is produced from space energies. Chemical elements identified in our sun Chemical elements identified in our sun Some biggie presentations there, do not miss, BBC et cetera, at least three in detail to do for sure, but real student ought to double that, at least. In my case I am saying nothing about a \u2018big bang\u2019 because I see no evidence for that, plus there is the constant precipitation of hydrogen from primordial little known space energies. The stars have to evolve a good while prior to suitable planets for life, this allows for a decent abundance of elements. There is tremendous violence earlier on too, things have to settle down a good bit prior to even higher beings there, let alone evolving beings. Our sun is average as to mass, a second generation (or later) star. One million miles diameter is average, so our Sun is smaller, I guess 1.2 million miles diameter still average. I am not an expert on this. How Big is the Sun? | Size of the Sun Evolution of nebulae in detail is in this book*** of about 2,097 pages. a sharp English language person can get a fair grasp of first half in six months, provided not delayed by trying to absorb total understanding about God prematurely in the beginning papers about Trinity.

Other natural elements are sulfur, gold, silver, chopper.As definition, ancient greeks created the definition of elements, but they called something very different thing under these word. (earth, air, fire, water).Chemical definition: \"In 1661, Robert Boyle proposed his theory of corpuscularism which favoured the analysis of  matter as constituted by irreducible units of matter (atoms) and,  choosing to side with neither Aristotle's view of the four elements nor  Paracelsus' view of three fundamental elements, left open the question  of the number of elements.The first modern list of chemical elements was given in Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 Elements of Chemistry, which contained thirty-three elements, including light and caloric. By 1818, J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius had determined atomic weights for forty-five of the forty-nine then-accepted elements. Dmitri Mendeleev had sixty-six elements in his periodic table of 1869.\" ",

Although elements such as Gold, Silver, Tin, Cooper, Lead and Mercury have been known since Antiquity, the First Scientific Discovery of an Element occurred in 1649 when Hennig Brand discovered Phosphorous. Phosphorus was first discovered in the late 1600s by Hennig Brand, who was conducting Experiments with Urine and collected Phosphorous from condensation. He thought he had discovered the Philosopher's stone, an item that would turn any metal into gold and decided to keep it a secret. ",

It was fist chemically prepared from urine in an accidental discovery in 1669 by German Alchemist Hennig Brand, making him the first person in history to have discovered an element.

This question would have been best answered by OUR Ancestors (Yes, my and your ancestors) living in Africa millions of years ago. During heavy thunderstorms they observed repeatedly over thousands of years that different trees caught fire from lightning strikes. What was left was something black and amorphous. Later they learnt to light fires and found similar black residue from the burnt wood. They started using the black residue for marking and other uses. This black residue was given many names in the local basic sound language- with time region. ",
