            "answer_text": "\u2022Any motion which repeats itself after an interval of time is called Vibration or Oscillations \u2022Vibration is a mechanical phenomenon where by oscillations occur about an equilibrium point. The word comes from Latin vibrationem (\"shaking, brandishing\"). The oscillations may be periodic or Random \u2022Vibration can be desirable: for example, the motion of a tuning fork, the reed in a woodwind instrument or harmonica, a mobile phone, or the cone of a loudspeaker.  \u2022In many cases, vibration is undesirable, wasting energy and creating unwanted sound. For example, the vibrational motions of engines or any mechanical device in operation are typically unwanted. Such vibrations could be caused by imbalances in the rotating parts. Careful designs usually minimize unwanted vibrations.  All bodies having mass and Elasticity capable of vibrationMain Reasons of Vibrations: Imbalance: Unbalanced centrifugal force in the system. This may be caused non uniform material distribution in a rotating machine element.A \u201cheavy spot\u201d in a rotating component will cause vibration when the unbalanced weight rotates around the machine\u2019s axis, creating a centrifugal force.Imbalance could be caused by manufacturing defects (machining errors, casting flaws) or maintenance issues (deformed or dirty fan blades, missing balance weights).Elastic: Elastic nature of the systemExternal excitation is applied on the system, Wind may cause vibration. For example electricity lines, telephone linesMisalignment/shaft runout: Vibration can result when machine shafts are out of line. Angular misalignment occurs when the axes of (for example) a motor and pump are not parallel.Wear: As components such as ball or roller bearings, drive belts or gears become worn, they might cause vibration.Looseness: Vibration that might otherwise go unnoticed can become obvious and destructive if the component that is vibrating has loose bearings or is loosely attached to its mounts.Read more about Vibrations: What are the important facts about mechanical vibration?
