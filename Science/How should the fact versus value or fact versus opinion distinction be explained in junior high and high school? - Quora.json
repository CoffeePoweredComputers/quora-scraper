            "answer_text": "It would appear that the writer of the article in question believes in absolute and knowable truth. How sweet and old fashioned. There are varying degrees of true, just as there are subjective judgements. Nothing at all is absolute. Imagine a spectrum, on one side you have stuff made up by children (no coherent narrative, absurd interjections, etc.) and on the other side you have really well done academic work, the kind that can only be entirely understood by experts in the field. That is the entire sum of what is capable of being seen by the human mind. There\u2019s stuff outside of it, because our sensory organs are faulty. Value is a subjective opinion based on certain observed facts. I know quite a few people who are quite emotionally invested in the stock market. That\u2019s what it is there for, because if you aren\u2019t emotionally invested in something, you won\u2019t put your assets within it. Yet over the past year the stock market has grown, while people have become poorer. Clearly as an index of human happiness and success, the market is a poor measure.  You at this point, assuming you believe in absolutes, are thinking; \u201cAh, but mine is different.\u201d There is no quality contained within any one person\u2019s subjective judgement, or what one person considers true that carries enough validity to be perfect. It is reasonable to assume that most people want to succeed. As such, there is no profitable use to faulty perception. Thus, if you make mistakes, they must at some point be due to faulty perception or faulty thought processes. In reality, there is use for varying levels of proof, and varying levels of subjectivity. Human life, for example, is considered the most sacred out of anything on this planet. Make it the life of a child and it is at a point we will devote any amount of resource to preserve it. On the other hand, consider the automobile. A rather utilitarian invention which culture has elevated to a status symbol. For those such as me, these are evaluations overinflated. Yet for those that sell cars, or make parts for them, these are essential things to convince people of. ",

            "answer_text": "I had frustrating experiences similar to Justin P. McBrayer\u2019s when my children were in school. C.S. Lewis explained the problem with the so-called distinction between fact and value very well in The Abolition of Man (1943). He did so by way of commenting on a book for British schoolchildren by Alec King and Martin Ketley \u2013 which, I find, is still in print \u2013 who made the distinction with the assistance of an anecdote about Wordsworth and Coleridge. In attacking it Lewis was taking on an especially hard case, namely the idea that aesthetic opinions cannot be statements of fact \u2013 a view that is not obviously wrong. Worsdworth and Coleridge once visited Moss Force, a waterfall in the Lake District. A tourist they encountered there called the waterfall \u201cmajestic,\u201d and Coleridge happily agreed. The tourist then went on to add that it was \u201csublime and beautiful,\u201d which Coleridge hotly (though silently) rejected. For Coleridge the words \u201cmajestic,\u201d \u201csublime,\u201d and \u201cbeautiful\u201d named three distinctly different aesthetic properties, and he went from thinking the tourist very precise to thinking him very confused about his words. He had hit on the right one first merely by chance. King and Ketley commented on Coleridge\u2019s encounter as follows: When the man said This is sublime, he appeared to be making a remark about the waterfall... Actually... he was not making a remark about the waterfall, but a remark about his own feelings. What he was saying was really I have feelings associated in my mind with the word \u2018Sublime\u2019, or shortly, I have sublime feelings. They added: This confusion is continually present in language as we use it. We appear to be saying something very important about something: and actually we are only saying something about our own feelings. For King and Ketley, that Moss Force is in the Lake District is a fact, but that Moss Force is majestic is a feeling. They are saying, in effect, that (a) attributions of aesthetic value are statements about the speaker\u2019s feelings and (b) attributions of aesthetic value are unimportant \u2013 remember, the authors say that when we attribute value we \u201cappear to be saying something very important,\u201d but in fact we are \u201conly saying something about our own feelings.\u201d There\u2019s a moral hazard here because our feelings are indispensable guides not only to what is good and bad but also to what is right and wrong. If we truly believed that values are subjective and unimportant, and that our emotional reactions to the world tell us nothing about it that matters, we wouldn\u2019t devote time and effort to understanding them, which would be morally coarsening and corrosive. We would become one of Lewis\u2019s \u201cmen without chests\u201d or \u201ctrousered apes.\u201d Students shouldn\u2019t be taught about facts versus values or opinions because, as McBrayer rightly points out, these terms are not really in opposition. They should be taught about how to establish the facts and to evaluate factual statements, how to form intelligent opinions and to distinguish between those and baseless ones, and how to cultivate their sensibilities so that they can serve as reliable indicators of what\u2019s good and bad and right and wrong. However, the original impulse to distinguish between fact and value was not unsound. It\u2019s usually associated with Max Weber\u2019s \u201cScience as a Vocation\u201d (1919). In that essay, Weber was cautioning against the use of scholarly authority to advance a moral, political, or religious agenda. This practice, which is all-too-familiar to us from today\u2019s advocacy organizations, consists of choosing from the available facts those that can be made to appear to support your cause, and ignoring the rest. The aim is to create the false impression that all the facts are on your side and that they \u201cspeak for themselves.\u201d This, Weber thought, was a betrayal of the scientific vocation. The social scientist ought rather to find the best explanation of why the world is as it is and let the chips fall where they may. But to think of scholarly integrity and independence in terms of an opposition between facts and values is misleading and unnecessary. All that scholarly integrity requires is a commitment to truth. One determines the facts, forms opinions, and adjudicates values in roughly the same way: by impartially considering all the available evidence, perspectives, and explanations with the aim of arriving at the best possible understanding the circumstances allow.
