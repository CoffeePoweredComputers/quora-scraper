            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. However, since I am unsure as to what scope this question covers, I will do my best to answer from a educational, business point and personal standpoint. Educational Research and Studies - Your best bet would be to go to the sources that can provide you with more information in whatever topic area you are seeking to research or study. This could be public informational library databases, Google, and college information offices. Business Research and Studies - As above, this also depends on the area you are focusing on and the type of business you are interested in. Google has proven to be a great source for information if you utilize the right key words in yoru search. Getting whatever you want - a broad term - is simple: What do you want? More money? A new house? A nice luxury car? A holiday in France? A new boyfriend or girlfriend? An athletic body? Whatever it is, it is a physical result, is it not? Physicality. Why? For what feeling? So you can feel secure? Happy? Fulfilled? Whatever the reason is, it so that you can feel good, feel free, and experience satisfaction of some kind. It is to enjoy your self one way or the other. Feeling. Step 1: Ask How do you ask and who do you ask it to? You don't have to address your asking to anything or anyone or any deity. The asking is simply your desire and how you feel about it. Step 2: The Universe Answers Literally, scientifically, the universe creates your desire. It handles the \"how\". So the more you let go and allow life to unfold as it does, the faster you let creation happen for you. Let go of the how, so that you can allow it to come to you in the fastest way possible, including ways you would never have thought about. If you insist on the how, you block other pathways and possibilities. Also, let go of the need, of the anxiety, insecurity, shame, guilt, or whatever, because these feelings only create. Let go internally and externally. Step 3: Receive This is the final step and the one that most people seem to mess up. You must receive. You will notice opportunities cropping up in your days. Take them. If you meet someone who somehow mentions something to do with what you are seeking, follow that clue. If you feel the urge to make a phone call or visit a place, do that. It may take one step or a thousand, and you won't always know how far down the road you have come, but you are guaranteed to get there if you keep taking one step at a time. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, it depends what you look for. Here are a few tips: (1)When using Google, you can always specify what kind of answers you want. For instance \u201cbusiness site:edu\u201d will show you all the answers coming from education sites. It will give you schools, also access to what educators feel important. \u201cbusiness site:gov\u201d shows answers coming from government. You\u2019ll have access to info about taxes and statistics. I use keywords like \u201cstats\u201d and \u201cnews\u201d and \u201cmaps\u201d for almost anything (women\u2019s vote, obesity, \u2026). Maps and stats turn out surprising results. (2) scientific articles are found on \u201cgoogle scholar\u201d and you can choose to search for the papers published in 2016 or any earlier period. (3) I always look at \u201cgoogle books\u201d that gives you access to any information from millions of books. Go to google books and use key words, for instance who was the US ambassador to such country in such year. (4) If you look for bibliography in a field that you know nothing about, I recommend that you follow free college courses (called MOOCs) from the best universities of the world with Coursera or EDx . Usually they have a bibliography that is up to date with the best references. ",
