            "answer_text": "Q: Why is God present everywhere in nature? A: That's a claim made by many theists, it's not a claim that can be supported with evidence. Before anyone can answer such a question, the anonymous god you are talking about needs to be evidenced. Oh, and while you're about it, you need to disprove all the many thousands of other gods, whose followers dignify their deities with names, and name days of the week and planets after them. ",

You listen and you hear the wind trussle the long grass in the meadow to a distant soft whistle. The sun beats off your skin and you squint as you inhale the freshness where you are feeling everything and its feeling is within you let\u2019s you feel that you are part of everything. An epiphany hits you as you begin to understand what is outside of you is really within you. You give thanks, but in the deep moistened movement of thought you realize you are God. Overtaken by awe you shiver as every electric neuron fires into the plasm of the unknown, and you are at one with everything. Why is God present everywhere in nature? Because you are God and God is you. ",
