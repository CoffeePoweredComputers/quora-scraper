            "answer_text": "We get our energy from food. Two epic tragedies from the last century saw Stalin confiscate peasant food and up to 30 million peasants starved and died. The tragedy was repeated in China by Mao Zedong and up to 60 million peasants died. Stop eating and you slowly starve and die. So where does our food, plants and vegetables and fruit, get its energy from? The sun. Animals live on plants and thus they ultimately get their energy from the sun too. So the sun is the source of energy on earth. Why can you do a day\u2019s work? Because the sun is shining. Sunlight is about 47% light and 47 % infra red that produces heating and 6 % ultraviolet (harmful). Photosynthesis turns sunlight into food. The infrared keeps the atmosphere warm for us delicate human beings. We know the photosynthesis process, called the Kreb\u2019s cycle, but we cannot duplicate it to make our own food. So we still have to rely on plants to do that function. We are 43 % human and the rest of us, mainly lining the digestion tract and gut, consists of bacteria, viruses, fungi etc. They perform the vital task, which we cannot do on our own, of digesting the food and extracting the sun\u2019s energy from it. Some of this food and energy goes into making new proteins to replace the worn out proteins in our bodies. Some we use to do useful work as in walking, cooking, gym, pushing a pen, tapping a keyboard, reading or thinking which pushes neurotransmitters around between our brain cells etc. Much of the food gets burned up in our cells to produce body warmth. This energy is degraded in the process and appears as heat energy which cannot be collected and used to do useful work. The energy input of a person is due to the food that has miraculously trapped the sun\u2019s energy. That is balanced by an output of useful work when we focus our energy on some task plus an output of body heat energy that seldom does any useful work as the energy radiates out in all directions instead of being focused in one direction. Energy input equals energy output. The total energy transfer is a zero sum. Energy input from the food is useful energy. Energy output is partly useful work done and partly degraded energy that does nothing useful. So some of the useful energy input is wasted by us humans. Thus we are inefficient energy users. And so the sun keeps pumping in excess energy to keep us inefficient energy gobbling humans going. Thus the final end of the sun\u2019s energy is to appear as warmth in our atmosphere as our body temperature pumps out heat energy day and night. Some of this body-warmth energy adds to the heat energy content of the atmosphere. Some is reflected out to the cold of space. Some gets absorbed by plants to help their cycle. When a person dies they stop absorbing food energy and also stop giving out energy as body warmth and any work that they did. So there is still a zero sum energy transfer. Zero energy absorbed equals zero energy given out. So only in death is the energy equation efficient. Saint Paul said we must die to self. The less we think of self, the more efficient we become. But whether you live or die, the sun keeps shining. ",

            "answer_text": "The laws of thermodynamics state that energy cannot be created or destroyed. When you die, the atoms that make up your body disperse to create new things. There also remains much debate about whether there may exist forms of \"energy\" (auras, souls, etc) outside of atoms and molecules that make up a human being. \u201cAs we know through thermodynamics, energy can not be created nor destroyed.. it can simply change states. The total amount of energy in an isolated system does not, cannot, change. And thanks to Einstein, we also know matter and energy are two rungs on the same ladder. The universe as a whole is closed. However, human bodies (and ecosystems alike) are not closed systems, but open systems-we exchange energy with our surroundings. We can gain energy (again, through chemical processes) and we can lose it (by expelling waste or emitting heat). In death, the collection of atoms that comprise you (a universe within the universe) are repurposed. These same atoms, and this energy, which originated during the big bang, will always be around. Therefore, your \"light\"-that is, the essence of your energy (not to be confused with your actual consciousness)-will continue to echo throughout space until the end of time.\u201d Source- http://futurism.com/the-physics-of-death/ ",

            "answer_text": "This is an easy one :) Disclaimer: In this answer I will talk solely about physical energy (heat, chemical energy, etc.). I don\u2019t know or care where anyone stands on the entire spirituality debate, and I won\u2019t share my opinion either. :) After our deaths, the energy contained in us simply disperses into the surrounding environment. As our bodies (or giblets) cool, the excess heat energy we possess in life is distributed to the surrounding air, liquid, or objects our bodies are in contact with. Furthermore, the energy contained in the compounds in our bodies (sugar, fat, protein, almost everything) disperses as well. The bacteria and other organisms that decompose us absorb some of it, and much of it is lost too as heat to our surroundings as the chemicals break apart (either when eaten by decomposers or naturally) into smaller, lesser-energy forms. In summary, after the death of the human body (or any other, for that matter) the energy in it is dispersed to its surroundings, either in the same form or a different one, becoming one with the energy already in the surroundings and dissolving into it, ready to be absorbed by another living, growing organism. :) P.S. This is my first answer on Quora, so please give me any feedback and tell me if I did anything wrong! ",
