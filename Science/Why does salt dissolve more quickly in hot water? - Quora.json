            "answer_text": "Hii , Salt would dissolve quicker in hot water because the molecules in hot water move faster than cold water because of the higher energy, therefore the molecules of hot water move fast, they can more easily break apart the other molecules of a different substance when they come into contact and also the latent heat of vaporisation comes into play.

            "answer_text": "The increased energy product by the heat causes the water molecules to move faster, in the process creating more space between them. This increased space makes it easy for the salt molecules to make contact with the water. This makes the dissolving process faster. This is one of the simple experiments you can do even at home, try it out! ",
