            "answer_text": "I don't do scary, but i do weird really well. So here goes my list of weirdest flicks. If by weird you mean offbeat. Inside (\u00c0 l'int\u00e9rieur, 2007)  I won't tell you what the movie is about. Watch it yourself. The plot is simple with an awesome twist in the end. Warning- the last 15 minutes is a bloodbath. Eyes without a face (Les yeux sans visage, 1960)  Not much of a horror flick and a only little bit thriller but it was a pioneering work of art, raising important questions about breakthroughs in medicine of the time. Antichrist (2009)  The child of the lead couple dies in an accident. The accident is not of the normal kind. The woman is heartbroken and they retreat to their property in the woods for calm and peace. What ensues is the most disturbing chain of events you've probably ever seen. Warning - VERY explicit scenes ahead. Very. The Thing (1982)  I'm sorry Akshay, i just HAD to steal this from your list. The Thing is without a doubt the most terrifying monster/alien movie ever. The concept portrayed in the film is unstoppable - you cannot kill it with guns because its everywhere, its in you too. There were no sequels of this film because there really is no way it could have a good ending where the thing has been defeated. It is said in the movie to have come here after extinguishing life on millions of other planets. A prequel did come out - The Thing (2011) to show what happened to the Norwegians who die in the beginning of the movie. Watch both movies end to end. The Happening (2008)  Another original horror by M. Night Shyamalan. What happens when the trees decide that human beings are too much of a nuisance and decide to end us all? Yes, the trees. They drive us to the point of extinction. Watch this movie. The Host (2006)  Not to be confused with The Host (2013). This is a Korean movie. We have all seen monster movies where the military rolls in at the end and takes care of things. The monsters lose, thanks to gun power and extensive KABOOM sequences. But what if you were stuck in the middle of all this with your family? Without any guns? Not so macho now, eh? Normal life has been uprooted and more than just survival is at stake. As above, so below (2014)  A shaky cam flick, it revolves around the experience of a bunch of historians and catacomb enthusiasts as they explore the restricted parts of Paris's catacombs system. They soon find out that every attempt to come back up magically takes them even deeper. A total mindfluff movie, worth a watch. Exists (2014)  Its a bigfoot (yeti/sasquatch) movie. And yes, that's a tree driven through a car turned upside down. The movie progresses from intriguing to scary to RAW PANIC rather quickly in the second half. The first person narrative shown through helmet cams, handycams, bike cams delivers it with great effect. It particularly managed to scare me well because of my innate fear of size and intelligence. images from:Stream and Download Videos FangirlNation Magazine | Entertainment news, reviews, interviews, games, and cosplay WordPress.com DownloadFilmTerbaru.com is for sale Eclectic Boredom Way Too Indie - Independent Movie Reviews, TV News, Awards HD Wallpapers (High Definition) | 100% Quality HD Desktop Wallpapers  ",
