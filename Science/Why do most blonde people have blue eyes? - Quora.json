            "answer_text": "The gene which determines that a person will have blonde hair is found on the same chromosome as the gene which determines that a person will have blue eyes. That said, since the number of people above the age of 12 who actually have blonde hair naturally is so small, but the number of women who purchase blonde hair is so large\u2026.probably the single most popular color choice of our generation\u2026.maybe the question should be why do we place a higher value or consider blonde hair more desirable than other colors. I often wonder as humans, are we evolving to a place where there is no longer going to be a need for hair at all on our heads. Does hair offer some trait that can make our survival easier? Although I have made a very good life for myself as a hair designer\u2026.I think about how much easier our lives would become if we simply had no hair. We could save so much time & money over the course of our lives if we were all bald. Besides vainity, is there still a real need for humans to produce hair? ",

People whose ancestry is Northern Europe tend to be fair skinned, blond hair, tow headed (this is a common phrase in the Northern west of the U.S. for children with nearly white hair, which I had as a child,) children,  with eye colors of either blue or green. (Mine are green.) They also tend to have deep blood vessels and are more susceptible to sun damage and related diseases then are other ethnicities. ",
