            "answer_text": "A really basic idea is that the best, most excruciating scientists try to falsify notions, whether the notion originates from them or from someone else. Scientists are thus a subset of all the people who call themselves researchers. This idea is tossed on the sidewalk and danced upon in practice. People with what appear to be serious credentials try to use these to push nonsense ideas. People with apparently serious credentials cherry-pick data or theories when it suits their belief systems, and likewise cherry-pick evidence that seems to oppose scientific theories they don\u2019t like. Fortunately, you don\u2019t need credentials to be a scientist. Look at Michael Faraday: he had very little formal education, but is regarded today as one of the founders of the sciences of electrochemistry and electromagnetism. What you need is Faraday\u2019s wisdom, which is to set aside received knowledge, and set about proving ideas for one\u2019s self. If you do this, you will be both a researcher and a scientist. ",

A researcher can become a scientist and a scientist can become a researcher. How is this possible? Well, one need basic education and clear planning and to secure a position in an academic or research or NHS establishment. Typically, having a bachelor or master degree will help. Those with PhD degree can become team leader etc. Also, ability to conduct investigation is essential. Both positions are very rewarding and lead to discovery of things that community need to empower and upgrade. ",

In that case you have a really good carer scope of becoming a research scientist. Well it's not compulsory that you should go go research scientist only , I may also deepen on the field or the area you are interested into. that is, choosing a particular stream and doing complete research on the topic, as research is a part of scientific discovery. Talking about research scientist , what they do : Research scientist work in almost every area of science imaginable. They plan and carry out experiments and investigation in a range of areas which includes geoscience , medical research, meteorology and pharmacology. There are a lot of job opportunities available at government as well as private sectors as a research scientist. But all that it requires is your interest and your passion. ",

But for practical purposes, there is no big difference, mainly it is a matter of convention. Usually a researcher is one who does any kind of research ( even in literature, or sociology or non-science topics), while a scientist is the one who do research in science, and is affiliated with certain organizations. So, work in any scientific organization, you will be called a scientist. If start working on any topic with research bent of mind, you can claim as a researcher. ",
