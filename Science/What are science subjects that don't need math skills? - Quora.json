            "answer_text": "TL;DR: No science can be done without some mathematics.  Nowadays, all processes where you use the scientific method to disprove an hypothesis requires at least an understanding of statistics, and consequently probability and some set theory.  I think that many of what are called \"soft sciences\" still need mathematics for results to be properly interpreted. Take the examples given in other answers: Biology: there is lots of mathematics, from coupled systems for ecosystem modeling, to biocomputing. Psychology: any psychological study that wants to determine whether we react like this or like that needs to perform an hypotheses test. Moreover there is a lot of descriptive statistics needed. Zoology: anything wanting to go beyond simplistic phenotypic classification and on to genetic classification will need math to do that, like Bayesian statistics. Anatomy: anything relating to movement needs physics and math and anything that wants to go beyond the specimen under observation and generalise will require mathematical modelling. Of course simple descriptive anatomy is not really a science but a collection of drawings and plates.Chemistry: try doing it without math and you will see the - possibly explosive - results. It needs between a little to a lot of math, but not none. So my bottom line is that any proper scientific conclusion will have an amount of math underlying it. Of course many people practice some pseudo-science by using their intuition or random things alone, but those only help the world move backwards. ",

            "answer_text": "In theory, all of them. At the core, science is about the concepts and learning the concepts shouldn't require doing any calculations. In fact, I feel that emphasis on calculations is a major flaw in how science, physics in particular, is taught in U.S.high schools. Practically speaking, finding a science course that doesn't use math at all will be hard. Biology should have fewer calculations than other areas, but I'd talk to the professors for the particular courses that seem interesting. If you don't need credit and just want to learn, shows like Minute Physics would be a good place to start. ",
