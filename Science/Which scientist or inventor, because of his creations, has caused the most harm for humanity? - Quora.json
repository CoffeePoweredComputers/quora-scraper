            "answer_text": "Thomas Midgley, 1889 to 1944, who discovered, in 1921 whilst working for GM, that the addition of Tetraethyl lead to gasoline/petrol reduced engine \u2018knock\u2019 The clues to how bad leaded fuel was for humans were fairly obvious, Midgley spent a prolonged holiday in Florida to recover from lead poisoning; two workers at the Dupont factory in Dayton Ohio died from lead poisoning and a further eight died at the Dupont plant in New Jersey, other workers suffered hallucinations and insanity. By the late twenties the Frigidaire division of GM was looking for a non-toxic, non flammable refrigerant for use in the emerging air conditioning and refrigeration market. Once again Mr Midgley stepped up to the plate, finally synthesizing Dichlorodifluoromethane of Freon 12, the first Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) In 1940 Midgley contracted Polio which left him severely disabled but he devised a system of ropes and pulleys to lift himself out of bed. On November the 2nd 1944 he became entangled in his invention and strangled himself. He is said to have had the most impact on the atmosphere than any other organism in the history of this planet; the author Bill Bryson wrote that he possessed \u201can instinct for the regrettable that was almost uncanny\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Gunpowder was discovered in China sometime during the first millennium AD. The very earliest possible reference to gunpowder appeared in 142 AD during the Eastern Han dynasty when the alchemist Wei Boyang wrote about a substance with the properties of gunpowder. Power and wealth became the catalyst for rulers and dictators to invade other territories. The Armaments industry (Alfred Nobel: He named it \u201cdynamite.\u201d He also invented a detonator or blasting cap which could be set off by lighting a fuse. ) then resulted in wars for profit to increase capital and wealth for individuals and countries - self enrichment and self aggrandizement. The evolution end result, was the atom bomb, hydrogen bomb and the nuclear bomb and essentially the root causation of capitalization and financialization in the first place, now becoming so powerful in our lives that monetization, even though it is illusionary \u2018Fiat\u2019 and pure legerdemain by the central banks and governments, rules our very lives.
