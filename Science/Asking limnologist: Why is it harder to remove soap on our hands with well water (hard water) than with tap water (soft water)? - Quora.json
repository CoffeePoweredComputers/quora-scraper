            "answer_text": "Soap doesn\u2019t suds (form bubbles) as well with hard water. Soapy water makes water more slippery and encapsulates dirt and grease so that it detached from the surface of what you are trying to wash and can be rinsed away. With hard water that doesn\u2019t happen so well and you can actually end of with soap scum clinging to what you are trying to wash once the water is gone soap can actually end up making dirt and oils cling to the surface even more. That\u2019s one of the reason I guess why washers have a separate rinse cycle and why I\u2019ve known people with hard water to actually towel off and then get back into the shower for a second round. The dry towel helps to rub off the clinging soap and the a pure water rinse attempts to get the rest of it out ",

            "answer_text": "Not a limnologust, but : hard water has multi-charged metal ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, these combine with anionic soap molecules to make soap 'scum' so less soap to deal with the oils and dirt you're trying to wash away \u2014 this is less of a problem with non-ionic detergents. And tap water can be just as hard, depends on its source and treatment. ",
