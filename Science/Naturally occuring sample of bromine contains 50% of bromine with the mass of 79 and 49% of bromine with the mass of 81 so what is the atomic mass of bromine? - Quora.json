            "answer_text": "The percent relative abundance of the major bromine isotopes is what determines atomic mass\u2026but which is listed on the periodic table. If there is a great deal of one isotope vs the other, the atomic mass shows this. Oxygen is 16.00. That means the amount of 17O and 18O in existence must be very low or negligible since oxygen 16 (8 protons, 8 neutrons) is close to 16. Hydrogen has a mass of 1.008 amu. But you can\u2019t have fractional nuclear particles\u2014protons and neutrons. The atomic mass accounts for the different isotopes in any given sample of an element. But we know that protium 1H is over 99% abundance because the mass is so much closer to 1.0 than 2.0 for the next most abundant isotope of hydrogen, 2H or deuterium. In looking at the atomic mass this way you get a feeling for the relative abundance of isotopes, instead of simply using the atomic mass that is listed. The percent relative abundance gives the atomic mass. And it\u2019s known by countless experiments to chemists to be 79.90 g/mol. So the percent abundance\u2019s must be flipped. You would get an answer greater than 80 g/mol If 81Br were more abundant. I realize, this was probably intentional. However, the biggest issue is: what comprises the other 1%? Is it Br 82 or 83 or 84? Did you round those percentages? We want it to be equal to 100%. Nevertheless, the atomic mass of Bromine should be around 80 since 79 and 81 isotopes make up about each half of any sample of Br you find anywhere. I realize this is a practice problem, and you should by design get an inaccurate number\u2026so, the periodic table doesn\u2019t help if you put the real number you\u2019ll get a smiley face in red ink. Its probably greater than 80\u2026.I hope the math makes more sense which is\u2026 Atomic mass = [(mass of isotope)(% abundance) + ((mass of isotope1)(% abundance) + \u2026..]/100% <=> 100% of all isotopes are accounted for. The actual percent abundance\u2019s of bromine are 50.5% 79 Br and 49.5% Br\u2014these % values are meant to show congruence with the known and accepted Br atomic mass of 79.9 g/mol. ",
