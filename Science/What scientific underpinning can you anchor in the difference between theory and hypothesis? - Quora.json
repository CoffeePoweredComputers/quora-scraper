            "answer_text": "A theory can be stated about anything by anyone to explain an observation, some observations, or a set of data or experimental results. It may be theoretical and detailed, having been argued from some observations or data but have no other experimental provenance. It may be based on considerable experimental evidence from multiple different sources. It may be sketchy. It can be modified. Theories can coalesce. In all cases the core attributes of a theory are that it must be testable and make predictions. Hypotheses are the means of testing ideas drawn from a set of observations or experimental results, or predictions made by a theory. They must be falsifiable and verifiable. Hypotheses are at the core of the scientific method. Results of tested hypotheses go toward proposing a new theory, buttressing an existing theory, can be used to extend a theory, or may refute a theory. A very readable account of the process of scientific endeavour is contained a recently published book The Genesis Quest: The Geniuses and Eccentrics on a Journey to Uncover the Origin of Life on Earth by Michael Marshall published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson 2020. It explains the variety of theories of the origin of life, the predictions they make, and the hypotheses and experiments used to test them. It is a very accessible account of the rise and fall of theories. Some fall by the wayside through argument based on existing data and observations unforeseen or unknown to the person proposing the theory, others languish in the doldrums through lack of interest or being too difficult to test with current technology or are seen as too risky to spend a lot of time on given limited research funding, and others are seen as too loopy to want to attach one's name to. Others are considered untestable - they go nowhere, until .... someone sees something tangible and runs with it decades later, a testable hypothesis is formulated, a flurry of experimental work, unfortunately little in the way of meaningful results, and the theory goes back to the doldrums. In all experimental sciences there is a level of rigour when it comes to designing experiments and publishing results. And in completing a thesis for a post grad degree it is expected you clearly understand the nature of a theory and an hypothesis. In a preamble to your studies you would discuss existing theories and may critique published experimental evidence and the hypotheses formulated in these reports. Your hypothesis would be clearly stated, formulated from observational data, in the context of an existing theory (whether a theoretical theory or an experimentally supported theory), and considering existing published studies. Note that your hypothesis may be designed to demonstrate a flaw in the theory, given observational data that suggest the theory is incomplete or inadequate. Keep in mind theories must have predictive power. Your hypothesis may test a prediction given the prevailing theory. Your experiments would be clearly designed to test the hypothesis, and a conclusion drawn as to whether your reults support the hypothesis. More often than not this would require a statistical evaluation of the results. You would also be expected to discuss your results in the context of the existing theory, or you may even propose a new theory. When reading the scientific literature the rationale for the study will often be expressed in different ways, rather than formally stating an hypothesis. The hypothesis may be stated in the introduction, or may not even be explicitly stated until the discussion of results. It may be referred to after some explanatory description of the study eg. \"to confirm this hypothesis\", \"to test this hypothesis\", and may be expressed in varying ways eg. \"raise the intriguing hypothesis\", \"further experimentation will be required to prove this hypothesis\", \"we hypothesized that\", \"Together, these observations suggest that ...and further experiments investigating \u2026. will be required to confirm this hypothesis\u201d, \"We searched for changes in ....... , on the basis of the hypothesis that\u2026\". The study may be described in terms of a theory, without explicitly stating the hypothesis, eg. \"On the basis of the above theory, we propose a simple method for choosing the dimensions of a support foil to prevent buckling .....\" - the hypothesis is implied, and could be stated with rewording. It is understandable this can be quite confusing to someone not in direct contact with everyday scientific endeavour. Particularly given the casual and imprecise way these terms are used in everyday conversation and in the media. Even in the laboratory tea room or over coffee at a scientific conference ideas may be bounced around and proposal made, and yet the terms theory or hypothesis not ever used. However when it comes to getting back to the lab and sitting down to test these ideas, the formulation of hypotheses is essential to clarifying one's thoughts and designing meaningful experiments with the resources and time at hand.

            "answer_text": "Scientifically, the difference depends on the specific group using the language at a particular moment in time. At some times in some groups, the words are used interchangeably. At some times in some groups, either one term or both are not used at all. If you wanted to do a survey of how both terms were used by, say, American herpetologists in the early 1950s, it\u2019s easy enough to do pull up the publication from that time period and see what they did. What we can say with certainty, though, is that neither term has ever had a standardized definition, nor have there ever been any scientific organizations in charge of evaluating whether a certain model has attained the official level of \u201chypothesis,\u201d \u201ctheory,\u201d \u201claw,\u201d or \u201cdogma.\u201d We can said with equal certainty that there have been several dumbed-down versions of philosophy of science taught at American elementary and secondary schools that give them impression that a hypothesis is a \u201cguess\u201d and a theory is a \u201csuccessful guess with evidence.\u201d If you want to label \u201cmore-tentative models\u201d as hypotheses and \u201cless-tentative models\u201d as theories, that\u2019s fine, but that doesn\u2019t constrain how scientists use those terms or change how those terms were used in the past.
