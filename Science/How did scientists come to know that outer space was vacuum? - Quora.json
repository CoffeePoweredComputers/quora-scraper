            "answer_text": "Lovely question. Of course billows are as old as metalworking, so the point that air had to be something and could be compressed became clear. The ancient Romans had pumps that pulled water out of mines. They discovered that there was a limit in how far you could go down to draw up water. It took however some time before glass tubes were strong and practical enough to begin measure water and mercury pressure. A dude by the name of Pascal in 1640 figured out that by inverting a tube in a mercury bath he could observe atmospheric pressure changes which lead to the barometer. He did also check and realised that people living at higher altitude would experience less of this air pressure and theorized that at even greater heights there be possible no air at all. The first official vacuum pump was invented in 1650 by Otto von Guericke, who demonstrated the power of a vacuum with the so called Magdeburg hemispheres, two balls that could not be pulled apart by horses. A century later hot air balloons soon took to the air (Montgolfier) with animals to see if they could breath. It became clear that there was a height limit caused by less air pressure and that people would pass out or die, if flown high enough. High altitude balloons and early rockets confirmed that indeed there is not much air at all above some 50 km. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a universal myth that outer space is a vacuum. The fact is, vacuum is completely a hypothetical concept. Reality countered in the subject of quantum physics suggests that empty space is filled with pairs of \u201cghostly\u201d[1] particles which pops in and out of existence all the time. These particles are not real like electrons and protons but they are virtual and made up of pure energy. [1]-The particles are termed ghostly as not much is known about their existence. The time period between their evolution and degeneration is so small that it is practically impossible to hold them apart and observe their behaviour. However, different team of scientists from around the world are collaborating together to create \u201cspace like situations\u201d on Earth and study the properties of these mystery particles. ",
