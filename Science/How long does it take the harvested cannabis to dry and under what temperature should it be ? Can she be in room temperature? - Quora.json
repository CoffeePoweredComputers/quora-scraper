            "answer_text": "10 -14 days . Curing is very controversial . Let's stick to first step of curing the dry . Room temperature for a nice suburban house is ok 68 \u2014 73. Lower is better its like a crock pot . Slow and low . I'd say 60 \u2014 62 is ideal . Unless there are mold spores . If moldy flash dry in 115 -120 room for 6-8 hours with a additional heater / fireplace is my go too because wood fire also lowers humidity. Then back to slow and low . Low humidity 40 \u2014 45 for all 10 - 14 days is important . Wait for midsize stem to snap by hand when checking on your metal clothes hangers full of herb.once it snaps transfer to storage bin . ( AFTER DE \u2014 LEAFING ) ALL THIS MUST HAPPEN IN DARKNESS. no sunlight it kills thc . Turn in tote/bin for uniformity and so you dont squishe bottom layer . Leave on stem / close leaves for now they protect and slow cure . Now buck / remove buds from stem . Into glass jars . Now they should be sticky and ready to smoke . If ash turns grey . On bottom of bowl it's well dried / likely organic if it was grown with chemicals . You dont deserve this answer .if you got more questions I got a pay pal ",

            "answer_text": "We like to prolong the drying process for about two weeks. Humidity level is more important than temps. Room temps are OK. However, if you have a small crop or are drying inside a house, trimming flowers and then putting in paper bag to slow drying process works well. Here in Oregon, we can harvest and then hang in a shed with ventilation to get a perfect dry/cure. When the dry is finished, that doesn\u2019t mean the flowers are bone dry. The process isn\u2019t complete after the initial drying. We then cure the flowers by sealing in containers for part of the day, and opening containers to let breath for the balance. This process can take another week or two. ",
