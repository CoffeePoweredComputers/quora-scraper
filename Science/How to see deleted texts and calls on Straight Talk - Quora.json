I've also got a couple of call blockers so that might change things a bit. I can block numbers for text. Don't receive any notifications but can go into my message/text icon and go into the menu/settings and then into block numbers and pull up any blocked numbers texts. I only know Android. Apple/IOS I don't know how similar or different they operate. Again I can pull up my call log or blocked texts and still can monitor calls and texts I've blocked. They are a pain because they keep coming. P.S. Can't reproduce but my blocked calls show up with a back slash inside a circle. ",

No matter which way we go, we cannot foresee where it will take us, nor how the other would have turned out. I had to know what was truly going down with my husband sudden behaviours, cause I ran out of patience with leaning on trust. We can do our best to make good decisions, but we\u2019ll never truly know how much worse or better an alternative might have been. So I got in touch with a specialist I was referred to here \u201cStevey Fletcher\u201c to get me answers. And so, we mustn\u2019t regret the road not taken. With what I saw, no regrets whatsoever. ",
