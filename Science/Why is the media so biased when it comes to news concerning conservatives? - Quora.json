            "answer_text": "Why is the media biased against conservatives? Short Answer: In the USA they are MOSTLY owned and operated by liberals who pander to other liberals. Longer Answer: The media, you can hardly call it news any longer, runs a business. Liberal media sources can and do, ignore stories that might be damning to their cause, which is promoting the liberal agenda, or they can alter the stories to place blame on anyone who stands in the way of that agenda, which is mostly the GOP. The risk factor for fake news is so low its almost inconsequential. When media oulets are caught in a lie they rarely even say oops anymore. Look at the recent attack on Facebook where the Washington Post claimed President Obama specifically warned the social media giant about Russia using them as a source to interfere in the 2016 election, it turns out President Obama did not mention Russia at all. The W.P. makes no appoligy but simply alters the story on line after the damage is done. Embarrassment as Washington Post corrects its 'scoop' about Obama, Facebook and Russia Back to your question as to \u201cWhy\u201d the media is biased. Journalists come from an academia that promotes liberalism and denounces conservatism and editors and program directors, are made up mostly of promoted journalists. Owners of most media sources are the uber elite liberals of George Soros stature. These people all have an overwhelming vested interest in promoting the liberal agenda, in otherwords, this is just who these people are and their bias, is a predicable pattern, that none of us should be all that suprised in.

            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t. The problem is that conservatives are much more likely to lie (see fact checking of the presidential candidates) or to push theories which have been proven untrue (global warming denial, or the Laffer Curve). Conservatives will often point to a study that shows that more reporters are liberal than conservative, but that is partially explained by the above factors. Also, when it comes to reporting, the mainstream media is usually harsher on the liberals. \u201cBut in issue-related coverage of Clinton, an overwhelming 84 percent was negative in tone, the study found, compared with 43 percent for Trump, 32 percent for Cruz and just 17 percent for Sanders.\u201d\u2014Study: Trump boosted, Clinton hurt by primary media coverage \u201cClinton has not only been hammered by the most negative coverage but the media also wrote the smallest proportion of positive stories about her, reports Crimson Hexagon, a social media software analytics company based out of Boston.\u201d\u2014Study: Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump, gets the most negative media coverage ",
