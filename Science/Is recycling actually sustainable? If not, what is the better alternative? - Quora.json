So, yes, absolutely sustainable, and in fact it\u2019s the moral choice. We should try to create no waste. Everything should be composted, reused, refined into new product, etc. Some of this is easy. Metals like steel and aluminum are easily melted down. Other items can have their recycling subsidized by not having to pay tipping fees into landfills. Gathering these clean low-value recycling items will cause some smart entrepreneurs to figure out productive uses. ",

Maintaining and improving our lives depends on new technologies. We\u2019re not going to go back to the old days because the easily reachable ores are gone anyways. (unless you like a low population and a hunter-gatherer society with no Social Security) ",
