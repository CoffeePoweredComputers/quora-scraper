            "answer_text": "A mole is a unit of measurement. One mole equals 6 x 10^23 atoms/molecules/whatever. So take the molecular mass of elemental oxygen - 16 grams per mole. Then convert from moles to grams: 1 mole elemental oxygen(16 grams O/1 mole) = 16 grams. Pretty basic question. Now if it was atmospheric oxygen O2 then it would be different because you would have two moles of oxygen which is 32 grams. Setup meetings with your chem teacher on google calendar to do practice problems that helps a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "You have it backwards. Chemists first figured out weight of oxygen is 8 times the weight of hydrogen in water by electrolyzing water. Then it was figured out there are two hydrogens per water so hydrogen was assigned the molecular weight of 1. Oxygen was 16 times that so it became 16. A mole got defined as the number of particles in 1g of elemental hydrogen. It is a man-made number, no significance in nature. (2g hydrogen in gaseous form due to H2, rather than H) Oxygen hangs out as O2 so, it is assigned 16*2=32. All of it comes from H2O (water) ratios and 1 gram. ",
