            "answer_text": "Here is a glossary of food prep and cooking methods that you may find helpful :) FOOD PREP TECHNIQUES Beating \u2013 What you do to eggs before you cook them scrambled  Chopping \u2013 Cutting food into small, equal sized pieces  Creaming \u2013 Softening butter into a smooth substance and then mixing it with other ingredients  Crimping \u2013 Pressing or pinching into small folds or ridges like is done with pie crust  Deboning \u2013 Taking the bones out of meat  De-seeding \u2013 Taking seeds out of fruits and vegetables  Dicing \u2013 Chopping into tiny squares  Filleting \u2013 Slicing thin like is done with fish  Glazing \u2013 Pouring sauce on meat or other foods to add flavor and a glaze to it  Grating \u2013 Using a grater to chop down veggies  Measuring dry ingredients \u2013 Using measuring cups or spoons to measure dry ingredients like flour or sugar  Measuring liquid ingredients \u2013 Using special measuring cups for liquids to measure liquid ingredients  Mincing \u2013 Chopping into teeny tiny pieces, typically done for ginger, garlic, and chilies  Peeling \u2013 Removing the skin from vegetables  Rinsing \u2013 Washing and rubbing vegetables under cold running water to remove dirt and germs  Rolling \u2013 Using a rolling pin to flatten dough  Shredding \u2013 Like grating vegetables but into bigger, longer pieces  Skinning \u2013 Removing the skin from meat  Slicing \u2013 Cutting with a knife into thin slices  Tenderizing \u2013 Pounding meat with a hammer to break down the muscle and make it tender (so it cooks faster)  Trimming \u2013 Removing any inedible or damaged parts of food before using it  Zesting \u2013 Grating the skin of vegetables like lemons or oranges (generally citrus fruits)  COOKING METHODS Dry heat cooking Dry heat cooking involves cooking something in an oven or over an open flame. It uses hot air to conduct heat, typically at 300\u00b0F or higher. This method of cooking browns the exterior of food adding delicious flavor (think crispy chicken skin and crusty bread). Methods of dry heat cooking include: Baking \u2013 Dry cooking foods that initially lack structure, then become solid during cooking (think cakes and muffins) Roasting \u2013 Dry cooking foods that already have a solid structure before the cooking begins (think meat and vegetables) Barbecuing \u2013 Cooking meat, fish, or other food outdoors on a rack over an open fire at low temperatures for a long timeGrilling \u2013 Similar to barbecuing, it\u2019s cooking food on a rack over an open fire, or on a grill pan, but at high temperatures for a short period of timeBroiling \u2013 Grilling is called broiling when the heat source comes from aboveRotisserie \u2013 Roasting where meat is skewered and rotated over an open flame or in an ovenSearing \u2013 Cooking the surface of food at high temperatures until a browned crust formsMoist heat cooking Moist heat cooking involves cooking with moisture \u2013 whether it\u2019s steam, water, stock, wine, or other liquid. Compared to dry heat cooking, moist heat cooking is done at much lower temperatures, anywhere from 140\u00b0F to a maximum of 212\u00b0F, because water doesn\u2019t get any hotter than that. Methods of moist heat cooking include: Boiling \u2013 Cooking with liquids around their boiling point Boiling \u2013 Cooking food in boiling liquidBlanching \u2013 Scalding food (usually fruits or vegetables) in boiling water, removing it after a brief time, then plunging it into ice water to halt the cooking processPoaching \u2013 Submerging food in warm liquid, such as water, milk, stock, or wine. It\u2019s different from other moist heating techniques in that it uses relatively low temperature.Pressure cooking \u2013 Cooking food in a pressure cooker using water or other liquid. It simulates the effects of long braising in shorter time.Simmering\u2013 Heating food in water kept just below the boiling pointSteaming \u2013 Cooking food using the steam from boiling waterSteeping \u2013 Soaking solid food in liquid to extract flavors or soften itStewing \u2013 Cooking solid food in liquid and serving the resulting gravyFrying \u2013 Cooking food in oil or other fat Deep frying \u2013 Cooking food by completely submerging it in hot oil or fatPan frying \u2013 Frying on a pan with just enough oil to coat the panSaut\u00e9ing \u2013 Pan frying food (that is cut into smaller pieces) quickly and at higher temperaturesOther techniques Basting \u2013 Cooking meat either in its own juices or in a sauce or marinade. The meat is left to cook, then periodically coated with the juice.Braising \u2013 A combination of both dry and wet cooking: the food is first seared at high temperatures, then finished in a covered pot at lower temperatures in liquidSmoking \u2013 Flavoring, browning, or cooking food by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood",

            "answer_text": "Poaching eggs: Put a mason jar lid at the bottom of the pot, deposit egg into it. Making pastry: Freeze butter, then grate. Large pieces for brisee, small ones for choux. Proofing dough: Always use a wet towel instead of plastic wrap. Yeast acts more quickly in a humid environment.  Always place a baking stone at the bottom of your oven, even if you're not using it. It draws hot air and helps keep the temperature stable even if you open the oven door.  Bread: Always test your yeast before you use it by mixing it in a solution of 3 parts warm water, one part sugar. One teaspoon of yeast to about 250 ml of solution should yield a bowl covered in thick foam after five minutes. If this isn't happening, your yeast is not optimal. Deglazing: Use beer diluted with club soda or weak lemon juice. This prevents the taste of the solvent from overpowering the fond. Alternately, use XO sauce diluted with water (this is what I do). Chocolate: Use a double boiler and candy thermometer. Microwaving or melting over direct heat can easily result in the chocolate seizing. Sauteing: Avoid using butter; it will burn at the temperatures required for a proper saute. If you must have the flavor of butter, clarify it first. Deep-frying: Safflower oil. Results in the cleanest and lightest and taste and the oil does not overpower the flavor of whatever it is you're deep frying. Cookies: Refrigerate dough for a night, preferably two. This allows flavor to develop more, resulting in a richer taste. Sauteing again: Heat the pan to desired temperature, THEN add oil. This prevents loose particles in the oil from burning and affecting the taste. Also, for a typical saute pan or skillet, use only 1-2 tablespoons fat to saute (enough to simply grease the pan without any pooling at the bottom. This helps develop fond. Bread again: When a recipe calls for hot or warm water to be added to a sifted mixture of flour, make sure it is no hotter than 50 degrees C and no cooler than 40 degrees C. This range is optimal because warmer water will aid in the development of gluten without reaching the temperature at which yeast dies. Pan sauces: When making pan sauces from vegetable fond, add a bit of mustard seed to aid in thickening. Fond produced from vegetables has little protein and will not thicken unless either starch or mustard seed are added. Mustard seed is better because starch dampens flavor too much. Burgers: Make sure your cut of beef is no more than 85% lean. If your meat appears too lean, add unclarified, raw pork fat (NOT lard). Spread the meat on a surface and pat it dry first. Then,mix your meat with a bit of egg and bread as well. These two things keep the burger from falling apart on the grill or expanding too much from steam as it cooks.  Fries: Let potatoes sit in cool water for about half an hour, or quickly blanche them before frying. This removes starch and helps keep the fries crispier for longer. Make sure you accurately measure temp when making fries. Optimal oil temp should be around 190 degrees C. Any lower and the fries will absorb too much oil, making them soggy and nasty. If you lack a deep fryer, use a thick bottomed pan to prevent temperature from dropping too much as you deposit potatoes into the oil. ",
