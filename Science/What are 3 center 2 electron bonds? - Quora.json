            "answer_text": "they are bonds joining three atoms together but using only two electrons. The bonding pair jumps back and forth between the two pairs of atoms holding all three together by resonance (lewis model) or, using MO theory, they are two electrons in an MO that spans three atoms. Either way, they are not quite enough electrons to form two strong bonds so the effect is that the bonds are not very strong. Here is a slide from my lecture set on Lewis Dot Structures.  ",
