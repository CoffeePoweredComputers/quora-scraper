            "answer_text": "That is an interesting question. The best answer I have yet come across is the following copy/paste:- \u201c*** w01 11/15 p. 27 Questions From Readers *** Questions From Readers How did the serpent in the garden of Eden convey to Eve the idea to break God\u2019s law regarding the tree of the knowledge of good and bad? Genesis 3:1 states: \u201cNow the serpent proved to be the most cautious of all the wild beasts of the field that Jehovah God had made. So it began to say to the woman: \u2018Is it really so that God said you must not eat from every tree of the garden?\u2019\u201d There have been various suggestions as to how the serpent might have communicated with Eve. One idea is that it did so through body language or gestures. For example, English cleric Joseph Benson commented: \u201cIt seems most likely that it was by signs of some kind. Some, indeed, have supposed that reason and speech were then the known properties of serpents, . . . but of this there is no proof.\u201d By using mere body language, however, how could the serpent communicate to Eve the idea that by partaking of the forbidden fruit she would become like God, able to decide what was good and what was bad? Furthermore, Eve participated in the conversation, answering the question raised by the serpent. (Genesis 3:2-5) The view that the serpent communicated only with signs or movements would lead to the conclusion that Eve replied by using gestures, whereas the Bible says that she spoke. Referring to this incident, the apostle Paul warned fellow Christians: \u201cI am afraid that somehow, as the serpent seduced Eve by its cunning, your minds might be corrupted.\u201d The danger Paul spoke of came from \u201cfalse apostles, deceitful workers.\u201d The threat that such \u201csuperfine apostles\u201d presented was not confined to body language and gestures. It included their speech\u2014their cunning words, spoken to mislead others.\u20142 Corinthians 11:3-5, 13. Although speech was used to misguide Eve in the garden of Eden, there is nothing to suggest that the literal serpent had vocal cords. It actually did not need them. When God\u2019s angel spoke to Balaam through a she-ass, the animal did not need a complex voice box similar to that of a human. (Numbers 22:26-31) Obviously, when this \u2018voiceless beast of burden made utterance with the voice of a man,\u2019 the power for the action came from the spirit realm.\u20142 Peter 2:16. The spirit creature behind the serpent that spoke to Eve is identified in the Bible as \u201cthe original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan.\u201d (Revelation 12:9) The audible words that Eve heard and responded to came at the instigation of Satan, who \u201ckeeps transforming himself into an angel of light.\u201d\u20142 Corinthians 11:14.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Question: How did the snake in the Bible \"talk\" to Eve? The scribes wanted to tell interesting stories so they mentioned talking snake and talking donkey Many verses cannot be divinely inspired because they are contradicting the basic wisdom taught by Jesus and by the prophets. It is not an accepted proof to refer to 2 Timothy 3:16 to claim that \u201cAll Scripture is inspired by God\u201d That claim was written by Paul to add some credibility to his letters after the disciples denied him and deserted him. Other reason to reject the claim of Paul in 2 Timothy 3:16 is that the letters of Paul were written before Mark, Matthew, Luke, John and revelation; we cannot say \u201cthe book of Revelation is inspired by God because Paul said so\u201d. We cannot say \u201cthe bible is inspired by God because the bible said so\u201d; that is not a logically accepted argument and is a clear \u2018Circular reasoning\u2019. Prophets did not teach that God has preserved the holy book; they have advised that there will be changes and have been warned of such additions and deletions. Amos 8:11-12 teach that People will be thirsty for the true word of God but they will not find it anywhere Psalm 56:5 teaches All day long they twist my words Jeremiah 8:8 teaches the lying pen of the scribes has distorted the word of God Jeremiah 5:30-31 teach that the priests have distorted the religion teachings and that the people love those distorted teachings Instead of the true teaching \u2018You shall not murder \u2018in Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17 The scribes who glorify defeating their enemies ignored the true teaching and added some verses to justify the killing like Exodus 23:23, Numbers 31:16-18, Joshua 6:20-21, Judges 15:14-16 and Judges 16:30 Instead of \u2018Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more\u2019 in Isaiah 2:4, they have justified atrocities. Instead of the true and most consistent teachings of \u2018blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 in Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 28, Deuteronomy 11:26-28, Deuteronomy 4:40, Deuteronomy 6:24-25, Deuteronomy 7:12-15, and Deuteronomy 8, they teach that God has chosen them regardless of their obedience as in the distorted teachings of Deuteronomy 9:5-6 and Deuteronomy 7:6-8 Instead of the true and strict teachings of Jesus in Matthew 7:21-27, Luke 13:25-27, Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Matthew 25:35-45, Mark 12:28-34, Mark 10:17-19, Matthew 19:16-19, Luke 18:18-20, Luke 6:46-48, John 14:15 and John 14:21 most Christian scholars teach the distorted and attractive teachings like Romans 8:30, 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Ephesians 2:5, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16, Colossians 2:14 and Ephesians 1:4 When Jacob\u2019s descendants wanted to glorify him, they claimed that he wrestled with God and was saved. The verses in Genesis 32:24-30 teach that Jacob was able to wrestle with God; he said to God \"I will not let you go unless you bless me\u201d Although the true teachings of Deuteronomy 10:17 teach that God does not favor \u2018who shows no partiality\u2019, the descendants of Jacob wanted to glorify him in the name of God; they added the distorted teaching of Genesis 25:23 and Malachi 1:2-3 \u201cJacob I loved, but Esau I hated\u201d They wanted to say that it is the will of God to choose them regardless of any condition like good work and true faith. That distorted teaching is against the true teachings of Moses that God chooses the righteous who obey and curse the wicked as the core and the most consistent teachings of Exodus 19:5, Leviticus 18:4-5, Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 11:18-20, 11:26-28 , Deuteronomy 28, Deuteronomy 30:15-16 , and Deuteronomy 30:19, Deuteronomy 32:46-47 Deuteronomy 30:11-14 teach that obedience is possible; the verses have been copied into Romans 10:5-9 in order to change the salvation by obedience into the salvation by faith alone Some teachers teach that obedience is not possible; they do not teach Deuteronomy 30:11-14 anymore; they teach the distorted teachings which teach that obedience is not possible like Romans 7:14-25, Romans 10:5-9 and Galatians 3:10 The original verses of Deuteronomy 30:11-14 are: Now what I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach. It is not up in heaven, so that you have to ask, \u201cWho will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?\u201d Nor is it beyond the sea, so that you have to ask, \u201cWho will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it?\u201d No, the word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it The distorted verses of Romans 10:5-9 are: Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on the law shall live by it. But the righteousness based on faith says, \"Do not say in your heart, Who will ascend into heaven?\" (that is, to bring Christ down) or \"Who will descend in the abyss?\" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). But what does it say? The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart (that is, the word of faith which we preach); because if you confess with your lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved The reason of the change is to shift the faith foundations from obedience, repentance, and good deeds into claims of faith without good works or obedience to God\u2019s law Romans 7:19 teaches For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do--this I keep on doing James has corrected that misunderstanding in James 4:17 If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it, it is sin for him Instead of the true and most consistent teachings of \u2018blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 in Deuteronomy 28, Leviticus 18:4-5, Deuteronomy 11:18-20, 11:26-28 , Deuteronomy 32:46-47, Deuteronomy 30:15-16 , and Deuteronomy 30:19, some teachers teach that God chooses people regardless of their obedience as in the distorted teachings of Deuteronomy 9:5-6 and Deuteronomy 7:6, Malachi 1:2, Romans 9:13 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Atonement they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:11 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who did not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teaches that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without a blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teaches that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood Proverbs 17:15 states: \u2018He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination unto God\u2019 That should be considered as a warning to the teachers who promise free salvation to the sinners and who teach that the innocent has been punished on behalf of the sinners Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main prerequisites for salvation That is the core Christianity teaching as taught in Matthew 7:21 Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven Jesus has confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony \u2018in repentance and obedience is your salvation\u2019 as taught in Isaiah 30:15 In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved Salvation is not based solely on belief and nothing else; salvation is not granted to those who merely profess acceptance of Jesus without performing kind or compassionate deeds Jesus did not teach that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation But unless you repent, you too will all perish Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u2018For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u2019 That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance \u2018I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\u2019. Jesus did not ask the disciples to worship him as a God; he asked them to pray to \u201cthe only true God\u201d, \u201cMy God and your God\u201d. The bible footnotes show many other additions in King James Version which were added to support the claims of the trinity and which were not in the old scripture; examples are: In I John 4:3 \u2018CHRIST is come in the flesh\u2019 is an addition In Matthew 8:2, 9:18, 15:25, 18:26, 20:20, Mark 5:6 the word \u2018bow down' was changed to \u2018worshiped\u2019. Jesus referred to himself as \u201cson of man\u201d. Jesus was not all-knowledgeable and he prayed to GOD, so this is enough to say that he wasn\u2019t God nor did God come down to earth to be Jesus. Jesus said, \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know You the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.\u201d John 17:3 Jesus said that he does not know everything; he said that only God knows But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father Mark 13:32 Jesus said that he is not equal to God \u201cI can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.\u201d John 5:30 Jesus said, \u201cThe Father is greater than I.\u201d John 14:28 \u201cJesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\u201d John 7:16 Jesus prayed to God as written in Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, John 17:11, Matthew 26:39, Luke 10:21, Luke 22:44 \u201cmy Father and your Father; my God and your God\u201d John 20:17 The disciples did not pray to Jesus, they prayed to the God and Father of Jesus \u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d 1 Peter 1:3 Jesus introduced himself as a Prophet and people accepted him as a prophet, not as a God in Matthew 13:57, John 9:17, Matthew 21:11, Luke 7:16, Luke 24:19, John 6:14, Matthew 14:5, Matthew 21:46, John 7:40-41, and in Matthew 24:36 Jesus never said I am God; In the Old Testimony God says he is God several times, but Jesus did not say so in the New Testimony Isaiah 45:5 and 46:9 \u2018no God beside me\u2019, \u2018none like me\u2019 In John 17:6-8 and John 13:3 Jesus explained that God has given power and authority, he did not own it \u201cI have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word. \u201cNow they have come to know that everything You have given Me is from You; for the words which You gave Me I have given to them; and they received them and truly understood that I came forth from You, and they believed that You sent Me John 12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say John 14:24 Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. These words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me In Matthew 19:16-17 and Luke 18:19 Jesus denied being good in the sense that God is good. \u2018Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.\u2019 Jesus is called a \u201cMan\u201d many times in the Bible of John 8:40, Acts 17:31, Matthew 27:54, Luke 23:47, Mark 15:39 \u2018a man who has told you the truth\u2019 The disciples have introduced Jesus as a \u201cMan\u201d in Acts 2:22 and Acts 2:23 *reincarnation Prophets have taught that there is no such thing as beforelife or reincarnation. That is according to the teachings of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. There is no such thing as nonexistence; death is the end of the temporary testing stage When we see birth defects or children starving to death, we cannot accept the reincarnation teachings that the children who are suffering were sinful in their previous lives. God has told us that we are born fresh without any previous knowledge; those who claim to remember previous lives must be mistaken. According to the teachings of Christianity and Islam, we will be judged in the afterlife according to our deeds in this life. How those who believe in reincarnation explain population growth? Reincarnation was a wise answer about the issue of suffering; here is the general answer as taught by prophets: We are here for testing; test environment necessitates struggle between good and evil. Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. The wealthy father has the right to test his sons before distributing the wealth The wise father disciplines his children and prepares them for a better life The obedient son who takes care of others should be rewarded better than the disobedient son who persecutes others. Regardless of how successful we are with our personal objectives; we cannot have inner peace without addressing the high-level objective; the purpose of our existence. It is wrong to say \u2018let us enjoy the journey and forget about the destination\u2019 If you find yourself in a train, you should not enjoy the beautiful scenes before first ask: why am I here? Where is the destination? We should first ask \u2018what is the purpose of life?\u2019 What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day... for the un-examined life is not worth living \u2013 Socrates Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-... We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. Exams also urge students to get prepared in order to succeed Students should not wonder about the intention of the teacher; they are supposed to focus on what the teacher asked them to do If God wants to set up the testing environment to test people, then we are not supposed to advise God on how to set up the terms and conditions of the testing. The students are not supposed to advise the teacher on how to prepare the exams. God has created us, and he knows how to test us. The testing questions and answers are not supposed to be disclosed before the exam; testing environment necessitates some doubts and enables different choices and different decisions. The test does not depend on the level of education, a child may say \u2018I do not see the plane any more, it is going far away, it is still there but my sight does not reach it; God must be there but my sight does not reach him\u2019, but a scientist might conclude that, \u2018I do not see God, then there is no God\u2019. The test does not depend on the level of religion education, maybe someone who never heard of the religion teachings could pass the test based on the natural original gifts of conscience and reason \u2018What I do not want done to myself, I will not do to others. We may find some scholars who know the religion teachings but they accept to persecute and torture others, those are the bad trees which the prophets have warned us of them and of their bad fruits. The wise teacher sets different evaluation criteria for different grades; the students in the first grade are not evaluated as the students in the advanced degrees. We expect that the fair and wise God would evaluate people according to what they have been provided. The person who never heard of Prophets would have an easier test based on the gift of intelligence and conscience; he might get rewards for his good works and he might not be punished if not wicked. God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. For those who have doubts, they can ask God. All prophets have urged us to ask God and taught that God would answer us. Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us.

            "answer_text": "Read Revelation 12:9 and Revelation 20:2. I will put them down below: \u201cAnd the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\u201d -Rev. 12:9. \u201cAnd he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years.\u201d -Rev. 20:2. There may be a couple of other Revelation verses that cite this, but these are 2 main ones I can name at the top of my head. Anyways, we know from these verses that Satan was the snake that tempted Eve in Genesis 3. Satan made himself a snake. That\u2019s why. Another attacked part of the Bible is Balaam\u2019s Donkey in Numbers 22. How can a donkey talk? Read Num. 22:28: \u201cAnd the Lord opened the mouth of the ass(donkey), and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?\u201d So why did the donkey talk? Technically, it didn\u2019t. God spoke through the donkey to get Balaam\u2019s attention, see verse 31. If an animal talks, it\u2019s an angelic being(Satan is an angel-see 2 Corinthians 11:14) speaking through it to get someone\u2019s attention. It\u2019s not the animal itself speaking. More on that attention thing, read this passage from Revelation: \u201cAnd before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle. And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.\u201d -Revelation 4:6\u20138. These bizarre creatures, believed to be called Cherubims in deeper study, are saying that phrase non-stop. We are then told in verses 9\u201311: \u201cAnd when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.\u201d So we can see here that the 4 living creatures chanting about the Holiness and Return of Jesus attracts 420 elders who praise God themselves. These talking animals with multiple eyes and wings make 420 elders pay attention and also worship God. Just like the snake and donkey got Eve and Balaam\u2019s attention, respectively. Sorry that was long, but I hope that helped you out! The verses I did not write out can be Googled or looked up in a Bible. ",

The word has several different meanings and was used to describe a sorcerer, magician, deceiver etc. The \u201cSerpent\u201d in the garden of Eden was not a snake. It was a metaphor for something else. The Serpent is also referred to in the Book of Revelation as the Devil. The \u201cSerpent\u201d was believed to be a pre-historic man-like being that was able to communicate. Satan, a spirit being, entered the Serpent and seduced Eve to commit evil. The sin was not the eating of an apple or fruit. Fruit was a metaphor for something else, i.e. sin of a sexual nature. There are commentaries about this by Jewish Rabbis in the 5th and 9th century Midrash and Kabbalah. ",

Most of us only accept what we can verify through life experience and if we haven\u2019t had an animal communicate with us we will be unlikely to accept it. But when the world was new and our minds uncomplicated by centuries of genetic breakdown perhaps our brain had a greater ability to communicate by means other than speaking out loud. Was this \u2018subtle\u2019 beast the only one of its kind? Was it an extraordinary example of those days or was it common to have some kind of conversation with animals?
