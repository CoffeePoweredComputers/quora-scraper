            "answer_text": "There are weapons that could annihilate, and have. I detailed this in my FIRST CONTACT book, but here is a recap. Around a million years ago in earth time, but only 100,000 or so years ago in universal time, Reptilians from another galaxy decided to take over this part of the galaxy for whatever minerals and assets there were. They had taken over a couple of planets before they met any resistance, as the planets are not organized, as they are now. What then occurred was a space war much worse than those that are depicted in the Star Wars movies of modern times. They didn\u2019t just blow up a planet\u2014they would destroy a sun, obliterating all of the planets in a solar system and billions of beings. People of all types lived in constant fear of being destroyed for thousands of years. Because these other planetary societies are much farther advanced technologically than we are, at this time, they had learned to \u201cportal hop,\u201d using energetic pathways between planets, stars, and galaxies. These portals had to be guarded. We have an example of what happened close by Earth. Here is a photo, taken by NASA and enlarged of a spaceship that crashed on the back side of our moon, when they encountered a Reptilian ship.  To make a long story short, everyone is now at peace. The Reptilians prey on other galaxies, not ours. You can read how they came to peace in my book. You can read a couple of sample chapters on my website www.thegentlewaybook.com , and click on Sample Chapters. I also have a weekly free newsletter that you can check out and possibly subscribe to. I am in constant contact with my \u201cbrother on another planet,\u201d and continually ask questions sent to me from all over the world. Here is a link to the latest one.

            "answer_text": "You are assuming that they would actually travel those enormous distances in some sort of vehicle. Modern mathematics now postulates the existence of more dimensions than our own. Spiritual masters talk about leaving their bodies and maneuvering long distances out of their physical bodies. Einstein theorized about worm holes connecting far places by connecting bent space. Consider that some alien culture a million years ahead of our own might understand how consciousness can be moved about from one physical space to a different physical space. Think that's absurd, consider that two \u201centangled\u201d particles that are physically separated to opposite ends of the universe will duplicate each others actions with no connection. Entanglement has been proven in the quantum arena. Quantum physics has know for 100 years that light will active either asa a particle or a wave depending on whether it is being measured. Its just light, how does it know? My point is that an alien race might simply think to come here in some non-physical mode and reconstitute themselves into a physical form. Then again, don\u2019t you hope that if they could do that, that they would be advance enough to not want or need to conquer us. Perhaps even if they could destroy us, they might find it more prudent to watch and help us develop our evolution to a more gentle future. Yet still, maybe they are just waiting until dawn tomorrow to push the button that clears out the earth for their new intergalactic highway! ",
