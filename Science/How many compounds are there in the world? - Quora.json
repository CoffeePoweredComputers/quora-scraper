Theoretically, there are an infinite possible combinations of elements to form compounds and hence this question cannot be answered figuratively. Large no. Of compounds have been made, is made and will continue to be made and hence a figurative answer is impossible. The answer to your question would be infinity or uncountable ",

There are only a few letters of the alphabet yet when combined form thousands of words. In like manner,millions of compounds are formed using a a hundred elements and compounds also are created by mixing two or more compounds . ",
