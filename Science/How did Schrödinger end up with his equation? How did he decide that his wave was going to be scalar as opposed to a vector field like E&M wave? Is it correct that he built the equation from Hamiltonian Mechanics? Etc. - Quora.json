            "answer_text": "The easiest way to find out the answers to your questions is to look at what Schroedinger wrote about it himself http://web.archive.org/web/20081217040121/http://home.tiscali.nl/physis/HistoricPaper/Schroedinger/Schroedinger1926c.pdf As I understand it, Schroedinger was not basing his work on an analogy to Hamiltonian mechanics, but on an analogy to Hamilton's principle.  This is the idea that there is a duality between the wave description of light and the ray description in geometric optics, i.e. light rays travel perpendicularly to the crests of waves.  Hamilton had shown that this duality could be extended to mechanics if we look at solutions of Newton's equations with a fixed energy, so Newtonian mechanics could, in some sense, be described as a theory of waves as well.  This idea was extremely influential on de Broglie, so Schroedinger probably learned about this idea from de Broglie's papers. One has to be a bit careful when the name \"Hamilton\" comes up in this context.  Most modern day physicists only know Hamilton for Hamiltonian mechanics so they tend to assume that this is what is being referred to when the name Hamilton comes up.  In fact, Hamilton also worked on a variety of other approaches to classical mechanics, including Lagrangian mechanics and Hamilton-Jacobi theory. To answer question 4, Schroedinger thought that there may be a solution to his equation describing a reasonably-well localized wavepacket that does not spread out over time.  This could then be used to describe a particle, if we think of the wave as representing charge density.  Schroedinger showed how this would work for a harmonic oscillator, leading to the notion of what we now call a \"coherent state\", which has turned out to be important in quantum optics.  Unfortunately, this idea does not work for more realistic Hamiltonians, for which we can show that wavefunctions will always spread.  However, there is an even worse problem than this, which is that the wavefunction is defined on configuration space rather than 3d space.  This is responsible for entanglement and means that the wavefunction cannot be thought of as simply some sort of density in space.  Both of these issues were known to Schroedinger when he eventually switched to Born's interpretation. ",

            "answer_text": "Jay Wacker's answer is very good.  For those who don't want, or can't handle, the math - and also, for those who believe in fields, not particles, here's how I answered the question in my book (see Understand Physics Through Quantum Field Theory). After describing de Broglie's work, I wrote: The only story left to tell is about the equations that govern the matter fields. These equations describe how the field intensity at one point is related to the intensity at another point and thus how the field propagates through space... While the young de Broglie was serving France in the Eiffel Tower, an Austrian physicist named Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger was serving on the other side as an artillery officer on the Italian front, where he was cited for outstanding service in battle. These two war-time enemies were destined to become close friends and allies in creating the new physics known as wave mechanics, which eventually led to QFT. After the war Schr\u00f6dinger wound up at Zurich, where Einstein had developed his theory of relativity. In 1927 he took over the Max Planck chair at the University of Berlin, where he remained until Hitler came to power.[1] Schr\u00f6dinger learned of de Broglie\u2019s work by reading a footnote in a paper by Einstein. Even before the experimental confirmation, he realized its significance and wrote excitingly to Einstein: I have been intensely concerned these days with Louis de Broglie's ingenious theory. It is extraordinarily exciting, but still has some very grave difficulties. \u2013 E. Schr\u00f6dinger  Later, while Schr\u00f6dinger was giving a seminar, a student asked him why there was no equation to show how de Broglie\u2019s waves change with time, as there was for EM waves. Schr\u00f6dinger got to work and in two weeks found his now-famous equation, which he published in 1926. With a field equation in hand, Schr\u00f6dinger did not see any need for an accompanying particle, as did de Broglie. To Schr\u00f6dinger the electron was a field and only a field.  Another field with mass. Like the equations for the strong and weak fields, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s equation for the electron contains a mass term that slows down the propagation of changes in the field. Without the mass term, matter fields would travel at the speed of light, like the photon; with the mass term they propagate more slowly - in fact, like a particle of mass m. Another effect of mass is to increase the fre\u00adquency of oscillation, which you may recall is related to energy. In fact, this relation between mass and energy leads directly to the most famous equation in physics, as we will see in Chapter 7. And spin. Like the gravitational field (spin 2) and the EM and weak fields (spin 1), the electron field has a spin and, as we saw above, its spin is \u00bd. It was this spin that prevented Schr\u00f6dinger from using the Klein-Gordon equation (see \u201cOskar Klein\u201d in Chap. 5). The question of how to introduce spin \u00bd into the field equations was not an easy one. It was finally solved by a young English physicist named Paul Dirac...  [1] Schr\u00f6dinger, a Catholic, would not live in a country in which persecution of Jews became national policy. He eventually settled at the newly-created Institute of Advanced Studies in Dublin. \u201cHe did it, and we admired him. For it is no small matter to be uprooted in one\u2019s middle age, and to live in a foreign land. But he would have it no other way.\u201d \u2013 Max Born ",
