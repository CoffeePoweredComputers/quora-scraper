            "answer_text": "I advise you to stop thinking in terms of \u201chigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d wavelength. Wavelength is short or long. \u201cHigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d can apply to frequency but those terms lose meaning with wavelength. Light has three properties are irrevocably tied together. Energy, wavelength, and frequency. As light interacts with matter, it loses energy. Consequently the wavelength lengthens and frequency reduces. Absorbed light has had its energy absorbed, so there is no remaining energy, wavelength, or frequency. The energy it deposited into a material may be warmer, causing re-emission of infrared light, which is relatively low energy, long wavelength, and low frequency. It may help to think of conservation of energy. Light cannot become more energetic, with the exception the Doppler effect which has no bearing on this discussion. If light strikes something, it loses some or all of its energy. Because energy is tied to wavelength and frequency, light can only reduce/lower in energy, lengthen in wavelength, and reduce/slow/lower in frequency. ",

            "answer_text": "You might be referring to fluorescence or to solar heating. In fluorescence, light is absorbed in phosphors. This excites electrons to some upper level, but on the way down to a lower level, the electron may emit several photons. Some of the energy may simply be absorbed as heat. You are likely to see some photons come out at longer wavelengths.  Violet laser beam fluorescing as blue or yellow depending on the phosphor. In solar absorption, a black object may absorb sunlight, mostly in the visible range, but emit infrared light in the infrared. This is because it never gets hot enough to emit visible light. ",
