            "answer_text": "Using oxygen bleach is an effective way to warp off algae from surfaces. It's safe and non toxic to you and environment. If you are going to do it on walls, this will keep your beautiful wall designs and coatings safe. Algal species are susceptible to acidic conditions so you can use mild acids like vinegar. You can sprinkle on the algal deposits and clear them off by scrubbing in a circular motion followed by a water wash. This works really good and comparatively, cheaper than other methods available. P.S Scrubbing is mandatory in all methods to avoid regrowth and to remove stains. ",
