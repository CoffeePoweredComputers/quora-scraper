            "answer_text": "I don't know why it would be desirable. The closest analogy I can draw is to objective space, such as space that permits motion without change in perspective. I have attempted this with my own perception, and sometimes for brief moments attained what I call 'isometric travel'. Perhaps this is possible with real space as well, and not just perception. I will describe my experience for your interest. I had the experience of walking along a path next to a row of trees, and perceiving that the size of each tree remained the same in my vision, between one moment and the next. However, in my larger vision, I started to see the world in terms of a view from above, in which the world was composed of modular units which could be defined in terms of their complexity, or some other value. The perspective of the local world stayed isometric, but the larger world became conceptual and almost grayed-out. I can imagine the next step would be to make large leaps between conceptual frameworks and points of motion, but in such a limited world this was impossible. I gained the idea that beauty was in some sense the value of the world that I knew. The world was reduced to a coincidentally useful absurdity. The trouble I had with isometric travel I attributed to the passing of time. It was as if the cosmic editor was critical of me. And I wasn't sure if isometric travel was the same thing as immortality, so it began to seem like a specialized tool that was too difficult to simulate to mean anything. But surely, combining this with some other application would almost certainly result in access to some other dimension! One question to raise is whether space-time is a matter of perception, a formalism, or a product of energy, for example. If it is a formalism, the formalism might be changed to an isometric type. However, with products of energy it would be more difficult. And, with perception, it would depend on each individual's preferences. As for me, I don't know why it would be one over another. If it is actually TRUE that it is not one versus another, it's just a matter of proving what is already there. Perhaps isometric perception is a latent effect which technically exists on some variable / variabilistic dimension of space-time already. As for the case in which it does not involves isometric travel, I'm not sure. Good luck, in any case! ",
