This dossier contains information I have on file from my time in Federal Service, but no secret information is included, I would have no way to access it anyway. I have been asked for my credentials. I am a former member of the USDOJ OLE who trained AUSA and other Federal employees in a wide range of skills needed to do their jobs. My stint there continued through the war on terror. I am also a researcher and fixer for the movie industry, a writer, and a former deputy Sheriff. I am a conservative Republican.  How it Started In 2013 Russia, in discussions with other powers opposing the United States, a list that includes Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (but not including China whose efforts are unrelated) Developed a rough plan to destabilize the United States and remove it from the international playing field. We now know that the following issues were presented: The United States had a large disloyal opposition.Politicians representing that disloyal opposition were notably weakRacism related to the election of a Black president was on the rise.The education level of Americans in general was dropping.American social media was ripe for certain classes of information warfare.The American militia movement was notably anti-American and could be called the American Taliban in terms of its outlook and willingness to take action against American democratic institutions.The collective choice of this group, although pursued individually, was to in essence blow the doors off of good government in the USA and seek the election of sympathetic politicians willing to subvert American interests for personal temporal power.  Taking Russia as an exemplar, Vladimir Putin personally felt that the presidents from Reagan to Obama were a key problem in that all of them, even the denigrated Bush, were effective world leaders and strong in domestic policy. At the time Putin was torn between throwing the Russian weight behind the Democrat or Republican party, but a survey of the Republican party was published that made the rounds of Russian news outlets because of its irony - most Republicans surveyed said they would rather live in a fascist state than a free democracy where people of color had the same rights as them. The die was cast and Russia started a massive intelligence operation that would come close to destroying American democracy and change the fate of our nation, and may still see the end of the American experiment.   TheheadquartersoftheMainDirectorateoftheGeneralStaffoftheArmedForcesoftheRussianFederation,theG.R.U.(above).TheheadquartersoftheMainDirectorateoftheGeneralStaffoftheArmedForcesoftheRussianFederation,theG.R.U.(above). The main players in this operation were drawn from across the Russian intelligence world. The Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (G.R.U) is normally restricted to military operational intelligence, but for years has been working to improve its capacity in general espionage and cyber-warfare. The main coordination for GRU actions occurs in the the Second Directorate, whose work in in the Americas, and is closely linked to the modal operations of the the Twelfth Directorate for information warfare. 72nd Special Service Center (72SSC) is the GRU\u2019s main operational command assigned to destabilizing the United States and is sometimes called Unit 54777. 72SSC operates through funded (owned and operated) and shill fronts and have the category of employees - touts (Americans paid to betray the nation and support Trump), Robots (fake posters who are generated by computers, and False Flags, or posters who have real existence but whose background are different. OneWorld Press is a 72SSC asset tasked with feeding talking points Trump supporters, and their work can actually be seen here on Quora as comments made by this group will rapidly move through the Trump information sphere and end up either through touts (controlled accounts) or through ignorant reposters. For example, OneWorld Press claimed that the accusations about Russian intelligence\u2019s propaganda efforts were being spread by officials who aimed to hurt President Trump\u2019s re-election chances. \u201cEverybody across the world knows that some members of the \u2018deep state\u2019 have their daggers out for Trump, and the president himself has even said as much on countless occasions,\u201d it said. Four days after the was posting more than 300 identically worded posts appeared from 228 Quora accounts in hundreds of topics. Special Forces of the Main Directorate / GRU Illegals Group is assigned a mission to provide training and assistance to US Sovereign Citizen and Militia groups. Although under Trump the GRU Illegal Group has flourished using Muslim extremists to contact and radicalize US militia units, encouraging them to attack peaceful protests, the arrest of Michael R. Solomon, and Benjamin R. Teeter who were coordinating their terror activities with GRU through a Hamas cutout (who turned out to be an FBI informant) has opened up American counterintelligence possibilities and US intelligence are waiting for the change of leadership that may occur in January to take the gloves off. Militia who work with Russian operatives are called Boiskis, those who work with muslim terror groups are called Boojahideen. The Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (S.V.R.) is the follow on continuity organization that replaced the KGB. Putin, a former officer in the KGB, was key in the creation of the SVR, and the SVR is actually more effective than the KGB because many of the directorates of the KGB were not continued into the SVR organization.

A Russian organization funded by Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin as a front for SVR operations in Europe and America related to cyber-attacks. Centered in their \u201cTranslator\u201d (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0447\u0438\u043a) department, the IRA poses as various American groups to support the Trump campaign and sow confusion in the voting process. The IRA, according to the U.S. Department of Justice circular, was employing dozens of moderators on pro-Trump and running fake BLM and Antifa websites to provide \u201ccitations\u201d for those IRA employed Trump operations to use in their publishing. The Ministry of Intelligence of the Islamic Republic of Iran, formerly Sazman-e Ettela'at va Amniat-e Melli-e Iran (Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran), sometimes inaccurately called SAVAMA, but now called MISIRI. A coordinating intelligence agency with Russia, it usually works through Hamas and Hezbollah and has been found to be funding the American militia movement, causing the FBI to develop a new strategy against infiltration.

Interior Security Force of Hamas is the intelligence and security force of the Hamas movement in Gaza that ironically, considering its name, does foreign intelligence work. Extensive evidence is coming out that Hamas is involved in the Trump campaign and Militia movement, but there are significant questions about who is in the driver's seat. Musa Abu Marzouk, who heads Hamas' foreign relations wing, was recently revealed to be working for Hezbollah and be tasked to aid Iranian intelligence in their less localized more ambitious efforts against the US. Given the reluctance of Trump officials to move against right wing racist extremest, it is now apparent that Hezbollah used Hamas assets to assist the Trump campaign and provide encouragement to right wing militias to maintain and increase the violence against US protesters.

Hezbollah Intelligence is a broad name for several groups working to secure Hezbollah interests in the greater world stage. Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah has recently moved the organization from strictly opposing Israel to working in partnership with Russia and has defined the US under Obama and Bush as existential threats to their security. Destabilization efforts as early as 2016, and significant financial and cyber support for Trump. Trump Campaign we will see as this article develops how the Trump campaign has purposefully coordinated their efforts with foreign enemies and terror groups, aided those groups in getting their message into American, and benefited wittingly and unwittingly from the aid these groups provide. If it were not an organization developed to run a presidential campaign, the Trump Campaign would in essence be an unregistered foreign organization that acts to feed disinformation into the American public. I will add to this as I get time to type in notes Sources FBI probing whether emails in New York Post story about Hunter Biden are tied to Russian disinformation Washington Post: White House was warned that Giuliani was being used by Russians to 'feed misinformation' to Trump Bipartisan Senate report details Trump campaign contacts with Russia in 2016, adding to Mueller findings 93% of Black Lives Matter Protests Have Been Peaceful, New Report Finds Demonstrations & Political Violence in America: New Data for Summer 2020 Kyle Rittenhouse, Kenosha, and the Sheepdog Mentality About 93% of racial justice protests in the US have been peaceful, a new report finds White supremacists and militias have infiltrated police across US, report says Who Is \u2018Umbrella Man\u2019?

As a humorous aside, the first response to this question is a racist response: Greg Imhoff's answer to Can someone put a face on foreign interference in the United States social matrix? Note the poster is a Russian bot\u2026   Another example to parse: Ruth Miller says not true, you allow the president be called bad names, really, vile awful names but we are not allowed to say anything about Obama because he is black, we must treat black people with kids gloves or else our business is burned down, we are attacked. We name street names after black people who have raped, dopers, committed crimes and give them royal funerals, if a black person is killed there will be riots, looting etc. even if the wrong full killing is being investigated and justice will be served. But some people do not agree with it so the riots start all over again. Black people are given more rights and priviliges then any other race, yet they never stop complaining of being mistreated. What is it what they really want? Of course I am not speaking of the many many great black people who agree with me, they consider it an insult if they should be treated differently, making them feel they are not smart enough and need special help. If I were black I truly would be insulted if special treatment would be given me because I am a black person. Cant understand why some black people would not think about that. Ruth Miller who complains a double standard that blacks riot loot rape every time someone innocently lynches one of them and then they apparently in her neighborhood honor rapists with streets named after them but she has nothing against great black people who behave and keep their mouths shut and quit complaining about mistreatment, and if she were black she would be the silent \u201cgood black\u201d and not the angry black who makes trouble. Continuing her thinking is easy - those blacks never knew hour good they had it and yet they demand more and they want a president despite being a pack of dopers and racist\u2026.  Conclusion Most Americans do not know we are fighting a war. The war does not have much in the way of gunfire - Kyle Rittenhouse was an unwitting soldier in the war. But we are all fighting it. Like WW2 there are two obvious sides in this war, for America, and against America. The objectives of the enemy are simple - make us bleed. The scariest thing about the war is that our neighbors are being activated to fight against our country using a tool we thought we were immune to: lies. And that tool is sinister because it defends itself. Each time you wave the sword of truth enemy patches your accomplishment with a new layer of lies. Even worse. Since the enemy in using our neighbors as their weapons against democracy and freedom, they are putting us in a horrible position trying to figure out how we fight without hurting them. We cannot hang the tools of the enemy, they are our brothers. How do we fight this war ethically will define who we are for a generation. ",

However, as a student of geopolitics myself, it seems like you are leaving out the more recent threat of the Chinese, and their relationship with the Biden family and Congress. For Russian, now concentrating on protecting themselves, while the CCCP really believes the entire world is ready and needs their flavor of global communism. And so, don\u2019t know what to think about all your Russian information. I can only assume your experience doesn\u2019t include recent insights into China. It seems to me that Russia was trying hard to win an information war against the US, but no so much anymore. Tell me if you think they are meddling in today\u2019s US elections in any big way. In the US it\u2019s so important to block disinformation about Russian influence and get to the fact that we could accidentally elect an extremely corrupt Joe Biden and family. And unwittingly continue on with a Congress compromised by China. Even if you don\u2019t have direct experience with Chinese intelligence, I\u2019m curious if you have insights about their undeclared war on the US. ",
