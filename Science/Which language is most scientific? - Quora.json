            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s assume that you are asking about which language is better suited to describe observations or apply labels, or categorize processes and motive engines (British daemons), and simple machines. If you look at the English language, specifically, and the scientific community in general, historically they will go to the language where investigations first contained the description. I\u2019m speaking of Latin, Greek, and German \u2018root words\u2019 and prefixes and suffixes, however this isn\u2019t exclusive. Why does this happen? Because science is like the law, in the sense that precept builds upon precept, and if something is basically factual, then it sets a precedent for guiding research to the logical end. When it is desired to have an improvement to the technology that is beyond trying to optimize the current technology any further (having reached the theoretical limit), still you describe what you want in terms of what you originally wanted. Sometimes this skips a generation in popular usage by one group of people. Let\u2019s look at the example of wanting a light source. You can\u2019t make the sun or moon so the only things you can grasp or make primitively is fire or collect luminescent bugs or plants. Primitively, the technology isn\u2019t understood for luminescence, so development proceeded along the lines of fire, creating the big torches, and the portable oil lamps. These were refined along the lines of cheap fuel like plant oil, whale oil, then kerosene. Then they found that a specially made mantle in the flame glowed with a white light, better than the flame, itself. Gaslight was a means of more easily distributing fuel for a flame, and science provided materials, which in the combustion of the flame, provided about the best light the technology was capable of. Generations of campers used hand-pumped unleaded gasoline with rare-earth infused ash mantles to provide brilliant outdoor light. Electricity, DC and then AC provided a safer and easier means for having light without open flame. Enter the filament bulb, then the arc light, the low and high pressure Sodium energy discharge lamps, the mercury discharge lamps from which the fluorescents derived, and the Xenon and Halogen bulbs, which pushed filament technology to the end of it\u2019s life. With research into physics, the investigation into semiconductor junctions produced what we call LEDs. Once light was found, naturally from red they looked for green, struggled for quite awhile to come up with blue, struggled more to figure how to make white and describe and control the whiteness in specific terms of degrees, Kelvin. Then it became a power-semiconductor search to make LEDs of high brilliance for displays and flashlights (Brits still refer to as torches). This doesn\u2019t even go into microwave research leading to lasers, then laser LEDs. If we come up with any other technology to produce light, people will go back to basic research to start the development, but USAers will still probably call the portable version a flashlight, and the Brit-influenced will still call it a torch.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m fascinated by this questions as much as by the answers. The ones that actually try and give an answer (mostly citing languages that have been used in science and going back to the Latin/Greek roots) and the one (only one, very amusing to read) that wonder the very sense of the question. Thus, I have asked myself what would I write - I love that Quoran actually seem to most of them to ask themselves such a question prior to giving an answer\u2026 it\u2019s almost the opposite of most Twitter and Facebook user, I\u2019d say - and I have concluded that I would first give myself a try at answering the question in the comment to the Question (the Quora Question Details Bot question: What makes a language \u201cmore scientific\u201d) and see if I can then find an answer to that. How would I say \u201cto be scientific\u201d can apply to a language. To its rules? To the pronunciation? What is \u201cto be scientific\u201d. Here we are! I\u2019d say it relates to be dependable. That is: you can - to a certain extent and knowing the laws well enough - foresee the results. Some other peculiar characteristic I\u2019d expect from a \u201cscientific language\u201d would be its reversibility, that being that I could possibly get a hint of what I\u2019m reading/hearing reverse-engineering it. Last but not least, I\u2019d say that such a language should be as much able as possible to describe univocally concepts and objects, that is: one word, one concept; one concept, one word. Now, with such definition(s) in mind, I\u2019d put my vote on - amongst the European Languages - on German. ",
