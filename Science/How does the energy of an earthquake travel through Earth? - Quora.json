            "answer_text": "The earthquake begins as a breakage, called a rupture, of rock over an area on a fault, called the rupture area. The rupture initiates at a point called the hypocenter or the focus, and propagates at a speed that does not exceed the speed of shear waves. The effect of the rupture is to cause the two sides of the fault to slide in opposite directions to each other. There is a tendency to think of rocks as being rigid, but that is not the case. Rocks can be strained by tectonic forces. When the rupture occurs, the rocks spring back, transmitting strain energy into neighboring rocks, which then propagates away from the fault rupture as seismic waves. The amplitudes of the seismic waves from high magnitude earthquakes are so large near the fault rupture that the accelerations can shake building to destruction. The seismic waves continue to propagate spreading out through the entire Earth, eventually vanishing due to anelastic attenuation which is frictional loss of wave motion, degrading the seismic wave energy to heat.
