            "answer_text": "I could tell you what the scientific method is, but I can\u2019t tell you what the \u201cnonscientific method\u201d is, because I have no idea what that is. The modern scientific method, in short: We start by gathering observations about some phenomenon that we want to understand.From the observations, we infer the best/simplest explanation, and construct a hypothesis from that.Make sure that the hypothesis is falsifiable, that it makes predctions that can be tested. If it doesn\u2019t make testable/falsifiable predictions, throw it out and try again, because it\u2019s useless.Test the predictions that the hypothesis makes. Repeat, and gather/record data.If the predictions do not come out true, the hypothesis is obviously false, so throw it away (perhaps only in part) and try again from point 2.If the predictions seem to come out true, publish your findings in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.After this point, it\u2019s kind of no longer in your hands, but in the hands of the scientific community. If the hypothesis really holds water, it\u2019ll overtime become more accepted and used, unless it\u2019s made obsolete by something even better. But it\u2019s possible that other scientists who try to confirm your findings will be unable to confirm it, in which case your hypothesis will be disputed and discarded/forgotten.But if it keeps holding up, eventually it\u2019s simply be \u201cconsidered theory\u201d, whether it stands as its own theory, or gets absorbed by another theory and becomes part of that, so to speak. There\u2019s of course a lot to say about how you should present your data, and stuff about statistical significance, and so on, but this is the general overview of the scientific method.It\u2019s important to remember that science must be fully transparent, so when you publish your findings you need to provide a thorough explanation of how you performed the test, and show all of your relevant data, and so on. Do not hide anything, or it won\u2019t (should not!) get accepted. Do not risk your reputation by appearing dishonest, here, as the scientific community is not forgiving or dishonesty. This last part of the scientific method, where we present our findings to the scientific community, may sound like it\u2019s not part of the scientific method, but it\u2019s an important part, since this is the self-correcting mechanism. If you are wrong in your science, or if you are lying about the science, the other scientists will find out when they are unable to repeat your results. Therefore, science \u201cworks\u201d, at least in theory. In practice, bad science does slip through, every now and then. ",
