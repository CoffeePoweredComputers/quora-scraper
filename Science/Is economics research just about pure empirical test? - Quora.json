            "answer_text": "This is bad research. Ideally, this is how you should do it: Let's say you'd want to figure out how the forex market works (how the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar varies). You start by thinking about it and realize that if I (american) can buy an iphone for 100\u20ac in France but for 150$ in the US and the 1\u20ac=1$, then I would buy the iphone in France and get it in the US. Then this means that many people would want to sell dollars and buy euros so that they can buy the french iphone. Because a lot of people buy euro, the \"price\" of euro would get higher so that very soon 1\u20ac = 1.5$In that new scenario, the cost of a french iphone and an american iphone would be the same in dollars. That's the basic Purchasing Power Parity argument by the way.You conclude that perhaps price differences between countries should matter for the exchange rate. Furthermore, your tentative theory shows that the exchange rate should move linearly with the prices, that is:\u20ac/$ = price of french iphone / price of american iPhone You then go and test that idea. You pick up the price indices in Europe and America (as obviously not just the iphone can be exchanged!) from the IMF or other source and the foreign exchange. You perform your regression and find that the result is not significant (statistically or economically), then you just proved your theory does not work. If it is significant (statistically and economically), then your theory works. End of work. In real life, it is not so easy. Take the previous example and assume that I have shown it does not work... Should I bury my theory? Probably not. Once you've got your negative result, you would realize that your theory is not well fleshed out for various reasons.1) I have assumed that buying my iphone from France is free, I can get it for 100\u20ac in the US... That's obviously false as the french iphone is in France and you need to ship it to you first. This has a cost. Plus, there could be import taxes... Thus, even if the french iphone is 100\u20ac in France, chances are you'd need to pay 150\u20ac to bring it to the US... In that case, you should have 1\u20ac=1$! You therefore conclude that you should have controlled by \"transaction costs\", included the costs of bringing stuff to the US from France and vice versa in the price indices.2) Many commodities cannot be shipped to the states. For example fresh oysters. Whatever their price in France, you'd probably not want to import them through Fedex... Thus, you should probably not use the price index for all consumer goods but perhaps only for a subset of those goods (those that can be exchanged). So you perform your analysis again (with reason!) and find, again, that there is no correlation... Are you ready to drop your theory yet? I'm not, indeed, take point 1) above, I have not really taken the point to its full conclusion. Let's assume that it costs 50\u20ac to bring the iphone to the US and 50$ from the US to France. Then if the iPhone US price increases barely to 160$, then you would import from France and everything is well. However, what happens if the price of the US iphone drop to 100$... Well with the given exchange rate of 1\u20ac=1$ and the american price of a french iphone being 150\u20ac, you figure that french should start buying american iPhones... But that's not true, french still buy the french iphone at 100\u20ac, but they would buy the american iphone at 150$ so still no exchange would happen... Thus, if the american iphone's price moves between 66$ and 150$, no exchanges happen and we'd expect no move in the exchange rate... Haha! our regression should not have been linear! It should have been a random walk inside a band (i.e.: for smallish price variations, no moves in exchange rate) and only start moving when the price variations are high!An lo and behold, when you perform that test, it does work! End of example. As you can see in my example of what \"good\" research looks like, it is fairly close to what you described. That's because the way I added complexity in my empirical tests was validated by my theoretical insights. Finally, this should not be the end of it. Once you figure that your theory is complete (based on that back and forth between data and theory). The problem is that in this example, I have modified my theory in accordance with the data so in and of itself, you should NOT be entirely convinced. In order to be more sure, you should then test your theory, as is, with other exchange rates. But this time, you are NOT allowed to modify it! Either it works and your theory is robust, or it does not and you can conclude that the only reason why it \"worked\" in the US/France case was because you faked it until you made it... Conclusion: good research is hard to distinguish from bad research and no single study should be taken as \"truth\" or conclusive proof. Mostly, I would say that you need a theory in order to make it work, it is ok to tweak your theory a little bit to stick to the data, but up to a certain limit. What this limit is? I don't know. That's why replication is important (replication being the moment when you test your final theory with other datasets without allowing yourself to modify your theory...). Another way to put it, I can't give you a rule set in stone of what is good research and what is bad research... I can just look at individual studies, be critical and make my own opinion about it. For instance, I think that my example was fairly convincing and I did not blatantly fish any result. You could disagree... Let's say that everyone will have a different threshold of what is acceptable and what is not on a case by case basis. In any case, that's a big question, I am sure there is a lot more to say about the subject but I think I'm done for the day... ",
