            "answer_text": "The future technologies that are in progress and will be touching our lives in near future. Some of the technologies are used for the research purpose e.g. ventablack, virtual animal Gesture Control Device:  This gesture control device is called Reemo. It is a device that can control nearly everything you want. Instead of searching for light switches, walking to a radio to turn it on or even making coffee, with Reemo you can just point to what you want and control it. You can even lock the doors or arm the security system from a far distance. Reemo can also help seniors to go through the frustration of solving everyday technical problems. Since Reemo uses gestures that are intuitive and natural, it is very simple to use and you will have no trouble with remembering the commands. The Active Denial System:  This directed-energy weapon is designed for area denial, crowd control and perimeter security. The Active Denial system was developed by the U.S. military and is not a lethal weapon. Since it\u2019s only function is to heat the surface of targets, such as the human skin, it is often called a heat ray. In 2010, the weapon was deployed in Afganistan as the U.S. army wanted to test it, but it was soon withdrawn without seeing any combat. Currently, the ADS is only a weapon mounted to the vehicle, but both the police and the U.S. Marines are working on portable versions. Nuclear batteries: Imagine a battery that won't run out of charge. Nuclear batteries can produce a large amount of energy and can work \"at least\" for 20 years. The batteries contains heavy metals that could give out radiation. Nuclear batteries use the incredible amount of energy released naturally by tiny bits of radio active material without any fission or fusion taking place inside the battery. These devices use thin radioactive films that pack in energy at densities thousands of times greater than those of lithium-ion batteries. Because of the high energy density, nuclear batteries are extremely small in size. They can be used as energy source for our mobile devices, tablets, Laptops, UPS, Cars, Vehicle  The algorithm that can detect whether a person is gay or straight: Technology today is accelerating so fast it's hard to comprehend. In the latest step towards a future that's looking more AI controlled every second, a study at Stanford University found that a computer algorithm could correctly guess whether a person is straight or gay highly accurately. This machine intelligence can tell whether a man is straight or gay correctly 81% of the time, and 74% of the time for women. It can't work as a perfect determinant of sexual orientation as a whole, but it has made it more apparent, in case it wasn't already, that a person's sexual orientation is not a choice but something you're born with. It also worked a lot more accurately than with human judges, who only achieved 61% for men and 54% for women.  strange :- Virtual Animals with Digital Minds: Whole brain emulations of human minds are quite a ways off, and likely won't appear until the second half of the 21st Century. But in the stage leading up to this we'll be able to emulate the brains of much simpler organisms. Already today there's the OpenWorm project, an effort to digitize the brain of a nematode worm. Within the next two decades, we will most certainly be able to simulate the brains of other organisms, like ants and bees. And who knows, by this point we might even be able to start simulate the brains of simple mammals, like mice. But by virtue of doing so, we will have created virtual animals who essentially \"live\" inside a computer. And someday, perhaps even by the 2030s, these digital brains will be uploaded to robotic avatars.  Darkest material till known: It\u2019s called Vantablack and it\u2019s the blackest possible substance on the planet earth that absorbs 99.96% of light. It\u2019s made of carbon nano tubes aligned vertically. The piece of aluminum foil shown here is creased, wrinkled, in a random fashion before being coated with Vantablack on one side. But as we can see the surface appears as either a completely flat black surface or simply a void. The almost total lack of light reflected from the Vantablack surface prevents the eye detecting any surface detail.  \u200b Sonic weapon  Sonic and ultrasonic weapons (USW) are weapons of various types that use sound to injure, incapacitate, or kill an opponent. Some sonic weapons are currently in limited use or in research and development by military and police forces. Some of these weapons have been described as sonic bullets, sonic grenades, sonic mines, or sonic cannons. Some make a focused beam of sound or ultrasound; some make an area field of sound. Extremely high-power sound waves can disrupt or destroy the eardrums of a target and cause severe pain or disorientation. This is usually sufficient to incapacitate a person. Less powerful sound waves can cause humans to experience nausea or discomfort. The use of these frequencies to incapacitate persons has occurred both in anti-citizen special operation and crowd control settings. Which is Successfully deployed in Canada during G20 summit in 2010. (Thanks J Stevens for sharing about Sonic weapon) I will be adding new technologies .. Please suggest me to add any new technology. I will be keen to add ",

            "answer_text": "1. 3-D printed organs 3-D printing is going to be an increasingly big deal in the future. It's already being used to print prosthetics, guns, machine parts and food. One of the most exciting developments, however, is \"bio-printing.\" This uses 3-D printing technology to create human tissue and organs. A company named Organovo recently printed a slice of human liver that survived 40 days. This is great news for medical researchers looking for human tissue to test drugs. Other teams have printed kidney and heart tissue. As the technology gets even better, we could see full-fledged organs printed using cells from a patient's own body. Some researchers predict we could have bio-printed hearts this decade. The need for transplant donors and worries about organ rejection would be over! 2. Real bionics Earlier, I mentioned 3-D printed prosthetics. Researchers have made big strides in the prosthetics field recently. On the cost front, 3-D printing is starting to bring down prosthetic prices to a reasonable level. On the high-end side, new neural connections and software advances are allowing amputees to control prosthetic limbs with their mind - just like a real limb! They can even get feedback on sensations like heat, cold and pressure. Advances in motors and pneumatic mean prosthetics are more responsive and have smoother motion. Remember how they rebuilt Luke Skywalker's hand in the second \"Star Wars\" movie? That's not too far off. It isn't just limbs. New prosthetic eye technology, for example, is giving sight to the blind. 3. Graphene Moving away from the medical field, have you heard about graphene? This is one of the new wonder materials that has scientists and researchers abuzz. Graphene is a version of graphite - yes, the stuff in pencil lead. However, graphene is only a single atom thick and comes in sheets. In that form, it has more uses that I have space to mention. It conducts electricity like a superconductor and it's incredibly strong for its weight. It could replace silicon in computer chips. Graphene chips will run up to one hundred times faster than silicon models, but use less electricity and take up less space. Because it's only a single atom thick, graphene is transparent, making it perfect for electronic components in touch screens and electronic displays. Thanks to its thermal conductivity, it could be used in transparent solar cells. Imagine every window of your house generating electricity. At the other end of the electricity chain, it could make light, flexible batteries far more powerful than anything today. Graphene's structure allows water vapor to pass through, but no other substances. That makes it perfect for creating alternative fuels and distilling alcohol. In the medical field, this property could be used to diagnose diseases and sequence DNA. I could go on about puncture-proof tires, wearable electronics and so much more, but I think you get the idea. So, keep an eye out for this wonder material in the coming years. 4. Wearable computers I'm sure you've heard about Google Glass. If you haven't, this is basically a smartphone built into a pair of glasses. The display shows up right in front of your eyes, and you control it with your voice. Google Glass isn't a home-run success just yet. Thanks to its built-in camera, it's already banned from many establishments. Some techies disdain it. Plus, it's expensive and still a bit bulky. But even sleeker products are on the way. A company called Innovega has its iOptik system. This uses special contact lenses that let your eye focus on near and far objects at the same time. A pair of glasses with small projectors sends HD images right to your eyes via the contacts. The end result is like high-quality screens floating in front of you everywhere you look. Of course, you will need to tie the glasses to a smartphone to run everything. Still, in coming years, as smartphones get even smaller, it could be built right into the glasses. Of course, many companies are jumping on the wearable computer bandwagon. Right now, they're mostly just elaborate sensors, but eventually they'll get more features. Heapsylon is making socks that record how you run and give you feedback to improve and prevent injury. Microsoft is working on a \"smart\" bra that senses a woman's emotions. Apple is rumored to be working on an iRing that works as a motion control for Apple TV, and Google is working on a ring that replaces your passwords. OK, so they aren't all winners. Still, you never know what game-changing products might come out of these early steps. 5. Space travel China's recent successful landing of an unmanned rover on the Moon was big news. And it's always a treat to get images and video from the International Space Station. However, the days of government space agencies dominating the spotlight are coming to an end. NASA is already using rockets from a private company called SpaceX to send supplies to the ISS. Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic is well on the way to full-fledged space tourism. Ad Astra Rocket Co. could be testing its VASIMR engine at the ISS in a few years. This highly-efficient, plasma-based engine could cut the flight time to Mars from nine months to three months. The U.K. is moving forward with funding for Reaction Engine's SABRE engine. This novel engine could allow for passenger planes that travel up to Mach 5. Imagine flying halfway around the world in just four hours! It could also allow space planes that take off like normal aircraft, fly into space, and then return to earth with no hassle. ",

            "answer_text": "New Technology which will change our life magically. Several technologies will be evaluated in 2019. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) Radio-frequency identification (RFID) uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The tags contain electronically stored information. Passive tags collect energy from a nearby RFID reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source (such as a battery) and may operate hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a barcode, the tags don't need to be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method of automatic identification and data capture (AIDC). Wireless Connected Vehicles Many cars in the world are already somehow connected to the Internet. By combining Wi-Fi and GPS signals, they can now alert drivers to potential hazards or obstacles. For example, if the cartouches two vehicles for the driver, but the front side does not work, this technology warns of a loud beep and a blinking red light on the windshield to hit the brakes. Communicating with each other and road infrastructure, vehicle safety has improved significantly, while congestion and CO2 emissions have been reduced. The system is so effective that in some countries death of accidents is reduced by 80%. Self-driving Cars Okay, so, these aren't exactly unknown, but that doesn't mean we should just take it for granted! The fact that self-driving cars are a reality is mind blowing. Speech jammer guns that stop people from talking. The MIT Technology review says Japanese researchers built a \"gun\" that could jam people's speech: \"It records a person's voice and replays it to them with a delay of about 0.2 seconds. The microphone and speaker are directional, so the device can be aimed at a speaker from a distance, like a gun.\" Bionic Eyes high-resolution bionic eyes are now available for patients with degenerative vision loss. The first prototypes of this technology were somewhat rough and granular, with less than 100 resolution. However, these new versions offer more than 1000 points, so, this allows patients to recognize faces and read capital print. Transparent Solar Panels Transparent luminescent solar concentrators (TLSC) or transparent solar panels were created at Michigan State University and are made of organic salts that absorb specific non-visible wavelengths. Usually, solar cells work by absorbing the light which creates a shadow as they cannot let the light pass through. This problem by taking the ultraviolet and infrared light and \u201cluminescing\u201d them as another wavelength of infrared light. This new infrared light is guided to and collected at the edges where thin strips of conventional photovoltaic solar cells are present.

            "answer_text": "Transparent Aluminum Armor  What starts as powder and suddenly becomes so powerful it can withstand bullets? Well, with a little bit (OK a lot) of heat and pressure: the latest in transparent armor. Lighter and even stronger than bulletproof glass, the Air Force has been testing aluminum oxynitride (ALON) in hopes of replacing windows in its aircraft. And judging by the fact that the clear ceramic material can stop a .50-caliber rifle\u2019s bullet travelling 2,700 feet per second \u2014 normally powerful enough to slice through a lightly armored vehicle like butter \u2014 we\u2019d say that\u2019s a more-than-justified investment. Color-changing Contact Lenses That Alert Diabetics of Glucose Levels  What better way to see into the future than through a pair of smart contact lenses that change color according to your glucose level? This is what health care will soon look like for diabetes patients, as a team of biochemical engineers at the University of Western Ontario have developed a technology that uses nanoparticles that react with the glucose molecules in one\u2019s tears to cause the change in color, should one\u2019s blood sugar be too low. Diabetic or not, the obvious convenience of not having to draw blood daily is matched only by just how cool you\u2019ll look. Sprayable Energy  Don\u2019t drink coffee? Hate the aftertaste of energy drinks? Twenty-one-year-old tech fellow Ben Yu and his 33-year-old venture capitalist partner Deven Soni have come up with a solution for that. With a quick spray on the neck or wrist using their own brand of bottled energy, their proprietary caffeine formula is absorbed through the skin and distributed through the body over the course of several hours for a longer buzz than your typical cup of joe. While the tech is still patent pending, workaholics looking for the $15-a-bottle alternative to Red Bull can expect to see it available as early as October 2013 \u2014 whereupon sudden, significant spikes in productivity will finally bring an end to our long, national nightmare of recession. (Maybe.) 3D Printing  Already on the market and not without its share of controversy, 3D printing is just beginning to revolutionize our personal lives and impact nearly every corner of scalable manufacturing. Ranging anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to a few thousand, the now-affordable consumer product allows users to create virtually any shape from a digital model. From industrial to domestic use, an additive process using successive layers of material is able to create anything from bikes to underwear, toys from kid drawings, \u201cfoods,\u201d and yes, even firearms. With an open source distribution of data free for the taking, look for 3D printing to stick around much longer than the old cartridge-based ink jet collecting dust in your garage.

There are some inventions which take things to a whole new level, like: Ironius: The Coffee Mug Iron  As weird as it may look, this cup is eco friendly, as it is saving electricity by not using an iron which you have to plug in and use with power. The only downside is that you may spill your drink on your clothes.The Weight Watch Belt  Although it wouldn\u2019t be worn as a fashion statement, this is actually a pretty damn good idea! I would wear it simply to motivate myself to lose that extra few kilos so my waist would be slightly slimmer.Sleeping Bag with Arms and Legs  My friend actually has one of these! If I recall correctly, she bought it from Aldi, and I really want one since they look so comfortable! I reckon you\u2019d get real hot though.Quack: A Duck-Billed Protective Muzzle For Dogs   Having a greyhound means she needs to be muzzled (yeah, in some parts of Australia it\u2019s the law. My dog looks like she has a CAGE on her mouth. This still looks so uncomfortable, but reasonable better (and cuter) than having a cage on the mouth.Pizza Scissors  The pizza scissors would be great if the toppings always fall off the pizza! And, the sizes of the slices would be even, with the built in spatula!Din-Ink Pen Cap Eating Utensils    A great invention for all office workers. Imagine that doomed moment when you forget your cutlery - not to worry! Just rummage around in your pencil case and - TA DA! ***applause***The Rolling Bench That You Can Use After Rain   Sick of sitting on a wet seat? Alas, the rotating bench! If the seat is wet, simple rotate it, and there you have a dry seat, ready to be sat on.Spaghetti Measuring Tool  By using this cool spaghetti measuring tool, you will ensure that everyone gets the right amount of food. Since men, women and children require different portion sizes, this is a great way to make sure you measure the right amount.Twister Fork  Don\u2019t forget this unusual fork for eating the spaghetti with! With it\u2019s curly spikes, this spaghetti fork will ensure the pasta doesn\u2019t fall off the cutlery. No more Pasta La Vista!Reusable Candle  I have to admit, this one is my favourite. Although it won\u2019t be COMPLETELY reusable, this candle is pretty cool, and saves money from not buying half as many candles. Ain\u2019t it cool?Credits: 30 Weird And Awesome Invention Ideas 25 Truly Useful Inventions That You Never Knew You Needed What were your favourite inventions? Let me know down below in the comments! I\u2019d love to hear from you! ;) ",

            "answer_text": "The aging process in humans has actually been solved: Aging is shown as caused by competition for resource from bacterial colonization of the large intestine. Metchnikoff proved bacteria were unnecessary for the function of the colon. Uncontrollable exponential growth of bacteria colonizing the colon utilizes all available protein when it happens. The body is then forced to borrow from structure to continue. The observed results are the physical and functional decline seen with age. Aging appears as a specialized form of starvation that involves the absence of protein nutrition, only. Clinicians who work with the elderly have long suspected a nutritional component to aging. Nutritional supplements may soon control aging. That nutrition is the initial problem leading to aging is not unexpected. The lack of absorption of nutrition is shown in multiple ways to be the trigger for the process of aging in humans. Aging is an accumulation of damage and corresponding lack of repair. This damage leads to changes in physical function and appearance. In human aging, it is the combination of external forces acting on the physical body (smoking, sun damage) but also \u2026something else. This \u201csomething else\u201d is a uniquely human genetic adaptation that becomes triggered by the lack of absorption of critical nutrition. It is the ability to steal from existing physical structure to continue living. This trait holds responsibility for much of the physical appearance of aged individuals. The trigger of the aging process is the lack of absorption of specific, common amino acids. There are many physical signs of intestinal decline occurring in the process of aging. However, few are willing to accept rogue gut bacteria as the cause of aging. That these were once part of the normal gut flora is especially troubling. The immune system cannot begin attacking normal flora species even if they are in a new location and even if their explosive growth uses all available protein. There are multiple other possibilities that were considered for the loss of amino acid uptake capacity. The formation of biofilm is one. This too is of bacterial causation. Metchnikoff did prove, without doubt, that bacteria were unnecessary for function of the colon. Any bacteria colonizing the colon would therefore have no duties and be free to only eat and reproduce. The presence of diverticulitis has been speculated to correspond with exponential growth of bacteria when there is insufficient protein entering the gut. Rogue bacteria appear to eat, even when no one else does. The freedom of bacteria to reproduce at will and at exponential rates is the key to aging damage. Each pound of bacteria contains around a trillion individuals. Certainly over time, this could add up to quite significant levels of demand for protein nutrition. The process also can happen quite quickly, as well. Untreated HIV AIDS also develops aging like symptoms via competition for resource. Aging and the wasting of AIDS are accompanied by essentially the same mechanisms. They are each uncontrollable infections because of lack of immune function. What other possibilities could cause that which has been observed? \u201cGenetics\u201d is a widely accepted reason for differing appearance and individual traits among individuals. Starvation, the total lack of nutrition, is also well known to cause changes in appearance and function similar to those observed in aging. The key differences are starvation lacking all nutrition and the lack of only specific amino acid nutrition in aging. Starvation has already been shown as reversible. Genetic damage is not reversible. Which nutrition is unabsorbed? Gut bacteria have first choice of all food intake. Bacteria are the ultimate beneficiaries of any unabsorbed nutrition. However, in periods of exponential growth of those bacteria involved in colonization of the colon \u2026all available protein is consumed. Other nutrients are left for the host to absorb. Even in aging \u2026humans have no trouble absorbing fats and carbs. In the literature, some of the twenty amino acids comprising protein in the human body have known problems of absorption in adult humans. Biological aging begins with a lack of intestinal absorption of at least one, some, or all of these amino acids. Which or all of these amino acids becomes primarily lacking would change the observed outcome in the function or structure of the body. Often structures, like facial collagen, is altered due to its having been plundered for amino acids. The body apparently never gives-up without trying to replace missing nutrients. Often, replacement for missing amino acids are acquired from non-visible areas such as the outer structure of small capillaries. This is not noticeable or even missed, unless a stroke or visible hematoma occurs. Many aging related changes may not become readily apparent until late in the aging process. Individuals, therefore, display symptoms of advancing age at differing rates. In summary, humans require all 20 amino acids to build any protein. Therefore, the inability to absorb specific amino acids forces the lymph system to \"steal\" missing needed nutrition from some (less important) physical bodily structure to continue life. Otherwise, the protein or peptide or other bodily process remains unfinished. Genetic changes allow aging The first rule of biology is: Use it, or lose it. In evolution, useful traits are passed on and non-useful ones are not. In the individual body, the first rule states: cells remaining unused are recycled for other uses. This is a primary lymph system function. The human lymph system is much more aggressive than in most other animals, especially when there is a sharp decline in nutritional uptake. This genetic adaptation is shared by all living humans and is why humans have the ability to live for up to 60 days without solid food. As this trait is useful for survival during times of famine, the trait of a more aggressive lymph system has been passed on. Ordinarily, the lymph system is charged with providing protein nutrition within the body for building structure or making peptides to control function. The lymph system must source amino acids for use in bodily processes at the right time and correct sequence \u2026or the specific process will not occur. This characteristic of aging is not caused by gene damage. Even the most perfect RNA cannot form protein without having every needed amino acid in the correct order. Debility and Sarcopenia Facial wrinkles are usually the first sign of aging to be observed. Wrinkles are caused by the loss of collagen from below the skin. In aging, missing collagen is \"stolen\" by the body for it's amino acid content. Facial collagen decline and the subdural hematoma often seen in aging are simply outward structural signs of aggressive lymph system activity. In aging, the lymph system can become extremely aggressive in recycling seldom-used muscle and other structure to provide missing amino acids. The processes of starvation and that of aging are closely related. Starvation is triggered by the lack of all nutrition. Aging is triggered by the lack of specific protein nutrition. In aging, the body uses protein reserves and recycles structures such as muscle and collagen because these are sources of complete protein. These resources contain all twenty of the necessary amino acids. The protein that is able to be absorbed from the intestine is often incomplete. Disease Diabetes and hypertension are the first diseases seen with age. Both diseases are caused by faults in processes that use peptides for regulation and control. Lack of one single necessary amino acid is enough to halt production of a peptide. The lack of a single peptide is enough to upset the sensitive feedback loops seen in each bodily process. It is just too easy to cite genetic decline for faulty processes that were actually caused by a lack of the specific amino acids. All necessary amino acids must be available to complete the RNA to finished protein process. This is an epigenetic rather than genetic flaw. Even with advanced age the genetic structure remains intact. Simple Proof Genetic modification to reverse aging has yet to be done. Replacement of missing peptides has been demonstrated successfully. Peptide replacement drugs such as the diabetics drug exenatide actually reverse diabetic decline. Lack of specific and common amino acids is the primary cause of aging. Replacement of this missing amino acid nutrition to slow or halt symptoms of aging has been successfully accomplished. Amino acid nutrition has been formulated so that it cannot be absorbed by bacteria in the colon. That the product is successfully absorbed by the body and appears to halt aging related changes \u2026adds further evidence. Other gut bacteria related intestinal changes are seen in aging, as well. There is little chance any of this is caused by human genetic damage. Changes in composition of gut bacteria simply cannot be accounted for by a human genetic damage theory of aging. The nutrition theory is even better proven in the Princeton senescent cell study in mice. Senescent cells are unused cells becoming dormant due to non-use. In debility they will be recycled to provide missing complete nutrition. Destroying senescent cells creates pools of complete nutrition. The body apparently uses amino acid components of the break down to repair and replace other cells. Therefore, the mice in the study do better. This may not be because of lack of senescence cells but because of the use of these components in repair. As the mouse genes can accomplish that repair \u2026would likely disprove genetic damage as a cause of aging. The end result of this study is the same as that demonstrated by a patent pending nutritional product. Senescent cells, therefore, are unlikely to be the key to halting aging. The total of evidence shows the lack of specific amino acids to be the culprit in aging. Lack of complete nutrition is thereby confirmed as the primary cause of aging. ",

            "answer_text": "Alright, so this one is a relatively old (2 years I guess) and improving piece of software tech majorly found in the United States. Everyone must know about this virtual assistant called Google Assistant  Google has been working on this fascinating project called Google Duplex. So, what this does is it allows users to make any reservation (say a restaurant, hair-cut saloon, movie, etc.) by phone. Not so fascinating, right !! Wait let me tell you the fascinating part\u2026 While making the reservation, it isn\u2019t the user speaking directly to the other person for making the reservation, but it is the assistant doing it for him. Google Assistant, with a human-sounding voice, speaks with an actual human to set a reservation for you, the user. Not only that, but Google has also included pauses while the Assistant speaks and also words like \u2018um\u2019 to make it sound more human-like. I don\u2019t really know how accurately it works, it's pretty limited as far as I know. Not all restaurants support it and it still has a long way to go, but the mere existence of such technology fascinates me. Marques Brownlee has made a good video on Google Duplex if you want to check it out:  So, the next time you wanna make a restaurant reservation or movie reservation, just say \u201cOK Google\u201d, pick a restaurant, or movie theatre, or salon which supports this feature and just say \u2018Make a reservation and the time\u2019. Google Assistant will do the rest and send a notification stating the reservation details. Gone are the days when Virtual Assistants were used just to \u201cKnow the weather\u201d or \u201cGet web results for miscellaneous questions \u201d It is really thrilling to see AI reach new heights every day and this is just the beginning!!! P.S. Check out the \u201cSmart Summon\u201d feature of Tesla Cars (A relatively newer AI Tech). The car literally navigates through a goddamn parking lot to find and come to the Tesla user until the user is within its line of sight. Some next-level tech stuff!! Peace!! ",

Maybe this wouldn't sound wonderful, but they will likely change the world a little letting makers and companies to make IoT products that are affordable. These little beasts can enable swarm robotics!For example this is a good tiny board to try it:https://wordpress.com/post/siluxmedia.wordpress.com/1139 Hadoop. Ever wondered if you can just cobble more PC together and get more power? With the Hadoop software task you can make your own personal supercomputer out of 20-50$ single board computers like Raspberry Pi.Raspberry Pi Zero. 5$ and you get a computer motherboard. They are so popular that when 20k of units is restocked usually they get sold out in hours.http://hadoop.apache.org  JavaScript. The language. So many libraries add new functions and the browser can use optimizations to run it as fast as native code. Learn it and you can rule almost any machine.You can even learn it with interactive examples! http://www.w3schools.com/js/ Global e-commerce. 90% of what is sold in a supermarket is imported. Just find the seller and buy directly from him to save money. Same applies also in the reverse. Do you have a good product/service/competence to sell? Now you can easily expand the horizon. Commoditized software development.  You can buy templates to make websites, apps, pay on use API that use big data on the back end, rent CPU, RAM, storage for cheap. That means if you have a good idea you don't need to open a start up, but can try if it works with minimal effort.To get an idea of what i'm talking go there http://themeforest.net Home robots. Robot vacuums are cheap now, and change life a little. Before I wasn't just caring much about the floors and had a mild dust allergy. Now that I have a bot to clean the rooms once a day while I'm away i'm free to do more meaningful things, breathe better, I don't worry nomore if something falls and I can't find it or some powder or glass falls. Plus I hacked it to gather metals with some magnets on the front. Mesh WiFi Networking. In a mesh network each node can send, receive and relay messages. If you just want send a message to the neighbor, you can just send it directly to him, without passing trough an Intenet Service Provider, with lower latency, higher band and more reliable connection. The Mesh Networking expands this kind of messaging also to neighbors of neighbors , where your every node relays messages to others, until message reaches the destination. This can be done on consumer networking hardware, and can be made faster with some WiMax bridges, which are more powerful antennas. Mesh networking enables services in the local community like free video calls, video streaming, sharing easily data storage, free web hosting.Ninux mesh networking http://wiki.ninux.org/FrontPage ",

            "answer_text": "You have all probably seen these while surfing the web, but do you know the purpose of it and how exactly it verifies whether or not you\u2019re a robot?  This is called a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). They were invented in 2003 by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in order to be used as a security check on websites to ensure only human users can pass through.  Only humans can read this text, computers can\u2019t! So now millions of captchas are being solved every single day, isn\u2019t there a way that all this brain power can be put to good use? YES, there is. The creators of ReCaptcha started scanning books and converting them into PDFs using software; any words that were too hard for the computer to convert they would put into a captcha and let a human convert them. At this point 100 million ReCaptchas were being solved every day -- the equivalent of 2.5 million books a year. So Google says \u201clet\u2019s buy ReCaptcha\u201d and they did in 2009. Google digitized all of Google books and all of the New York Times archives. When they ran out of books to digitize Google started giving people street numbers from Google street view to help Google maps. Everything was going great, until\u2026 computer technology started getting advanced enough to solve captchas on its own. They started making captchas harder to solve, but eventually the technology caught on and Google needed a new strategy. So Google engineers came up with the captcha that we all know and love!  When you click the checkbox, it sends over an HTTP request to Google with information like your IP address, your location and time, the way you move your cursor before you click, how you were scrolling the page, time intervals, and more. Most of the time the machine learning bots over at Google can tell whether or not you are a robot, but if they\u2019re still unsure you get something like this-  And that\u2019s how Google can tell who\u2019s a human and who isn\u2019t. pretty cool, huh? credit goes to this guy for the idea and the info, thanks! I'm not a robot ^^I highly recommend this video Edit: Many people were asking how Google knows the answer to the captcha, since the whole point is that robots can't solve them. The answer is that ReCaptcha uses two words in their captchas, one of which they know, and one of which they don't know (a street sign or word from a book that needs converting). ",

            "answer_text": "The Nazis may have invented a primitive and not safely useable form of anti gravity or inertia cancelling technology during WW2. Records suggest that the lead scientist was a member of the Vrill society and a total lunatic. He seems to have believed that he was building a device to summon massive amounts of Vrill energy, a supposed form of life force. His accidental invention of anti gravity came too late in the war to be applied to German aircraft, and seems have ended up in Soviet hands. The story goes that the Soviets never worked the kinks out of the technology, and even crashed an experimental aircraft based around it in America in the late 40s, after which the USAF started experimenting with it. Because the technology was invented by accident, we don't have the physical and mathematical framework to understand how or why it works. As a result, the governments keeping it secret probably can't figure or how to make any not based on the original Nazi \u201cBell\". Another disputed technology that won't die is cold fusion. Officially, no cold fusion experiment has ever been successfully reproduced. But every few years another scientist or engineer builds a cold fusion device that seems to produce excess heat, publishes a report in a non-peer reviewed publication, and the scientific community dismisses it out of hand. You can even buy kits online. One technology that definitely exists but an annoying number of laypeople don't believe in it is spacecraft capable of flying through the Van Allen Radiation Belts. A guy claiming to be a \u201cformer NASA scientist\" gave a speech claiming that we don't have the ability to fly manned spacecraft through the VARBs, which you have to do to get to moon. I haven't actually seen this speech so I don't know what he actually said, but since we definitely sent humans to the moon 9 times, he was either misunderstood or incorrect. The VARBs are only a few hundred miles thick, can be crossed in just a few minutes, and the radiation in them can be blocked by a few millimeters of metal foil. We haven't sent humans through the VARBs since the end of the Apollo Program because no space agency has had sufficient funding to build and launch a long range manned spacecraft. Although unmanned spacecraft pass through the belts a few times a year without even a hiccup. ",

The only thing that sucks are all those wet benches and chairs. Fortunately clever designers (the Korean design gang) came up with a simple solution. The slats on these benches can rotate to the dry side by cranking the handle. No more wet butts! Simple yet mind blowing!   2. Eagle 360 / Developed by Goodyear As companies race to develop self-\u00addriving cars,Goodyear is reinventing their wheels. Its spherical concept tire, which debuted in March, allows cars to move in many new \u00addirections, including sideways into a parallel parking space and at specific angles and speeds to counteract slippery surfaces. The key, says Sebastien Fontaine, an industrial designer at Goodyear, is magnetic levitation: whereas traditional tires are bolted to cars, the Eagle 360s hover beneath them, free from \u201cthe limits of [traditional] steering.\u201d  3. Minimed 670g / Developed by Medtronic In order for people with diabetes to stay healthy, they must continually check their blood sugar and adjust it with insulin or snacks. Medtronic aims to render this tedious process obsolete with its MiniMed 670G, a.k.a. the \u201cartificial pancreas,\u201d which has been in development for years but was only recently approved by the FDA. (It will be commercially available next year.) Once users attach the iPod-size device to their body, it measures their blood-\u00adsugar levels every five minutes, providing more insulin or withholding it as needed. For now, they still need to manually request a dose after they eat. But Medtronic is working on a fully automated version, which Fran Kaufman, chief medical officer of the company\u2019s diabetes group, says she hopes will help the 1.25 million people living with Type 1 diabetes \u201cspend less time managing their disease and more time enjoying life.\u201d  4. UNICEF Kid Power Band One in four American children doesn\u2019t get enough exercise, and 1 in 4 children globally doesn\u2019t get enough food. UNICEF\u2019s Fitbit-like Kid Power Band, designed by San Francisco-based ammunition, aims to address both problems at once. Its mobile app encourages kids to be physically active with videos from stars like Pink and Alex Morgan. Once they meet step goals, it awards them points, which translate to real food packages that UNICEF sends to malnourished children all over the globe (funded in part by sales of the device). The band \u201callows kids to feel like they can change the world,\u201d says Rajesh Anandan, who co-created it. Since Kid Power Band\u2019s soft launch in 2014, participants have collectively walked over 7 million miles to feed more than 30,000 severely malnourished children.  sources -The 25 Best Inventions of 2016 ",

            "answer_text": "Reversing Paralysis: Human can do everything. Only can\u2019t people give life. God gave everything to humans. Now i am describe How can people reversing paralysis\u2026 Scientists are making remarkable progress at using brain implants to restore the freedom of movement that spinal cord injuries take away. Availability: 10 to 15 years.  The French neuroscientist was watching a macaque monkey as it hunched aggressively at one end of a treadmill. His team had used a blade to slice halfway through the animal\u2019s spinal cord, paralyzing its right leg. Now Courtine wanted to prove he could get the monkey walking again. To do it, he and colleagues had installed a recording device beneath its skull, touching its motor cortex, and sutured a pad of flexible electrodes around the animal\u2019s spinal cord, below the injury. A wireless connection joined the two electronic devices. The result: a system that read the monkey\u2019s intention to move and then transmitted it immediately in the form of bursts of electrical stimulation to its spine. Soon enough, the monkey\u2019s right leg began to move. Extend and flex. Extend and flex. It hobbled forward. \u201cThe monkey was thinking, and then boom, it was walking,\u201d recalls an exultant Courtine, a professor with Switzerland\u2019s \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne. In recent years, lab animals and a few people have controlled computer cursors or robotic arms with their thoughts, thanks to a brain implant wired to machines. Now researchers are taking a significant next step toward reversing paralysis once and for all. They are wirelessly connecting the brain-reading technology directly to electrical stimulators on the body, creating what Courtine calls a \u201cneural bypass\u201d so that people\u2019s thoughts can again move their limbs. At Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, a old quadriplegic\u2014he can\u2019t move something however his head and shoulder\u2014agreed to let doctors place 2 recording implants in his brain, of identical sort Courtine employed in the monkeys. fabricated from element, and smaller than a item, they bristle with 100 hair-size metal probes that may \u201clisten\u201d as neurons fireplace off commands. To complete the bypass, the Case team, led by Robert Kirsch and Bolu Ajiboye, also slid more than 16 fine electrodes into the muscles of the man\u2019s arm and hand. In videos of the experiment, the volunteer can be seen slowly raising his arm with the help of a spring-loaded arm rest, and willing his hand to open and close. He even raises a cup with a straw to his lips. Without the system, he can\u2019t do any of that. Just try sitting on your hands for a day. That will give you an idea of the shattering consequences of spinal cord injury. You can\u2019t scratch your nose or tousle a child\u2019s hair. \u201cBut if you have this,\u201d says Courtine, reaching for a red espresso cup and raising it to his mouth with an actor\u2019s exaggerated motion, \u201cit changes your life.\u201d The Case results, pending publication in a medical journal, are a part of a broader effort to use implanted electronics to restore various senses and abilities. Besides treating paralysis, scientists hope to use so-called neural prosthetics to reverse blindness with chips placed in the eye, and maybe restore memories lost to Alzheimer\u2019s disease (see \u201c10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Memory Implants\u201d). And they realize it may work. contemplate tube-shaped structure implants, that use a electro-acoustic transducer to relay signals on to the nervus vestibulocochlearis, routing around non-working elements of the internal ear. Videos of wide-eyed deaf kids hearing their mothers for the primary time go infective agent on the net each month. quite 250,000 cases of hearing disorder are treated. https://cdn.technologyreview.com/v/images/monkeyfaster.gif.mp4?sw=1200 But it\u2019s been harder to turn neural prosthetics into something that helps paralyzed people. A patient first used a brain probe to move a computer cursor across a screen back in 1998. That and several other spectacular brain-control feats haven\u2019t had any broader practical use. The technology remains too radical and too complex to get out of the lab. \u201cTwenty years of work and nothing in the clinic!\u201d Courtine exclaims, brushing his hair back. \u201cWe keep pushing the limits, but it is an important question if this entire field will ever have a product.\u201d A close-up of a brain-reading chip, bristling with electrodes.  Courtine\u2019s laboratory is found in an exceedingly ill glass-and-steel building in Geneva that conjointly homes a $100 million center that land have Hansj\u00f6rg Wyss funded specifically to resolve the remaining technical obstacles to neurotechnologies just like the neural structure bypass. It\u2019s hiring consultants from medical-device manufacturers and Swiss watch firms and has outfitted clean rooms wherever gold wires area unit written onto rubbery electrodes that may stretch as our bodies do. Flexible electrodes developed to simulate the spinal cord.  The head of the center is John Donoghue, an American who led the early development of brain implants in the U.S. (see \u201cImplanting Hope\u201d) and who moved to Geneva two years ago. He is now trying to assemble in one place the enormous technical resources and talent\u2014skilled neuroscientists, technologists, clinicians\u2014needed to create commercially viable systems. Among Donoghue\u2019s top priorities is a \u201cneurocomm,\u201d an ultra-compact wireless device that can collect data from the brain at Internet speed. \u201cA radio inside your head,\u201d Donoghue calls it, and \u201cthe most sophisticated brain communicator in the world.\u201d The matchbox-size prototypes are made of biocompatible titanium with a sapphire window. Courtine used an earlier, bulkier version in his monkey tests. As complex as they are, and as slow as progress has been, neural bypasses are worth pursuing because patients desire them, Donoghue says. \u201cAsk someone if they would like to move their own arm,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople would prefer to be restored to their everyday self. They want to be reanimated.\u201d A model of a wireless neurocommunication device sits on a skull.  ",

            "answer_text": " As we move forward into the future, our need for new technologies that make life better, easier, and more efficient increases too. Innovative ways to produce and conserve energy can help us face up to and counter global warming and other environmental problems. Integrating biology and electronics for faster and advanced healthcare has never been more welcome. New materials that are stronger, lighter, viable, or necessary for space travel and various applications here on Earth are being invented by many scientists all over the world. Many of these might seem unreal, as if they are from science fiction. Here are 10 such mind-blowing technologies that most people don\u2019t know exist in real life and here they are. 1. Electronic Skin or E-Skin An organic circuit 10 times thinner than a human skin cell, lighter than a feather, and that can be worn on the skin like an electronic tattoo. Electronic skin is a temperature and pressure sensitive, thin, electronic material that mimics human skin. Just like human skin, it can stretch and also heal itself. It uses stretchable solar cells developed by a Stanford team in February 2011 for power with an accordion-like microstructure that lets them stretch up to 30% without any damage. The e-skin also contains biological and chemical sensors along with pressure sensors. It sticks to the skin because of Van der Waals forces which are based on the attraction between molecules, rather than adhesives. The e-skin was made by embedding sensors on a thin film and then placing the film on a polyester backing, just like the one used in temporary tattoos. In July 2013, another team at the University of California, Berkeley was able to create an e-skin that lights up when touched and gets brighter as the pressure increases. Among the potential applications of the e-skin are being able to monitor the vitals of a patient. Others are a robot that will be able to detect disease or intoxication in a human and a video that can be played on the back of your hand.(source) 2. Li-Fi or Light Fidelity A high-speed wireless communication system that utilizes household LED light bulbs enabling data transfers 100 times faster than WiFi and reaching speeds of up to 224 gigabits per second.  Image Source: purelifi The term \u201cLi-Fi\u201d was coined by Harald Haas, a Chair Professor of Mobile Communications at the University of Edinburgh, Germany, and the co-founder pureLiFI, to describe the idea of \u201cwireless data from every light.\u201d Li-Fi works by switching the LED lights on and off at a very high rate, too quick for a human eye to notice, in order to transmit data. The advantage of using visible light over a normal WiFi\u2019s radio frequency is that the spectrum is 10,000 times larger and is expected to be ten times less expensive. Researchers were able to transmit data at a rate of 224 Gbits/second, quite a lot higher than the fastest broadband in 2013. Since light waves cannot penetrate the walls, Li-Fi is believed to be far more secure from hacking than WiFi. Li-Fi also does not require direct line of sight, and the light reflected off the walls can achieve speeds of 70 Mbits/s.(source) 3. Transparent Aluminum Armor A ceramic compound of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen known as aluminum oxynitride (AlON) that is optically transparent and four times harder than silica glass. A thickness of only 1.6 inches of AlON armor can stop .50 caliber BMG armor-piercing rounds which can penetrate 3.7 inches of glass laminate.  ALON (or AlON) is the hardest transparent ceramic available commercially. Because of its cubic spinel structure and by using conventional ceramic powder processing techniques, the material can be made into transparent windows, plates, domes, rods, tubes and many other forms. AlON is optically transparent, more than 80% so in the near-ultraviolet, visible, and midwave-infrared frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum. It is also four times harder than fused silica glass and 85% as hard as a sapphire. It can also withstand temperatures up to 2,100 degrees Centigrade. Being lightweight, hard, and transparent makes AlON an excellent candidate for bulletproof armor and has been shown to stop multiple armor-piercing projectiles of up to .50 caliber. It has also been nicknamed \u201ctransparent aluminum\u201d after a similar fictional material in the Star Trek universe. 4. Color-Changing Contact Lenses for Monitoring Glucose Levels The nanoparticles embedded in the hydrogel lenses react with the glucose molecules present in tears causing the lens to change color and thus alert the wearer of the rise or drop in their blood sugar levels.  Image Source: wikipedia One of the most important things a diabetic must do is to constantly monitor their blood sugar levels to avoid diabetes-related complications. But, every time they test their sugar levels they have to prick their finger to draw a drop of blood. The color-changing contact lenses designed by professor Jin Zhang from the University of Western Ontario can omit the need for drawing blood every day. When there is an increase or decrease in blood sugar levels, the tears and the urine are affected too. The lenses react to the glucose present in the tears and change color accordingly. The nanocomposites used in the lenses are believed to be useful in a wide variety of applications such as food preservation and biodegradable food packaging.(source) 5. Wireless Energy Transmission Japanese researchers have succeeded in transmitting energy using microwaves and delivered 1.8 kilowatts of power through the air, with pinpoint accuracy, to a receiver 55 meters away.  Image Source: NASA One of the foremost research projects at Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) has been solar power satellites (SPS), satellites which can harness the solar energy for use on Earth. The energy would then be transmitted to Earth using either lasers or microwaves. However, lasers are considered impractical as they do not work through clouds. Recently, JAXA was able to deliver 1.8 kilowatts of energy to an antenna known as rectenna 55 meters away using carefully directed microwaves. The conversion of solar energy to DC, then to microwave, to DC again, and finally AC is 80% efficient, without considering the loss of energy during transmission. The agency is planning on deploying a geosynchronous solar collector weighing 10,000 metric tons at around 36,000 kilometers from Earth. By 2031, JAXA hopes to have a one-gigawatt commercial pilot plant operational.(source) 6. Transparent Solar Panels These solar panesl allow visible light to pass thorugh and use ultravilet and infrared light to generate power instead.  Transparent luminescent solar concentrators (TLSC) or transparent solar panels were created at Michigan State University and are made of organic salts that absorb specific non-visible wavelengths. Usually, solar cells work by absorbing the light which creates a shadow as they cannot let the light pass through. But, TLSC gets around this problem by taking the ultraviolet and infrared light and \u201cluminescing\u201d them as another wavelength of infrared light. This new infrared light is guided to and collected at the edges where thin strips of conventional photovoltaic solar cells are present. The current prototype has an efficiency of around 1%, but scientists believe efficiency of 10% and above should be possible soon.(source) 7. Femto-Photography Researchers at MIT have created a new imaging system that can acquire visual data at a rate of one trillion exposures per second, fast enough to capture light traveling the length of a one-liter bottle. A research team at the MIT Media Lab led by Ramesh Raskar in collaboration with Graphics and Imaging Lab at the Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain has developed a technique for recording the propagation of very short pulses of light. This technique known as femto-photography uses a streak camera synchronized to a pulsed laser which is modified to capture 2D images instead of just recording a single scan line. According to Raskar and his team, they were able to capture exposures so short that light only travels 0.6 millimeters (which takes it 2 picoseconds or 2 x 10-12 seconds to travel) during that period. Another interesting achievement of the femto-photography is being able to reconstruct unknown objects around corners, that is objects that are outside the line of sight of the light source or camera.(source) 8. 5D Glass Discs Researchers from the UK have created glass discs that can record data in five dimensions and keep it safe for up to 13.8 billion years. The discs can store 360 terabytes of data and can even withstand temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Centigrade.  Image Source: southampton In 2013, scientists at the University of Southampton, UK succeeded in demonstrating a method they refer to as \u201cfive-dimensional data storage.\u201d On a normal CD, the data is stored by creating bumps which are then read by a laser, a bump being read as one and the lack of a bump read as zero. This makes a CD two dimensional. On the other hand, a 5D disc stores information within its interior through tiny physical structures called \u201cnanogratings.\u201d Just like the bumps on a CD, these nanogratings are read using light. The five dimensions, in this case, are the three-dimensional location of the grating (that is the x-, y-, and z-axes), the strength of the light the nanograting refracts, and its orientation. These extra dimensions help the disc store data much more densely compared to a CD. Currently, a Blu-ray Disc can hold up to 128 gigabytes of data, while a 5D disc of the same size can store almost 3,000 times more, that is 360 terabytes of data.(source) 9. Synthetic \u201cLeaf\u201d that Produces Oxygen The synthetic, biological leaf made by suspending chloroplasts in a silk protein matrix absorbs water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen just like a plant and could enable long-distance space travel.  Image Source: julianmelchiorri With the prospect of interplanetary travel becoming a reality, NASA has been researching ways to produce oxygen for long-distance journeys and to make living in space much easier. Julian Melchiorri, a graduate of the Royal College of Art\u2019s Innovation Design Engineering course, in collaboration with Tufts University silk lab, has created one such device which he named \u201cMelchiorri\u2019s Silk Leaf.\u201d He believes that the fibers of silk have \u201can amazing property of stabilizing molecules.\u201d So, he extracted chloroplasts from plant cells and placed them inside a matrix of that silk protein. Just like normal leaves, it requires light and some water to produce oxygen. He believes it could enable long-distance space travel by producing enough oxygen to breathe.(source) 10. Aerogel A synthetic, porous, ultralight material made from a gel from which the liquid component is replaced with gas. Extremely strong and thermally insulating, an aerogel block heated up to 2,200 degrees Centigrade can be held with the bare hands without burning the skin.  Image credit: NASA Also known as \u201cfrozen smoke,\u201d \u201csolid air,\u201d or \u201csolid cloud,\u201d aerogel is a solid with an extremely low density and thermal conductivity. It can be made from a variety of chemical compounds. In the beginning, it was made using silica gels. Now, however, there are aerogels based on carbon, alumina, chromia, and tin dioxide. The liquid component of the gel is extracted through supercritical drying. This process allows it to dry slowly enough for the solid matrix to stay intact instead of collapsing from capillary action. Almost 99.8% of the material is air, and it has a porous solid network with air pockets that take up a majority of its volume. The material feels fragile to the touch and is almost weightless because of the air pockets. However, it is so strong that a 2.5-kilogram brick can be supported by a piece of 2 grams of aerogel. It is also a viable candidate for providing thermal insulation for spaceships.(source) Pleae do Upvote & Share if you like !!! ",

(Touchskreen, Virtual Reality e.t.c) So, lets go through some of the coolest inventions! 3d printers.If you have never used the 3d printer or 3d pen - you have lost an amazing experience! Just imagine: anything you could imagine (and model in 3Ds Max =) ) will become real!In my opinion one of the coolest startups connected with 3d printing is Obsidian 3D printer. This project is making its first steps. Nevertheless, if the developers will make everything they promise at the Kickstarter, this thing is going to be hot!Cameras and glasses, controlled by eyes.Many of you, possibly have heard about the Google Glass, but the truth is the fact that the project have failed. But the idea itself is amazing - this is the future we have seen in the cinema and read about in Sci-Fi books!One more interesting project is Blincam.Some cool stuff about it: Attach to eye glassesBecause it attaches to any pair of eye glasses, you can save what you see, anytime anywhere. WINK to shutterBlincam distinguishes strong wink or blink from natural ones so all you have to do is to WINK the shutter on your intention. Hands FreeNo need to use hands to take pictures. All you have to do is just to give a wink, or a blink.VRThere are huge amount of cool VR projects, there are some of them:3D modelling in VR Great shooter game (Made with Unreal Engine 4 - game engine which provides an amazing graphics!)Muscle impulse gestures controllersThis is an AMAZING stuff for games presentations and interactive communication with your gadgets! How it works: When you are creating an impulse to move your hand or fingers different muscles are involved. So, Myo may recognize which muscles exactly you use and provide different controls!Myo will be the best opportunity if you want to know what future will be like!It may be used with most popular presentations software, you may use it like a mouse in PC, and also play with hyrocopters and, I am sure, in future we will be able to play realistic video games with that band!",

Most people don\u2019t know it\u2019s there. 79% of web sites that you visit run Linux (that goes up to 97% if you only count the million most-popular sites). 498 of the 500 fastest computers in the world run Linux. Most people don\u2019t know it\u2019s there. But I\u2019m a Linux nut - I use it on my main computer and my laptop every day\u2026so I fondly imagine that I know about these things. But no. I own 4 TV sets - and the other day, I needed to actually read the instruction book\u2026on the back page, I noticed a page with \u201cOpen Source Licenses\u201d listed on it\u2026which is good because if you use OpenSource libraries, you\u2019re required to say so someplace. Guess what? All four of my TVs run Linux! I literally had no idea. So then I started to look at other instruction books. Turns out my dishwasher and my wife\u2019s car both run Linux\u2026probably other things that I didn\u2019t keep the instructions for - and things made by companies who don\u2019t bother to tell you to, too. Because small/cheap computers cost less than the price of a MacOS or Windows software license, almost all of IoT (Internet of Things) devices that need an OS at all, will be running Linux\u2026because it\u2019s free and it works very well indeed. I know someone whose front door bell runs Linux. The Linux kernel contains 20 million lines of code. About 10,000 people have contributed code to it (I\u2019m proud to be one of them) - and it\u2019s FREE. This is an astounding piece of technology - yet even the people who wrote it are often completely unaware that it\u2019s slipped quietly into some other odd corner of their lives - quietly making things better - rarely taking credit.

            "answer_text": "This may seem like a trite answer compared to some in this thread, but it was somewhat of an epiphany to me when I adjusted my perspective. In fact I suspect it will be the most transformative technology going into the far future. Broadly speaking it is advanced nanotechnology that uses molecular assemblers to build all manner of complex objects, structures and devices. The technologies will be programmed using molecular codes and will be capable of manufacturing materials and objects with molecular precision. Key aspects will be the ability to self-repair and self-replicate using only simple raw materials as feed stock. This might sound like wishful thinking and overly speculative if it were not for the abundance of evidence of what this technology is capable. We call this evidence, life. Life is the best example of what advanced nanotechnology will be capable of. Currently it is only controlled by a mindless optimization algorithm, which we refer to as natural selection, or evolution. However, once we understand the DNA code and are able to write this code as we would code any software, we could finally unlock this transformative technology. To be clear, life serves as a proof of concept only. Natural selection only drives evolution towards efficient collection and utilisation of available resources. We already have many examples of exotic materials that are fabricated by life. If this technology were to be subject to intelligent design with different resource feed stock, it would open possibilities that would stretch our imagination. We as a technological society have been only at this for a hundred years or so. What people thought of as advanced technology fifty years ago, is now only of historical significance. The pace of technological growth is approximately exponential. Just the example of our rapid pace of technological progress should serve as an example of how incomprehensible future technologies will become. The natural world has given us a fantastic place to start to understand how nanotechnology can be made to work for us. Every living thing is a functioning nanomachine that started with just a single cell that gathered resources and assembled itself according to a molecular code. It also serves as an example of how different technologies can be. Our brains are tremendous learning machines that look nothing like the CPUs found in modern computers. We are making progress in developing the tools for modifying the DNA code, such as the recently developed CRISPR technique. However, what we'd ideally like is to have an interpretive coding language that can convert our designs into the DNA code. We are a long way from that. However, progress in machine learning applied to complex research tasks may one day crack that nut. In fact, the development of advanced artificial intelligence and deep learning may be the key to unlocking the nanotechnology of life so that it becomes the technology of the future. ",

Its discovery resulted in the Nobel Prize for Physics being given \u201cfor groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.\u201d Graphene is classified as two-dimensional: it is one atom thick (not pure two-dimensional but as close as we can come) and this form creates several fascinating properties.  So why hasn\u2019t this material exploded? It\u2019s so useful, it could make phones last a week, charge in seconds, and could provide unbelievable body armor. Well, unfortunately, producing it large scale is super hard. Peeling down graphite on a nanoscale to one atom thick is incredibly hard since just interacting with atoms at that level is nearly impossible. Being unable to stack it quickly, atom by atom, is still the only reason why graphene hasn\u2019t radically altered our lives. Further, we still haven\u2019t been able to use it as a super capacitor. If we are able to do so, everything will change extremely quickly and this could become a massive technological leap. Eventually, someone is going to discover how to create graphene quickly\u2026 and when they do, I\u2019d recommend investing. It isn\u2019t every day that a trillion dollar market is created. ",

            "answer_text": "Ever seen light beam passing by in super slow motion? Check out this video  You see the light beam passing through the Coke bottle, it takes only 1/1,000,000,000,000 second for the light beam to reach the far end of the bottle. The entire video is captured with trillion frames per second configuration which gives us an opportunity to see the light beam passing inside the bottle right in front of us as if some object is travelling at a slow speed. The device has been developed by the MIT Media Lab's Camera Culture group in collaboration with Bawendi Lab in the Department of Chemistry at MIT. A laser pulse that lasts less than one trillionth of a second is used as a flash and the light returning from the scene is collected by a camera at a rate equivalent to roughly 1 trillion frames per second. However, due to very short exposure times (roughly one trillionth of a second) and a narrow field of view of the camera, the video is captured over several minutes by repeated and periodic sampling. Some fun fact about this video is, had it been a bullet instead of the light beam, then it\u2019d take roughly one year to see the bullet reaching the other end of the coke bottle! \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Disclaimer: Okay I get it, there are already couple of mentions about the Vantablack in this thread so you can skip this point, but do check out the edited picture of cloudgate of chicago & USAF X-24A , it\u2019s kinda amazing. :D You see this element? It\u2019s called Vantablack and it\u2019s the blackest possible substance on the planet earth that absorbs 99.96% of light. It\u2019s made of carbon nano tubes aligned vertically. The piece of aluminum foil shown here is creased, wrinkled, in a random fashion before being coated with Vantablack on one side. But as we can see the surface appears as either a completely flat black surface or simply a void. The almost total lack of light reflected from the Vantablack surface prevents the eye detecting any surface detail.  \u200b Image Source: CNN \u201cLight energy striking the Vantablack surface enters the space between the nanotubes and is rapidly absorbed as it \u2018bounces\u2019 from tube to tube and simply cannot escape as the tubes are so long in relation to their diameter and the space between them. The near total lack of reflectance creates an almost perfect black surface. To understand this effect, try to visualise walking through a forest in which the trees are around 3km tall instead of the usual 10 to 20 metres. It\u2019s easy to imagine just how little light, if any, would reach you.\u201d It\u2019s so dark that it can turn anything into abyss, you cant see the shape of the object and neither gauge the depth. It\u2019s all black TARS, do you read me? See the picture below, this is how the the cloudgate in Chicago will look like if painted with this substance, it feels like there\u2019s a hole in earth opening somewhere in deep space.  \u200b Image Source: Google Or even more interesting, just imagine an aircraft coated with Vantablack!  \u200b Image Source: USAF Facebook Page For more details about this substance, you can visit Surrey NanoSystems. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- Nike\u2019s self tying shoes, The HyperAdapt 1.0.

Imagine its a hot summers day and there is no cold water in the house, now in seconds, you can have that cold beverage that you require. Although I do not know how exactly it works it is claimed to be able to chill an entire bottle of drink in 45 seconds. Drink Driving Band This device sits on your wrist and has the ability to detect when you\u2019 re too drunk to drive. For now, this is just on your wrist but think about what else this could do, we could integrate this technology with cars and therefore wouldn\u2019t allow you to start the car well you\u2019re drunk. One invention that could significantly reduce the number of deaths on the road caused by drink driving. Another use for the technology could be for teenagers, they could wear this and it would tell them when they are getting too drunk, which would help with problems such as alcohol poisoning which is especially in the younger generation. eBays HeadGaze This little invention allows you to control apps on your smartphones by moving your head. This could change the way we interact with smartphones, instead of using touch input or voice input as we have we now have a third option. Imagine just sitting down and being able to answer a text or any other activity with just your head. Other applications for this technology include helping those with disabilities, eventually, this might allow them to have as close as possible to a normal life. These are some of the coolest technology that I have seen recently. If you would like to know more about the future or technology click here. ",

It\u2019s the thinnest material physically possible. - It\u2019s also incredibly flexible, an amazing conductor, a perfect barrier, and 200 times stronger than steel. There\u2019s applications in almost every field. - It helps accelerate stem cell growth. It can be used as an effective biosensor, and used to detect cancer. It can be used for cancer therapy, by delivering drugs to the cancerous cells. It could possibly solve a problem with DNA sequencing. It\u2019s possible that graphene transistors could make computers 1000 times faster. Graphene membranes exclusively let through water vapor, and can be used to revolutionize biofuel. They can be incorporated in solar cells, giving a 60% increase in efficiency. Lithium-ion batteries built with graphene will be far more efficient than what we currently have. It can be used as an effective de-salinator for salt-water. - And that\u2019s just a few of the applications. There are literally thousands. The reason it isn\u2019t incredibly popular, is because production costs are still very high. But once graphene becomes cheap, and widely available, it\u2019s going to explode. This is going to change your life more than any politician. This is going to create an entire new breed of electronics. The possibilities are practically limitless. Get ready world.  ",

            "answer_text": "Today morning, while doing a workout in the gym I was listening to music on FM. After few songs, the Radio jockey was telling the national news and she told that the Prime Minister of Israel is in India for a week-long trip and he is going to gift something special to our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I got curious about this gift. As soon I reached my office I googled it and the result is amazing. Here's what Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu will gift his 'friend' Modi: the Gal-Mobile water desalinization and purification jeep. Gal-Mobile is an independent, integrated water purification vehicle, designed to produce high-quality drinking water. It can be useful in natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, military use in difficult terrain and rural areas to provide drinkable water. It can purify up to 20,000 litres per day of seawater and 80,000 litres per day of brackish/muddy or contaminated river water and bring it to WHO standards. The jeep is said to cost around 390,000 shekels (approximately $1,11,000).  We all know that the entire world is suffering due to pollution and one of its major outburst is Water scarcity. If we can purify Mud water or seawater, then we can solve this issue of water scarcity. For me, this vehicle is a miracle. Just imagine how useful it can be during natural disasters. Most of the countries have their own water purifier plants this technology is not new but this tiny movable jeep is just wow. It can do a lot within less time and we can carry it to all remote places to help the needy ones. Cheers for Technology!!!!! Being Indian I would like to thank Israel for this gesture and gift. For more information: GALMOBILE | GAL Keep reading and Keep Learning. Thank you so much for your time. See you soon.

            "answer_text": "Virtual Reality BUT in a different way than you think.  Virtual Reality has been two words that\u2019s been flying around in the last few years and everyone is super excited about it. If I said to you - what do you think virtual reality is used for? You\u2019re probably going to say something like in games or media. What if I told you it\u2019s used to help someone walk again?  I had the pleasure of meeting Jordan Nguyen recently and he told me an amazing story of the power of virtual reality. Angus McConnell (above photo) has a c7 spinal cord injury. This means he can\u2019t move his legs and doctors say he will never walk again. After several years of \u2018normal\u2019 treatment - there was no results. Cue - Virtual Reality. After using virtual reality for some time (I\u2019ll be honest and say Jordan said half a year but I am not 100% sure so I will leave that blank) through simulations such as climbing a mountain, an amazing thing happened. He started to move his legs on his own. He also started to feel something, very tiny, but something around his legs. Eventually something even more amazing happened. With support from the team, he managed to stand. Yup stand! When I asked Jordan how this was possible, even he didn\u2019t have an answer. He predicts it\u2019s some crazy extreme version of the placebo effect but there is still no 100% answer. The amazing thing is that Virtual Reality is not just for games or movies - it\u2019s much more than that! For other interesting content - check out my blog :) ",

You can tell what movie anyone is watching by looking at the electricity signature.  Let me explain what I mean  With the help of smart meters, we can sample the electricity usage to tell us how much electricity is being used an any instant of time. As you can see above, the resolution is not very high. The sampling would be more like 1 per minute. However, if we reduce it to say 1 per milli second, the signature we get can really be powerful and can be used to identify what movie anyone is watching.  You can read more about this here: Smart meter hacking can disclose which TV shows and movies you watch  The implication of this can be huge in the future. While we can argue that our privacy will be affected, law enforcement agencies will argue that they can find out if anyone is watching any illegal videos / movies without having to go into a location.  This can also affect insurance premiums, etc. While the technology is there, there are quite a few barriers that need to be overcome before we see this being commonly used. *** Added later *** See Also: Your Outlet Knows: How Smart Meters Can Reveal Behavior at Home, What We Watch on TV https://epic.org/privacy/smartgrid/smart_meter.pdf ",

It\u2019s simply a monster elevator, capable of lifting multiple thousands of tons (water + cargo ship + load). The picture is of a Belgian one, but there are tens around the world. What is astonishing to me is a little \u201chack\u201d that is used to make it work. Ships of any size can pass through it from half ton to 2 thousands tons, and a single ship can be loaded or not. How can this support such wide range of weights? Is it just a powerful engine?  Actually, the engine is capable of much less push and in a much narrower range. It has dead weights, like any other elevator, so that the engine must \u201cjust\u201d be able to move a pulley. But the \u201cmiracle\u201d is based on a principle well known for thousands of years: Archimedes\u2019 principle. The main tank being lifted contains water other than the ship(s). The water level is always constant as it is the same of the river. So how do the control the weight of the ships entering? Simple: they don\u2019t. Whether one ship, no ships or two fully loaded ships enter, the weight is always constant. How it is so? Because of Archimedes\u2019 principle: the ships will push out as much water as their weight and, since a river can be approximated to \u201cabsorb\u201d any quantity of water (i.e. even if the whole amount of water in the tank were poured into the river, the level would not raise as negligible), the water level inside the chamber will stay the same and therefore also the weight. Regardless one, two, one hundred or no ships are inside! In the end it is a simple principle but it is great how this is used to greatly simplify a mechanism that would have been otherwise incredibly clumsy and complicated. If you want to make a simple experiment to prove the mechanism: fill a bucket up to a certain level; mark the level; weigh the bucket. Now put in the bucket a floating object of any given weight (i.e. your ship) and remove as much water as necessary to keep the level at the marker (the river does it automagically). Weigh again. Is the weight any different than before? (hint: it\u2019s not :-) ) ",

            "answer_text": "In the world of countless technologies, it would be a biased decision to pick just a particular technology. So, I have listed down some of the technologies that are mind-blowing and certainly not many people know about it: #1 Synthetic leaf that produces Oxygen  The synthetic leave is created from a matrix of protein extracted from silk and chloroplasts which absorbs water and carbon dioxide that allows it to perform photosynthesis and hence produce oxygen just like any other plant. It is very light and low energy-consuming. It was developed by Julian Melchiorri, a graduate of the Royal College of Art\u2019s Innovation Design Engineering course, in collaboration with Tufts University silk lab and named it \u201cMelchiorri\u2019s Silk Leaf\u201d. He believes his invention can enable long-distance space travel by producing enough oxygen to breath. #2 Color-changing Contact Lenses for Monitoring Glucose Level  The major issue for a diabetic person is to constantly measure his blood sugar level to avoid any complications related to the disease. But, a diabetic person has to draw a drop of blood in order to do so. However, not with the help of these hydrogel lenses that have nanoparticles which reacts with the glucose molecules present in tears causing the lens to change its colour and thus it can simply tell the individual the rise and drop in sugar levels by the colour of the lens. #3 Transparent Solar Panels  Developed at Michigan State University, made of organic salts that absorb specific non-visible wavelengths. These solar panels use ultraviolet and infrared rays to generate energy and allow the visible light to pass through it. The conventional solar cells absorb the light which creates a shadow as they cannot let the light pass through. But, Transparent Solar Panels doesn\u2019t work the same way as it takes the ultraviolet and infrared light and \u201cluminescent\u201d them as another wavelength of infrared light. Then that infrared light is guided to the other end and collected at the edges where thin strips of conventional photo-voltaic solar cells are present. #4 Personal Neuro Devices  Personal neuro devices are one of the latest inventions that are used to calm a human brain by changing the frequency of the brain waves using electromagnetic impulses. The device can detect the behavior of the brain in different situations and how a person reacts to it. One can choose the state of mind and body that one prefers the most or can allow the device to suggest how the mind should behave. #5 Solar Power Satellite  A solar power satellite (SPS) is capable of storing energy and transmit it to earth via lasers or microwaves. Recently, JAXA (Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency) had successfully been able to transmit 1.8 kilowatts of energy to an antenna. JAXA is planning on deploying a geosynchronous solar collector weighing 10,000 metric tons at around 36,000 kilometers from Earth. That\u2019s it! Do let me know which of these you found interesting or were familiar with before as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Mercedes-Benz promised to come to CES with a vision of the automobile of the future, and the German manufacturer has not disappointed. The new concept, which has been christened the Vision AVTR (for \"Advanced Vehicle Transformation\"), was developed in direct collaboration with the team responsible for the \"Avatar\" saga, including its director James Cameron.  The goal, announced by Mercedes, is not only to have the driver merge with the automobile but also to combine the interior and exterior of the vehicle into an \"emotional whole,\" which is in harmony with the surrounding world. With this in mind, the styling of the concept has adopted a design language that Mercedes describes as \"organic.\"  Inside the vehicle, for example, there is no steering wheel but a large centre console that can recognize all of the auto's occupants when they place their hands on it. Via this contact, the concept can take the pulse of all of its passengers and adjust the atmosphere in the interior in accordance. For their part, fans of the film will also appreciate the concept's \"immersive experience space,\" which enables them to directly enter the universe of the saga with images that are projected in 3D.  It should be noted that a multitude of \"bionic flaps\" reminiscent of reptile scales, which are installed on the roof of the vehicle, is designed to communicate with the driver and \"with their outside world through naturally flowing movements,\" and that the decoration of the passenger compartment is inspired by the Na'vi dwellings in \"Avatar.\"  Finally, in what is perhaps the most surprising innovation, the vehicle, which is equipped with spherical wheels can not only move straight ahead but also laterally and diagonally. As for the engine, Mercedes has opted for a 350 kW motor, offering the equivalent of more than 475 hp, and a range of up to 700 km thanks to the vehicle's innovative graphene batteries.  In short, with the Vision AVTR, it is increasingly difficult to judge where reality ends and fiction begins. Upvotes will be appreciated. ",

Dna data storage/bacteria storage Harvard researchers have successfully encoded a five-frame GIF into the DNA of living E. coli bacteria. The new method could lead to a more stable, long-term data storage than silicon memory. Just one gram of data-storing bacteria could hold the same amount of data as up to 450, 2,000 GB hard drives.   Edible robots Scientist created tiny edible and digestible robots made of gelatin filled with air or fluid or react to chemicals, capable of moving along the body internally. These robots may be used to deliver medicines in the intestinal tract or move around to help provide stability where needed.  Broadband over power lines AT&T developed a new way to offer broadband Internet service over utility electric power lines, AirGig which could make it cheaper and easier to bring broadband connectivity to more remote areas that already have electricity wires. The technique could also be used to improve coverage in its existing 4G network or upcoming 5G network.  Li fi Light Fidelity is a Visible Light Communications system running wireless communications travelling at very high speeds. Li-Fi uses common household LED light bulbs to enable data transfer(100 times faster then Wifi), boasting speeds of up to 224 gigabits per second.  Augmented reality Augmented reality, blurs the line between what's real and what's computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell. It is closer to the real world. Augmented reality adds graphics, sounds, haptic feedback and smell to the natural world as it exists.  Hyperloop With Virgin Hyperloop One, passengers and cargo will be loaded into a pod, and accelerate gradually via electric propulsion through a low-pressure tube. The pod quickly lifts above the track using magnetic levitation and glides at airline speeds for long distances due to ultra-low aerodynamic drag.  Quantum Computing With the new quantum computing governments could pinpoint exactly which roads need to be upgraded to minimize gridlock, leading to more efficient and effective use of tax revenue. Reducing the number of traffic jams which would further decrease air pollution, potentially alleviating asthma and reducing our contributions to climate change.  Witricity -wireless electricity Moving on to the new era of wireless electricity, delivering wireless power at a distance to any device transforming the way we live, work and move.

            "answer_text": "Vagus Nerve Stimulator (VNS). It\u2019s used to help control and prevent epileptic seizures in people who have uncontrolled epilepsy. It\u2019s often referred to as a \u201cpacemaker for the brain\u201d. I had the surgery for this implant last year. I had never heard of it, and I have found that most never have either. Which is a shame, because it\u2019s an amazing piece of technology that should receive more recognition. What it does. The implant sends regular, mild pulses of electrical energy to the brain via the vagus nerve, it\u2019s placed under the skin and attached to the chest wall and a wire runs from it to the vagus nerve in the neck. The vagus nerve is part of the autonomic nervous system, which controls functions of the body that are not under voluntary control, such as the heart rate. The vagus nerve passes through the neck as it travels between the chest and abdomen and the lower part of the brain. The battery/generator usually lasts 5\u201310 years, or less, depending on your programmed settings. How to use it. A few weeks after surgery (it was about five weeks for me), the device will be programmed by your neurologist or neurosurgeon. It\u2019s programmed to send electrical pulses at regular intervals, such as on for seven seconds and off for five minutes. And, gradually increased until it meets your needs. Then the auto-stimulation is programmed, it\u2019s set to send a higher pulse, and it automatically uses that higher pulse when it senses the beginning of a seizure and when your heart rate spikes a certain percent withing a few nano seconds. Then the magnet settings are programmed, which is used by your friends, family and yourself when a seizure occurs. It\u2019s set at a higher pulse than the auto-stim and often lasts longer. It has helped me quite a bit. It has prevented 20\u201343 seizures a day. And, as a precaution, I use the magnet on myself three times a day to help keep my brain\u2019s electrical \u201csystem\u201d from synchronizing (that\u2019s when seizures occur). My normal cycle is 30 seconds every 90 seconds. My auto-stim cycles 45 seconds. My magnet cycles 60 seconds. All of there electrical pulse settings are different. ",

It is basically a smart-tumbler, and is capable of automatically identifying the beverage inside and measure its nutritional properties with some combination of (currently undisclosed) sensors. For instance, it is able to measure the sugar, protein, fat and caffeine content of coffee and even the calorie count of your own homemade mix. Linked to a large database of known commercial beverages, its accuracy in identifying drinks is remarkable. Harnessing this information, the companion phone/watch application (or the native Health app in iPhone to which it is linked) records and monitors hydration levels and reminds the user to hydrate in order to reach his/her Pryme (the user\u2019s progress to his/her Pryme is also displayed by its characteristic vertical Pryme bar that automatically illuminates in the same familiar fashion as the Apple Watch), a term coined by the makers to represent the optimal levels of hydration. You can read a review by The Verge here: Vessyl is the smart cup that knows exactly what you're drinking.    Although it was originally planned to be released in early 2015, the first release of Vessyl has been delayed. Its sister the Pryme Vessyl, which lacks the smart detection feature, is currently available commercially. It has received some negative reviews and comes at a rather hefty price though. The Pryme Vessyl smart cup is a useless tool for tracking how much water you drink.  Here is the official website of Vessyl. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a real jetpack designed by JetPack Technology called the JP-9 that truly lives up to the universal archetype. Unlike the Martin Jetpack which is actually a gasoline powered piston engine that drives ducted fans and is impossible for a wearer to carry, the JB-9 is powered by a real jet engine that is compact and light enough to wear like a backpack and fit in the smallest of car trunks. It made it\u2019s maiden flight around the statue of liberty last November and it was so small, smooth and simple that is was difficult to believe it was real. But it was and is real! Here\u2019s an excerpt from a recent Fortune Magazine article. The JB-9, in contrast to the Martin, runs scaled-down versions of the same kind of jet engines that drive a 747 or F-16. Unlike the old Bell-Williams device, it\u2019s light enough to be carried by a wearer on foot, and small enough to fit into the back seat of a car. The JB-9 also runs on a range of fuels, including diesel and kerosene. Mayman says most of the JB-9\u2019s performance advantages are thanks to recent advances in jet engine technology. There is still that eternal question of the jetpack\u2014how do you not burn your legs? \u201cIt\u2019s really not hot,\u201d insists Mayman. \u201cI could fly in shorts.\u201d That\u2019s because the exhaust mixes with ambient air almost immediately. Another advantage of the \u2018pure\u2019 jetpack is its performance in high winds and turbulence. \u201cWe have no wings, so when we fly into 30 or 40 mile per hour winds, we hardly feel it.\u201d All of that makes the JB-9, at the very least, the first jetpack with potential practical applications. Mayman is particularly keen to see it in the hands of emergency responders, who could travel several miles over rough terrain much more easily than in a helicopter. I don\u2019t think jetpacks will be the future of travel for most of us but it\u2019s a marvel to see it fly. Want to see a piece of the future we were promised for yourself? Here\u2019s some video of the NYC test flight last November.  ",
