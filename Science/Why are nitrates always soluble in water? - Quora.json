            "answer_text": "In order for a substance to dissolve in water, two things have to be true: The molecules/ions in the substance have to be more attracted to the water molecules than they are to each other, andThe water molecules have to be more attracted to the molecules/ions in the substance than they are to each other.Nitrate ions are made of three oxygen atoms bonded to a central nitrogen atom. Owing to the high electronegativity of oxygen, the electron density in a nitrate ion tends to be decentralized. The hydrogen atom of a nearby water molecule \u2014 being mostly devoid of electron density \u2014 will find itself strongly attracted to the electron-rich oxygen atoms of a nitrate ion. Consequently, criterion #2 is met; the water molecules are more strongly attracted to nitrate ions than they are to each other. But wait a minute! Carbonate ions have just as many oxygen atoms as nitrate ions, and phosphate ions have more oxygen atoms. Shouldn\u2019t carbonates and phosphates be just as soluble, if not more soluble than nitrates? Carbonate and phosphate ions have charges of 2- and 3-, respectively. As a result of their greater negative charge, they are more strongly attracted to their cations, which makes them more difficult to separate. Nitrate ions have only a single negative charge, meaning they feel less attraction for their cation partners. Keep in mind that among the carbonates and phosphates, only those with monovalent alkali metal cations tend to be water-soluble. Since the nitrate ion bears less negative charge, however, most of its salts are soluble. ",

            "answer_text": "The negative charge of the nitrate ion is delocalized over four centres. And this can be appreciated by simple Lewis structures of the nitrate anion which features THREE formal charges. [math]O=\\stackrel{+}N(-O^{-})_{2}[/math] Of course, the charges are distributed around the molecule by resonance\u2026 As a result, nitrate is not a particularly active or charge dense anion, and it\u2019s solubility is enhanced while its reactivity is reduced. Nitrates tend to have solubilty in organic phases, however, its potential to oxidize is unmasked here, and it tends not be used as a precursor in these phases. ",
