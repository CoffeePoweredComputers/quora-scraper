            "answer_text": "If you are referring to rock like basalt, the polygons are caused by 2000 degree magma covering the surface and then over a long period of time the magma cools. As it cools it shrinks and this shrinking occurs vertically as the lava parts it forms what are known as columnar basalt structures. If you are talking about crystallography then the shape is due to the atomic structure repeating patterns as it crystalizes. ",
