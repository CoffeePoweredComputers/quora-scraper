            "answer_text": "If you think of the force balance at the meniscus, I can\u2019t see of any other reason than impurities/roughness in the surface. These will \u201chold\u201d the meniscus as long as the droplet is light enough and the impurity is large enough. I did an experiment, after noticing the water droplets that got stuck in my shower glass door. I thoroughly cleaned a part of the door, and both the quantity and size of droplets that got stuck diminished dramatically. Instead most droplets run down very quickly. In the dirtier parts of the door, many droplets of larger sizes got stuck. This actually makes sense, as the impurities/roughness of the surface can be taken as causing a form of static friction, which makes the water not roll, just like other things don\u2019t roll on sloping surfaces if the friction is high enough. The interesting thing about water is that it works for surfaces with sloping angle equal and greater than 90 degrees, because water tends to want to stay stuck to the surface. Edit: I have found a few papers that look at this and agree with what I said, like this one: http://fluids.snu.ac.kr/Publication/sliding.pdf . Basically, when drops don\u2019t fall it\u2019s due to the contact angle hysteresis, which causes differences between receding and advancing contact angles. Drops start falling \u201c when the energy barrier due to a defect is overcome\u201d, i.e. they don\u2019t fall because of defects. ",
