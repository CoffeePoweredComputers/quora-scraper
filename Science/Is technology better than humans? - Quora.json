            "answer_text": "Technology means invention of tools and technologies by humans, that aims to assist us, help us do tasks with more efficiency, speed and accuracy. Humans have designed technology to help accomplish tasks that are mundane, or riskier, faster and more accurately. It is therefore designed to perform better than humans. Take an example of a note counting machine, a person and machine can both count notes, but the task done using technology is achieved much faster and more accurately.In the end I would say Technology is better than humans but it is a product of human and can become irrelevant, but the human mind would definitely not.
