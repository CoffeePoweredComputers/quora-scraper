            "answer_text": "In everyday use, heat is spoken of as a type of substance. That works well when you're thinking of solids and liquids that are fairly incompressible, so that it\u2019s difficult to do any mechanical work on them by compressing them. Thus, any 'heat\u2019 you put in has to come out as heat. However, more generally, it's better to imagine heat as an event: it's energy arriving in leaving a body by thermal means as opposed to mechanical work. That covers cases like the refrigerant in your fridge, where, over the course of the cycle, the refrigerator is doing net work on it (by compressing it and then letting it expand at a lower temperature), and having it eject net heat (by contriving that it absorbs a small amount of heat from the contents of the fridge and ejects a large amount of heat through the radiator at the back of the fridge). Against that background, infrared light is heat to the extent that it represents \"thermal means\". That's true in the common case that the infrared light is approximate Black-body radiation emitted by a warm object. As Barak Shoshany has pointed out in a separate answer, the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is almost entirely infrared. Even objects that are \"red-hot\" or \u201cwhite-hot\u201d emit a little bit of radiation in the visible spectrum, but a lot more in the infrared.  However the significance of black body radiation is less that it's what an ideal black body radiates and more that it's what it means for light itself to have a temperature in the first place. If you let light come to thermal equilibrium with any object at all (black or otherwise) it ends up with a \"black body\" spectrum. That means, according to the Zeroth law of thermodynamics , it has the same temperature as the (black or otherwise) body. It just comes to equilibrium faster (in exactly one bounce) if the object is perfectly black. Another way of saying that light has a well-defined temperature is that it's in a state of maximum entropy. Black-body radiation is maximally disordered. So if the infrared radiation was emitted by warm object and is approximately black body radiation then it constitutes \"thermal means\" and you may as well say that it\u2019s heat. On the other hand, if the infrared is very different from black body radiation, for example, if it's the output of a Carbon dioxide laser , where all the energy is concentrated in a wavelength range between 9.4 and 10.6 micrometres, then it's more complicated. In principle, such narrow-band infrared is equivalent to mechanical work, because it's less disordered. So if you warm up an object with a CO2 laser, it's really a two-step process: first you\u2019re degrading high-quality energy to thermal energy and then you\u2019re heating up the object. ",

            "answer_text": "To add a few details to Barak Shoshany's generally excellent answer, \"heat\" is a short form for the energy stored in vibrations of electrically excited atoms and molecules. An object that is \"hotter\" than it's surroundings is at a higher state of excitation on the atomic and molecular level than it's surroundings. Temperature is the average level of excitation of an object. Now part of thermodynamics is that differentials between adjacent places in terms of concentrations of energy tend to even out. So the hot objects radiate some of this energy away in the form of light. How it works on the sub-atomic level is that when electrons in atoms or in molecular bonds drop down to a lower energy state, they give off the difference in a little package of light energy. When one of these packagee hits an electron on another nearby object, it can be absorbed, raising the energy level of vibration, and adding to the heat of that object. Different energies of these packages, called photons, correspond to different frequencies. Different frequencies correspond to different colors, or places in the Electromagnetic spectrum. Hot objects will be radiating massive numbers of these photons at various energies. It'll form a distribution, like heights of students in a classroom or salaries of people in a country. These distributions for hot objects are vaguely but not exactly bell-shaped. They have a peak. A branch of thermodynamics called statistical mechanics predicts these shapes and experiment confirms. The peak of the distribution is at a frequency that depends on the temperature according to the Wien's Law that Barak mentions. For objects at close to room temperature, as already stated, these peaks are in the infrared region of the EM spectrum. So I guess, to answer the question more simply, infrared radiation is the means through which heat is transferred from objects at around room temperature. ",

            "answer_text": "Infrared radiation like all radiation is a 'substance' which can transfer energy through empty space. In particular infrared radiation is electromagnetic radiation which has a wavelength longer than visible light but shorter than radio waves. Before talking about heat we need to look at the physical manifestation of temperature. Temperature is a measure of how fast the molecules which make up an object are moving. In the case of a gas they fly about all over the place and for objects and liquids they vibrate on the spot. The faster they fly about or vibrate the hotter they are. The molecules of the air you are breathing are moving at about 1000 mph. Anything which is moving has kinetic energy. The faster and/or the more massive it is the more kinetic energy it has. The energy an object has because of its vibrating molecules is its heat energy. The hotter and/or more massive it is the more heat energy it has. Electromagnetic radiation with the wavelength of infrared will cause an object's molecules to vibrating faster when it is absorbed by the object. So infrared radiation transfers energy in a way that can be absorbed by an object increasing its heat as it does so. Or: infrared transfers energy, heat is energy. ",

            "answer_text": "Infrared is a range of wavelength of light that is given off by things with a significant temperature, so it can be used to represent heat, such as thermal cameras. Infrared light, like all like, causes heat and can increase the temperature of things when it is absorbed, although the relatively low energy level and low abundance of infrared means it won\u2019t heat things considerably, versus microwaves, which use a lot of microwaves, or nuclear reactors, which have high energy levels. So, infrared is given off from warm things, so it represents heat, and causes heat as much as light does, which isn\u2019t much. Hotter things give off shorter wavelength, higher energy electromagnetic radiation (light), such as the sun, which gives off visible light and ultraviolet light. Some celestial objects eject incredible levels of gamma rays or high-energy radiation, but the bodies of people and animals only give off a little infrared light. ",

            "answer_text": "Infrared is light, or more generally, radiant energy. Heat energy is heat energy. Infrared light is turned from radiant energy into heat when it hits an opaque surface. When warm, opaque surfaces in turn convert heat into infrared light. In a room, these things can happen back and forth thousands of times between the different surfaces of a room. Radiant energy and heat energy are all different forms of energy, and they can turn into eachother over and over again without human intervention. ",

Only a very small band of energies can be sensed by the human eye and this band is called the visible spectrum. the violet end of the spectrum has the most energy while the red end has the least. any energy which is higher than the violet is termed as ULTRAviolet, ultra meaning higher and any energy lower than the red is termed as INFRAred, infra meaning lower! therefore, infra-red is that electromagnetic radiation, whose energy(read:heat) is below that of red light.

            "answer_text": "Infrared radiation is just light, which is formed of photons with a certain frequency. Photons with an infrared frequency transfer energy to objects they come into contact with. The objects then release this extra energy as heat. So I would say that infrared isn't heat, but it causes objects it comes into contact with to release heat. Check out how these infrared heating panels work, it\u2019s really cool and can help you understand it in a real context: https://www.infraredplus.co.uk/why-use-infrared/ ",
