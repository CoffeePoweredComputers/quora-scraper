            "answer_text": "I think the most relevant factor is that people advocating social Darwinism have a skewed idea of the supposed \u201cLaw of the Jungle\", often a wilful misinterpretation based on personal ambition, perceived entitlement & a psychopathic lack of regard for others. The touted interpretation is is that in Nature's scheme of things it is right & proper to sacrifice the weak so the strong can win. In short it is the philosophy of the schoolyard bully on reaching adulthood, & boy is it in evidence around the world today, despite all the lessons of the past. The one lesson we should really take from the past is that that interpretation of Darwin's law is completely wrong. Take any fossil ecosystem & one thing is blindingly obvious: Being top predator is a one way trip to extinction. What the Law of the Jungle really decrees is that however strong you are, everything loses in the end. It is the small generalised & social animals whose dynasties endure. Both civilisation & Christianity are supposed to stand that law on its head. The strong protect the weak, who can do things other than fight, & all benefit. But every 3 generations or so, when grandparents die & take the memories of war- weary youth with them, you can guarantee some idiot somewhere will think it a personal stroke of genius to re-invent ruthlessness. They will diss civilisation as decadence & crash society. Until society loses its temper & sends the dictator the way of the sabre toothed cat. As the world overpopulates & competition for resources intensifies poverty makes a ready audience for disruptive demagogues. Just when we need cooperation to hoard & share resources equitably we are instead urged to exhaust the dwindling supply fighting each other. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of caution is advisable when comparing cultural or economic evolution with biological evolution. For example, there is nothing comparable to the transfer of knowledge from one company or one economic area in biological evolution or comparable to disruptive effects of technological innovation. Another important difference is that organisms eating other organisms do not acquire characteristics of the prey whereas big companies often acquire intellectual property by buying startups and the perspective to sell the startup after some time is an important incentive for founders. What might be learned is that social change is a evolutionary process at all. There is no such thing as a natural order, pre-stabilized harmony, meaning, etc. Social systems are as they are and change as they change as consequence of interactions between actors. But the relevant interactions are pretty different from passing genes to biological offspring. ",
