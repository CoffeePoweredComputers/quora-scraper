            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a general rule in chemistry that \u201clike dissolves like\u201d. This refers to substances\u2019 polarities. If you have a non-polar substance, it can usually only be dissolved by another non-polar substance. Likewise for polar substances. Another general rule is that water dissolves most things. It\u2019s nicknamed a universal solvent for that reason. If you start with those 2 facts in mind, you\u2019ll be able to figure it out for just about any combination. There are things that can speed up the dissolving process like applying heat or stirring the solution, but following the above two rules are a good bet. ",

            "answer_text": "How else but by experiment? There are a few empirical rules, i.e. polar solvents TEND to dissolve polar solutes, and non-polar solvents tend to dissolve non-polar solutes; most solutes TEND to have some solubility in water; but the final arbiter is experiment. Does the solute go up in a given solvent? Here is one for you to consider. Is ethyl alcohol soluble in hexanes; is methyl alcohol soluble in hexanes? What influences the experimental result? ",
