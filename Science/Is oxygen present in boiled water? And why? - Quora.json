Yes, boiled* water does have oxygen in it, but it has lower concentrations as boiled water has a lower capacity for it (the heating energises the air-water solution and the molecules inside get released, the gases of the air more easily, as molecular forces between them are much weaker than those of H2O). *boiled, not boiling, gases start to enter the water but limits entry due to its heat ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to assume you mean dissolved O2 not the oxygen component of the water molecule itself.  Gases do dissolve in water and usually as the temperature increases the dissolved gases respond in inverse proportion to the temperature.  As temp rises dissolved gases are forced out.  But can you get it all out.  No.  As an Engineering Laboratory Technician in the Navy, one of my duties was to monitor and maintain the water chemistry of the steam side of the power plant on submarines.  Water that had been heated to 500 degrees, passed through the turbines as steam and condensed back to water was sampled for O2 daily using the Indigo Carmine test.  The condensate water usually had around 10 ppm O2.  That's not much but it is some. ",
