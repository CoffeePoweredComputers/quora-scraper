            "answer_text": "Antibody are proteins produced by plasma to fight against the virus or bacteria. This is the automatic defence mechanism of the body to fight the disease. We have two type of tests available for testing SARS-COV-2 virus: 1. One is more accurate called RT-PCR which is basically extracting RNA from the nasal or mouth swab. Because of Genome sequencing technology, we have the sequence of SARS-COV-2 and RNA of swab is checked whether virus and RNA share same sequence. Because of good research and Genome sequence projects going around the world, RT-PCR tests are considered more accurate and reliable. But it has its own shortcomings like RNA extracting machines, Specialised Labs, Trained technicians, Logistics, cost of chemicals etc. which add to the cost of tests. Atleast 30 test are required to make it economical. Hence, for sure RT-PCR cannot be used for testing at mass level especially for developing countries like India. 2. Another one not so accurate is Rapid Antibody testing. They are not that accurate because not much research has went into it. Two type of antibody results from infection i.e. IgM and IgG. We still don't have accurate picture about duration of appearance of each. But we have just a rough idea that IgG last longer than IgM. But they are relatively cheaper because of redundancy of many requirements that are needed in RT-PCR. But as per current study, it shows that antibody will take somewhere around 9-28 days to appear in body after infection. This much long interval can make it more dangerous, because infected person can infect other person when he is incorrectly tested negative by antibody test.Hence not so reliable. But the use of antibody test is that it can help policymakers to decide about what is the regional variation of virus. To decide colour coding of zones as done in india. Basically will test the status of virus presence in the country. And plan our response accordingly. ",

It is recommended you wait at least 2\u20133 weeks after a possible exposure or illness to get the antibody testing done. You should ask your doctor what they recommend. Almost any diagnostic laboratory that you might go to for routine bloodwork should be able to do it for you. The testing is a full blood draw, one tube of blood. Call the lab ahead of time to ask whether they do antibody testing and whether you need a script from a doctor or not. Some labs require a script, others do not. Bring your ID and insurance card for registration purposes. ",

The antibodies are distinctive organic compounds that are unique to the bacteria or virus they destroy. If the invading bacteria or virus is new, the immune system requires time to produce the antibodies needed to defeat it, and we will be ill until the invaders are destroyed. When we have recovered from the illness, the immune system continues to produce the antibodies, which make us immune to that disease. The test detects the presence of the antibodies unique to the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we have a vaccine, presence of those antibodies in the blood shows that the person tested has had COVID-19. ",

Donate to the Red Cross The Red Cross is antibody testing all donations currently. Their test, the VITROS Total Anti-SARS-2 test, is robust and well-studied. Pay ~$100 to a local diagnostics laboratory There is likely a diagnostics laboratory near you, such as Quest diagnostics, and many others.

The antibody test is crucial to refining public health policy for all cities, counties, states and the nation. Because once every place I just listed has been statistically, usefully, tested, every location can be very accurately modeled about how serious a next wave of the virus will effect that specific place. It will be known whether when it moves thru a region will there be a manhattan (14 cases per thousand) or california (0.5 cases per thousand) situation. Even before a lockdown can be implemented. .

Technically speaking, it is a Qualitative test (\u201cyes\" or \u201cno\") and not a Quantitative test (\u201chow many\"). But it's a step in the right direction.

In the case of novel corona virus, one would not expect to find any reactive antibody, but it is possible there may be an antibody to another virus that cross-reacts, or a non-specific antibody that reacts weakly. A 4 fold increase in the amount of antibody is evidence of a recent infection. A high titer, established by experiment, is often indicitive of immunity. ",
