            "answer_text": "For simplicity I\u2019ll only describe one use of each element. Hydrogen is often used in power plants as a coolant for large generators that produce a lot of heat. 2. Helium is used in MRI machines to cool the magnetic devices within the machine.  3. Lithium is probably being used to power the phone or laptop you\u2019re reading this answer on.  4. Beryllium is very light, flexible, and conductive, making it an ideal component for the exteriors of projectiles and high-speed aircraft.  5. Boron is often used to strengthen glass.  6. Carbon has countless applications, but one its allotropes, diamond, is used in drill bits to increase drilling ability.  7. Nitrogen is used in fertilizers in the form of nitrates and nitrites.  8. Oxygen we\u2019re breathing it right now\u2026  9. Fluorine is often added to toothpaste in its ionic form, fluoride.  10. Neon is often used to make dazzling signs because of its bright colors and incredible stability.  11. Sodium is a component of sodium chloride, which is table salt.  12. Magnesium is often used to strengthen the metal in vehicles such as cars and planes.  13. Aluminum:  14. Silicon is a crucial component in modern computer chips.  15. Phosphorus is used in matches.  16. Sulfur is used in some fungicides and pesticides.  17. Chlorine is an essential component of bleaches due to its high oxidative capabilities.  18. Argon is very inert, so it can be used to store highly reactive substances. The picture below shows cesium, a highly reactive alkali metal, being stored in argon as to avoid an explosive reaction in which cesium is oxidized.  19. Potassium is essential for human health, so it is often added to our food or taken as a supplement.  20. Because calcium reacts so readily with oxygen, it is often used in steelmaking to remove oxygen from the alloy.  ",
