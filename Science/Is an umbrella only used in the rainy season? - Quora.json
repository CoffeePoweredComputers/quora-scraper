            "answer_text": "Answered: Is an umbrella only used in the rainy season? Thanks for the A2A. The UK does not have a rainy season so no umbrellas are not only used in the rainy season. Because the UK is in the Temperate Climate zone it has 4 seasons Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn, unlike some other countries that have Wet or Dry seasons. It\u2019s possible to have rain during any of the 4 seasons although Winter is often the wettest. How useful an umbrella is here is a matter of debate some people like them but we also often get high winds blowing in straight off the Atlantic Ocean during rainstorms that will destroy them. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course not. I use it in the sunny seasons much more than in the rainy seasons - by far. The umbrella has multiple uses. One of them is for blocking the rain. One other use is for blocking the sun during severe summers. That\u2019s why I take my umbrella whenever the sun shines like fire. And summer is at leat six months long here in a hot, humid subtropical climate. ",
