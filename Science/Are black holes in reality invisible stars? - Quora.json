            "answer_text": "No the black holes are not stars at all. A black hole is formed when Red Supergiant dies. This type of star explodes with a huge amount of energy called supernova and that explosion can end life on any planet which comes in its way. After the explosion, black hole is formed. If you would like to know the full process:- Stars are formed in clouds of dust and gas called nebulae(singular-nebula) The gas and dust in the nebula shrinks to a point because of gravity. In the middle of the core, it gets very hot. When this happens, nuclear fusion starts and a star is born. After the big bang, the same thing happened but 300-500 million years after the big bang. Now I will talk about that how black holes are formed. They are one of the most mysterious objects in the universe. So how are they formed?? Read till the end. Black holes are formed after the death of a supergiant star. In stars, nuclear fusion reaction takes place in which in the inner core of the stars, millions of tonnes of hydrogen is converted into helium per second. This is how a star lives. So now I will discuss the whole process of lifecycle of a star so the readers will understand better. As I told earlier that stars are formed in clouds of dust and gas. In a nebula these kinds of stars form:- Massive star, Average star and Red dwarf star. Red dwarf stars are not very different from average stars. The main difference is that a red dwarf star has less mass. It's temperature is not much high. They can survive for a much longer time than an average star. According to astronomers, red dwarfs can burn upto 10 trillion years as they consume they consume there hydrogen fuel very slowly whereas average age of an average star is upto 10 billion years for example our sun. In massive stars, hydrogen fuel is finished after some millions of years as they consume there fuel very fast as compared to average stars. Now lets take a look at there lifecycle:-  1) Average star So lets take a look at the lifecycle of an average star. As I told earlier stars are formed in nebula. So in a nebula when an average star is born, it is very dim in the beginning. After 5 billion years, it has completed its half life. Like for example, our Sun which was born 4.6 billion years ago has completed its half life. Our sun will burn for the next 5 billion years. At the end of the life of an average star, it becomes a red giant star. After 5 billion years from now, our Sun will also become a red giant and it will become much bigger that mercury and venus will be wiped out of existence. Might be Earth also. But till that time, just imagine that how advanced will the human civilisation become? Don't worry We will find a new planet. So coming back to the topic, at the end the star will finish its hydrogen fuel completely and will collapse and its outer layer will be vanished in space and this will form a Planetary nebula. And at the end it will become a white dwarf star. Average stars have a peaceful death but not massive stars. The black doesn't form in the death of an average star. 2) Massive star As the name suggests, these stars are large in size from birth. These stars consume there hydrogen fuel very fast and live for only a few 100 thousand years or millions of years. Massive stars experience a violent end. At the time of their death, they explode. This explosion is called supernova. All the mass and material of the dust is exploded in space. NOW WHAT REMAINS??? If the star is a red supergiant, it will become a Neutron star. The black holes forms when a star is a red hypergiant. Some of the examples of red supergiant stars:- Antares, Betelgeuse Some examples of red hypergiant stars:- VY_Canis_Majoris and the largest star ever discovered:-UY Scuti THANK YOU -Written by Pranay Arora ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. They're not holes at all. That name was meant as a joke. They are old stars that have collapsed so tightly, with such a huge gravitational pull, that not even light can get out. They're no longer hot, compressing hydrogen into helium and releasing energy. It's not possible to say what one looks like because no light can illuminate them. ",
