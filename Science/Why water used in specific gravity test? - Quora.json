            "answer_text": "It\u2019s totally arbitrary, but if your to-do list for today includes \u201ccreate a system of measurements that will last hundreds of years the world over\u201d, why not use the easiest, most reproducible thing in the world as a standard? Water filled that bill - at least at the time [approximately 1792, in France - see History of the metric system - Wikipedia]. Incidentally, the team consisted of some serious, SERIOUS heavyweights - Jean-Charles de Borda, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Gaspard Monge and Nicolas de Condorcet - the contemporary equivalent of getting Shaq and LeBron in the same room together. It\u2019s not that DENSITY was DEFINED as 1.000000, but the unit of measurement, the meter [as well as its subunits and superunits] was defined as 1/10 millionth of the distance from the poles to the equator, and a kilogram was then defined as the mass of cubic decimeter of water . The the notion of unitary density thus implicitly fell out of those two definitions. The history of these items has evolved since then, of course, as we get better at adding precision [basically, decimal points] to measurements we make. But even today, for every practical purpose, water is good ol\u2019 1.0. ",
