            "answer_text": "Learning how to make scientific experiments more accurate is one of the reasons for studying science. One way to read the history of science is the growth in experimental methods - methods that enable us to measure new things, methods that enable us to increase our certainty, methods that get applied in new ways. There are so many methods known that the best way probably depends on the experiment. For example, in medicine, double blind drug tests are well known and there\u2019s a whole literature on the details. A couple of answers have already mentioned the well known method of collecting more data and averaging the results. This uses the \u201claw of large numbers\u201d to reduce the uncertainty in the average. A detailed knowledge of statistics can help you plan your experiments, e.g., by estimating how much data you need to establish a target level of confidence. Another quite general method is iteration. Do a first experiment; analyze the results; use what you learn to design a better experiment. Sources of uncertainty identified in the first experiment can be used to choose new methods that reduce those uncertainties. Uncertainties from the first experiment can be used to decide how many repeats are needed in the second experiment. Repeating the experiment may lead to different results because some unknown factor is different in the two cases - leading to more experiments to identify that factor. At a larger scale, the scientific community iterates interesting experiments, not only repeating but modifying earlier experiments. Just for fun I\u2019ll add two very specific suggestions. They may not always be appropriate. Please don\u2019t follow them blindly. But it\u2019s often useful to Use a laser to make your measurements.Use a computer to automatically collect and store your data.Good luck. ",

            "answer_text": "The average of any set of measurements is more precise, but not more accurate, the more measurements you take. Roughly speaking, you improve your precision but not your accuracy by a factor of 44% for every time you double your sample size. If all you want to do is make your \u2018picture\u2019 less fuzzy, then train your \u2018telescope\u2019 on the sample for longer. But if you are worried your \u2018telescope\u2019 is telling you lies, or isn\u2019t telling you the whole story, you need to improve the design of your experiment instead. There is a whole field for this - called Design of Experiment (DoE) - it can get rather mathematically involved. Design of experiments - Wikipedia Think of a graph, with both the x and y (and so on\u2026) axes being potential values your experimental variables can take. Every point on that graph is a potential measurement. You might naively want to hold everything but one axis still, and do your experiment on there - but in the vast vast majority of cases that\u2019s a waste. What you do instead, is you provide different combinations of stimuli designed to map out as large a volume (area, if there are only two axes) on that graph as possible with as few points as possible. It\u2019s like those logic puzzles where you\u2019ve got a box with a dozen switches on the outside and you\u2019re trying to work out what combination of switches turns on the light inside the box. Then when you\u2019re confident you know which factors actually affect the outcome you\u2019re trying to optimise, you measure just those - again, changing two or three or more factors at once is more efficient than just changing one at a time - but this time you are also looking for intermediate values, which will tell you whether the outcome changes nonlinearly with one or more factors - whether there is a peak or a trough or a saddle point or something inside the area you\u2019re investigating. Choosing which sets of factors are most efficient is a job for a computer - as, frankly, is the first bunch of data analysis. ",
