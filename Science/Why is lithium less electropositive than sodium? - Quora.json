            "answer_text": "Because sodium has one more quantum shell than lithium. The extra shell sodium has increases the shielding effect towards outer shell electrons. It also increases the distance between the positive nucleus and the outer shell. So nuclear attraction decreases. As a result of this, sodium's ability to pull onto electrons is lower than that of lithium's. Thus sodium is more electropositive than lithium. The general trend is that electronegativity decreases going down groups. \u2014Gt. Yuhan Zhang (Proud A-level Chemistry student) ",
