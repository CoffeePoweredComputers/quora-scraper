            "answer_text": " Chemists Joel Rosenthal and Daniel G. Nocera of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology provide this answer. When molecular hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) are combined and allowed to react together, energy is released and the molecules of hydrogen and oxygen can combine to form either water or hydrogen peroxide. These two processes are represented by the two chemical equations shown at right. Chemists use redox half-reactions to describe thermodynamic processes like the ones embodied by such equations. For both of the reactions shown, the hydrogen molecules are oxidized and the oxygen atoms are reduced. Accordingly, each of the reactions below is described by a combination of two half-reactions--one corresponding to a chemical oxidation and another corresponding to a reduction. The redox half-reaction for hydrogen oxidation is relatively simple and is shown on the left side of the scheme below. In this oxidation, a molecule of hydrogen gas is ionized to two electrons and two protons. Writing a half-reaction for oxygen reduction is more complicated, since oxygen can be reduced by either one, two or four electrons, as shown by the square redox scheme to the right, below. In most chemical reactions, molecular oxygen is reduced along the red and blue pathways highlighted in this redox scheme. The complete reduction of O2 by four electrons (4e- + 4H+, blue horizontal pathway) generates two equivalents of water whereas the corresponding two-electron reduction (2e + 2H+, red diagonal pathway) yields hydrogen peroxide. Both the two- (G = -0.695 V) and four-electron (G = -1.229 V) reductions of O2 are energetically downhill, but more than half a volt of energy is squandered in the former reaction. Accordingly, biological processes coupled to O2 reduction, such as cellular respiration, are highly selective for the complete 4e- + 4H+ pathway in order to maximize the energy available for ATP synthesis. The selective reduction of oxygen to water in such biological systems is crucial, not only in order to maximize the energy produced for cellular metabolism but also because hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidant and cytotoxin, which harms living cells. Given the energetics presented above, there is a strong thermochemical bias for the production of water over hydrogen peroxide when H2 and O2are reacted together. For instance, when hydrogen gas is burned in the presence of oxygen, a large amount of energy is released and water is produced as the major product. In cases where the reaction is more controlled, however, such as the consumption of hydrogen and oxygen in a fuel cell, the mechanism and kinetics of the O2 reduction process can complicate issues greatly. For instance, the delivery of the protons and electrons derived from the ionization of hydrogen (see redox half-reaction above) to a molecule of oxygen has to be precisely controlled via a process know as proton-coupled electron transfer in order to ensure that the complete four-electron reduction of O2 dominates. Platinum metal is capable of serving as a catalyst that brandishes exquisite selectivity for the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water, and accordingly lies at the heart of fuel cell design and function. Given that platinum is rare and extremely expensive, current research is aimed at the development of structural and functional models for oxygen activation and reduction to water via proton-coupled electron transfer. Similar strategies are also being exploited to drive the energetically uphill reverse reaction, in which hydrogen is produced from water using solar energy. The success of both these areas of work may ultimately prove crucial to the development and sustainability of a global hydrogen economy. ",

            "answer_text": "We certainly can create water easily from hydrogen and oxygen. However, you aren't going to get a Nobel Prize for solving the world clean water shortages. The problem is hydrogen. Oxygen is no problem. We are literally bathed in oxygen. It makes up a significant part of the air around us. Without it, we would all die. Hydrogen is also common. It is a major part of all the water, oil, fat, protein, carbohydrate, and cellulose that make all the people, plants and animals and many other things around us. However, hydrogen is not usually free. It is usually stuck onto elements to form a compound. Pulling the hydrogen out of that compound, so that you can use it to make your water, is hard work. It takes energy. Then you have to store that hydrogen. You don't need to store the oxygen. You can just grab that from the air as and when it is required. But you have to store the hydrogen till you are going to use it. Hydrogen is voluminous. You need a lot of hydrogen to make even just a little water. To help storage, you could cool the hydrogen and pressurise it but that is yet more hard work. It's much easier to make clean water from dirty water than to make water by generating hydrogen and burning that gas to make water. The short answer is that nature has already used all the available hydrogen to make water and greedily didn't leave any for you to play with. ",

            "answer_text": "Why can we not simply create water if it\u2019s the simple combination of hydrogen and oxygen? A quick scan through the answers shows that you CAN produce water from reacting hydrogen and oxygen directly - just burn it. Everyone thinks of uncontrolled explosions, but it can be controlled and that is the basis of the hydrogen torch used for cutting through metals / welding. Oxyhydrogen - Wikipedia No-one I noticed has stated that this is the basis of the hydrogen / oxygen fuel cell (though perhaps alluded to n the reference to the movie \u201cThe Martian\u201d). This fuel cell is used to produce electricity on space stations and the only by-product is pure drinking water that is used for drinking and rehydrating food. In this way, mass and space are minimised at a time when both are at a premium.  The combination of hydrogen and oxygen is the classic case of the conflict between thermodynamic and kinetic control\u2026 Thermodynamically the reaction is extremely exothermic, yet it doesn\u2019t occur at all under standard conditions. The reason is, as others have stated, that the molecules must first be dissociated into atoms and the energy required for this intermediate step is too high for ordinary room temperature and pressure. That\u2019s where the spark comes in to push the first few molecules over the activation energy barrier, releasing sufficient energy to cause a rapid chain reaction. Alternatively, and less explosively, it is possible to reduce the energy barrier by using a catalyst (platinum is good here) which allows the molecules to dissociate at room temperature and pressure by providing a surface onto which they can adsorb to form an intermediate between the catalyst and the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen - this requires far less energy than just pulling the molecules apart.

The planet Earth is not massive enough to hang onto elemental hydrogen gas, and thus lost most of whatever it formed with very early on. Nearly all of Earth\u2019s current remaining supply of hydrogen that has not escaped is bound in compounds to other, heavier atoms. And by far the most common source of\u2026. wait for it\u2026. \u2026.water. And nearly every other available source (like hydrocarbons) originally got their hydrogens from reactions with water in the distant past. So in order to get the hydrogen you need to \u201csimply\u201d combine with oxygen to make water, you must first get the hydrogen from somewhere, and the only viable large scale source is from water itself, either directly or several steps removed. So to \u201ccreate\u201d more water you first must \u201cdestroy\u201d pre-existing water. Which, from a practical point of view, isn\u2019t very useful. (And the oxygen? Yeah, most of that came originally from water too\u2026.) ",

In fact the simple combustion reaction of O2(g)+2H2(g)\u21922H2O(g)O2(g)+2H2(g)\u21922H2O(g) will give you the desired result, once you\u2019ve condensed out the water. However: Be forewarned. Combining 1 mole of Oxygen with 2 moles of H2, corresponds to about 70L of gas at STP. This will make 2 moles of water (or about 32ml) + release a lot of heat. So for a 300 ml glass, you\u2019ll need ~227L of O2 gas and 454L of H2 gas (at STP)\u2026and a you\u2019ll probably wake up your neighbors if you do this all at once. Alternatively, you can be smart about it and make a hydrogen fuel cell and catalyze the reaction on a Pt surface. Note that catalyzing a reaction can work both ways. You can accelerate slow reactions or slow down fast reactions. In this case you want to slow down the reaction by first dissociating O2 and H2 on a Pt surface (following a Langmuir-Hinschelwood mechanism). O2(g)\u21cc2O(s)O2(g)\u21cc2O(s) H2(g)\u21cc2H(s)H2(g)\u21cc2H(s) Then, have O(s)+H(s)\u21ccHO(s)O(s)+H(s)\u21ccHO(s) and finally HO(s)+H(s)\u2192H2O(g)\u2192H2O(liq)HO(s)+H(s)\u2192H2O(g)\u2192H2O(liq) where X(s), X(g), and X(liq) denote whether the species is adsorbed on the surface (s), in the gas phase (g), or in liquid phase (liq). One can then use the excess heat (carried off by the H2O(g)H2O(g) and condensed to liquid) as an energy source for like a steam turbine. But, that\u2019s now an engineering problem. I\u2019ll leave it as an exercise for the reader (and my p-chem class this spring!) to work out the rate law. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Yes, You can make water by simply adding hydrogen and oxygen. By the way, this is the simplest and straight way to make water but the first thing is that you have to supply some energy to the reaction (in form of heat) to start the reaction (activation energy). Please note that it is a redox reaction. In the process the oxygen is reduced and hydrogen is oxidised. Or you can in simple words call it as burning of hydrogen so in order to start the reaction you will have to mix hydrogen and oxygen in the ratio 2:1 (by volume) and ignite it the rest process is an exothermic process. And the water is formed. This is the reaction which will take place:  Please note that the burning of hydrogen is very different from burning of commercial fuel. Hydrogen burns rapidly producing instantaneous heat which can be dangerous for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Strange question, it is indeed a very simple reaction hydrogen and Oxygen combining to get water but what is the purpose of this? There is indeed 20% or so in the atmosphere but you will have to get hydrogen from somewhere and for sure you will lose energetically. Either you get hydrogen from water or from hydrocarbons or else. The only way to make it and still be ahead is using an enzymatic reaction powered by the sun to get your Hydrogen from renewables This hydrogen can then be used in a fuel cell to move a car or give your house energy. It is then indirect energy from the sun but still it would result in water. If we can make better fuel cells using Methanol, we could use methanol instead and eliminate the Hydrogen compression step. I believe this is the way to follow, develop a methanol economy rather than hydrogen. Enzymatic Hydrogen Production:\u2009 Conversion of Renewable Resources for Energy Production ",

When this occurs an electrical charge is created which is used in cats to power an electric Motor Arquably this is the most practical and environmentally friendly alternative to petrol and desil engines. Do not be taken in by the hype electric cars are a dog. There batteries require rare earth metals (the anctinides and lanctinides), which are the bottom 2 lines on the periodic table. They are called rare earth's because they are rare so to get sufficient quantities requires the processing of huge amounts of source material using quess what? Desil powered earth moving plant go figure. Many rare earth's are also radioactive making battery disposal problematic. Also in. New Zealand as in other countries, thier idn't enough juice in the system to charge the fleet even if only Half the fleet was electric. Like many things it's all hype car manufacturers like all companies want to make money, therfore they will cater to a popularist market. Note however that companies like Toyota are investing mega billions in hydrogen fuel cell technology at the expense of evs. Go figure ",

            "answer_text": "You can. Mix hydrogen and oxygen, add a spark, and presto! You get water. The reaction is vigorously exothermic and the reaction kinetics are quite high, so step back before you do it. The water will be very hot, so you\u2019ll get water vapor, not liquid water. But you totally can do this. You can even take water apart and put it back together, if you like. Get a glass of water, add a pinch of salt, put two bits of bare copper wire in the glass, connect a battery, and you\u2019ll see bubbles form on the wire. Those bubbles are hydrogen and oxygen. Collect them, combine them, strike a match, and you\u2019ll get your water back. ",

As we know from the formula of water, there are two hydrogen atoms for every one oxygen atom, so already we see that just combining one mole of H2 and one mole of O2 is not going to work out. The balanced chemical reaction for the formation of water is as follows: 2H2 (g) + O2 (g) \u2192 2H2O (g) Notice that both hydrogen and oxygen are in their gaseous state, and that you are combining two moles of H2 for every one mole of O2. This reaction also falls under the categorization of a combustion reaction, which is highly exothermic given the bond enthalpies involved. Thus, you cannot just combine molecules of hydrogen and oxygen; you have to combine the two constituent elements and then invest a ton of energy for water to be formed. Hope this helps! ",

It would take some effort with vapor pressure, relative humidity, and the methods of collecting the water from where it is designed to condense. It's kind of like the backwards efforts of water forming on the exterior of a cold beverage. That's the same sort of water creation you'd get with a designed system for your purposes. ",

Once activation energy is achieved, molecules are colliding with enough energy so that bonds are broken and new ones are formed. In a chemical reaction, not only must the molecules collide with enough energy, but they must collide into the right other molecule at the right orientation with their electrons at the proper places in order for a reaction to occur.

The chemistry is an oxidation known as combustion in which two gases combine to give another gas (H22O) at a higher temperature (because it is a highly exothermic reaction). If you want liquid water to drink, you also have to do some engineering (applied physics) to cool down the hot gas to a temperature at which it condenses. If you wish to drink it, I suggest down to 40 degrees C. Thus you would need some source of cooling. In the film \u201cThe Martian\u201d the hero first makes hydrogen from rocket fuel and then water from the hydrogen; but he discovers that the energies involved make the processes quite dangerous. ",

Plenty of oxygen there, but you\u2019d have to find a way to bring in the hydrogen. At that point you might as well just fly in actual water from the nearest oasis. There is hydrogen in the atmosphere, but not enough to create water, and not for very long after it is created: If hydrogen is released into the atmosphere, what becomes of it? Does it react with oxygen to form water? Does it drift off into space? ",

And it's lucky, because otherwise it would be bursting into flames at the slightest provocation. ",

The formula is 2(h2) + o2 = 2(h2o) 2 moles of hydrogen gas plus one mole of oxygen gas yields 2 moles of water. However simply mixing the gasses together will not yield water. Energy is needed to start the reaction. In this case an electric spark or a flame. One started The hydrogen and oxygen will combine to make water. So what is happening here is simple combustion. Hydrogen is the fuel and oxygen is the oxidizer. The hydrogen burns and produces hydrogen oxide otherwise known as water. ",

Hydrogen is a very inert gas and hence to make a covalent bond with oxygen, it needs to share its only electron hence a lot of energy needs to be given as input. Practically it can be achieved by a fuel cell in which a spark is initiated such that hydrogen can burn and result in water vapour. But please dont try at home ",

There is ice on Mars, but if you did land on a place without it, and you had hydrazine, the idea of making hydrogen is just silly. Burn the hydrazine. Burning anything with hydrogen will make water - it does not have to be pure hydrogen, although you will make something else. In the case of hydrazine, you would also make nitrogen ",

Once the process has started, there is enough energy to keep it going. ",

Hydrogen gas is much lighter than air, and with it\u2019s tiny molecules (tiny, even compared to other molecules!), it\u2019s molecules can escape much more easily than other gasses. tl;dr: maybe your hyrdogen leaked out ",
