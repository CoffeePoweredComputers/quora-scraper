            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t see how the equation shows that a photon must have mass. It simply shows that mass and energy are equal, and the amount of energy contained in matter can be calculated using the equation E=mc\u00b2. (Energy is equal to mass-multiplied-by-speed-of-light-squared). We need to remember, unless otherwise specified, 'mass' always means 'rest mass' - the mass of an object in a frame of reference in which it is not moving, and is the same for all observers. The photon does not have a rest mass as it is never 'at rest'. However, photons have energy. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the photon's frequency. (To find the energy of a photon, we need to multiply Planck's constant by the speed of light, then divide by the photon's wavelength). You may argue that a photon has energy so it has mass. In the special theory of relativity, the mass that is assigned to a body in motion is known as relativistic mass - which increases as the velocity of the body approaches the speed of light. In other words, relativistic mass is the measure of the energy of a particle, which changes with velocity. The relativistic mass is always equal to the total energy (rest energy plus kinetic energy) divided by speed of light squared. This leads to the confusion that relativistic mass equivalent to energy, whereas in actual fact, mass is only the part of the energy of a body which is not kinetic energy. This is why the term \u2018relativistic mass\u2019 is not used nowadays \u2013 to avoid confusion. Therefore, photons have energy and momentum but no mass. ",

            "answer_text": "Photon has a zero rest mass m_0 and relativistic mass m =E/c^2. Many physicist do not use relativistic mass terminology but that is their mistake Basically they are trying to save general relativity theory from conflicts such as the one presented in your question. Lorentz transformation equations which are derived from purely geometrical considerations leads to following relation.  Naturally when you put m_0 = 0 and v = c, the relativistic mass becomes indeterminate. This shows that there is some problem with the Lorentz Transformation equations, because this does not happen when you use the energy momentum invariant given by, E^2 = E_0^2 + (cp)^2 The result you get is E = mc^2. Now, there is another way of deriving the Lorentz transformation factor . We can simply divide the energy momentum invariant by m_0c^2 and we get it. With this derived expression, we will have the same problem of infinity. Mathematics permits this operation of division but the physics does not permit it. Dirac Heisenberg formalism, Yang Mills theory, general relativity, M theory are founded upon Lorentz transformation, and everyone knows how frequently they run into infinities and renormalisation problems. This problem gets worst with the spin 2 symmetric metric tensor which predicts graviton, because it is not renormalizable. So the conclusion is that the energy momentum invariant is a more fundamental and physical expression than the Lorentz transformation equations. And what mathematics permits need not always be consistent with the physical reality. Therefore energy based theories are superior to the geometrical theories and under no circumsatnces should one violate the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum. ",

            "answer_text": "It also turns out that in special relativity, we are able to define the concept of \"energy\" E , such that E has simple and well-defined properties just like those it has in newtonian mechanics. When a particle has been accelerated so that it has some momentum p (the length of the vector p ) and relativistic mass mrel , then its energy E turns out to be given by E = mrel c 22 , and also E22= p22 c 22 + m22rest c 44. (1) There are two interesting cases of this last equation: 1. If the particle is at rest, then p = 0 , and E = mrest c22. 2. If we set the rest mass equal to zero (regardless of whether or not that's a reasonable thing to do), then E = pc . In classical electromagnetic theory, light turns out to have energy E and momentum p , and these happen to be related by E = pc . Quantum mechanics introduces the idea that light can be viewed as a collection of \"particles\": photons. Even though these photons cannot be brought to rest, and so the idea of rest mass doesn't really apply to them, we can certainly bring these \"particles\" of light into the fold of equation (1) by just considering them to have no rest mass. That way, equation (1) gives the correct expression for light, E = pc , and no harm has been done. Equation (1) is now able to be applied to particles of matter and \"particles\" of light. It can now be used as a fully general equation, and that makes it very useful. ",

            "answer_text": "No. E=mc^2 doesn't imply that photon must have mass. The relation describes only the mass-energy equivalence. That matter can exist in both the forms. In a chemical process if new substance(s) is(are) forming ,thenmay be sum total of mass of reactants is not equal to the sun total of mass of products and the matter is in the form of energy. So the conservation is hold always \u2014 may be conservation of mass may be of energy and may be mass-energy. Photon has zero rest mass . And it can be proved by following equation:  Take the denominator to LHS multiply by m. Put v=c(for photon).you will get m0 zero. ",

            "answer_text": "In spite of what the other answers write, E is not equal to mc^2. That is a relation that is valid only in the rest frame of a particle. The correct relation is E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4. The quantity (E^2 - p^2 c^2) is the magnitude of the momentum energy four vector. For a photon, there is no rest frame (in all frames of reference, light moves at a velocity v = c). m = 0 for light and E = pc. For some reason, the only relation that readers seem to be familiar with from STR is the E = mc^2 relation! Few seem to have heard of the full relativistic form! ",

Every object has some mass, meaning that it has energy in a condensed form which normally people take it as mass-energy equivalence. Mass is nothing as such if we consider physics as a whole. A photon is moving at the speed of light so it cannot be expressed in any unit because it does not affect the Higgs Field not even a single bit and does not have any mass to it. ",
