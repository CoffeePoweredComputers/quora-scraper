            "answer_text": "Direct measurements are done for objects out to a few thousand parcecs (a parsec is about 3.25 light years for simplicity sake). This is done using trigonometry. The observational angle of an object is taken at one time then taken again 6 months later (paralax) we know how far the earth traveled in that time so we have one side of a triangle and two angles so we can calculate the distance. When an object becomes so far away that those angles are super tiny, that method is untenable. Inside our galaxy we can use the types and brightness of stars to figure how far they are. We compare the brightness of the same type of star to one that we already measured and that tells us how far it is. Once you start talking about other galaxies however, we can not make out individual stars so we have to rely on a certian type of supernova that supposedly is always the same brightness. At this point, we use what is called the cosmic distance ladder which is a variaty of techniques that are compared to guess a distance. Here it is:  At the top of the chart, is the Hubble constant. Since the universe is expanding, light waves are stretched out. The longer they travel, the more they are stretched. A stretched wave has its peaks come to you less frequently or\u2026 at a lower frequency. This is call called red shift. Red because it is the lowest frequency of light we can see with our eyes but in reality, the shift can go far beyond red and deep into the infrared and beyond. The \u201cconstant\u201d in the Hubble constant means that for a certian distance we know that light will stretch a specific amount. So if we look at a galaxy and see how much its spectrum deviates from what it should be, we can then calculate its distance from its using the Hubble constant. I do have to say that the Hubble constant is revised frequently and not compleatly known because sometimes the methods used to calculate it do not always agree. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically in the space we define three coordinates. But sometimes a fourth co-ordinate is also considered which is called time co-ordinate. for example let us say that Sun dies at a moment. Then that moment is experienced by people living on earth after 8 minutes which is the time taken by the sun's light to reach Earth. but these calculations are taken into consideration on a very high level astronomy . So don't panic and use the three co-ordinate system to specify the relative position. Actually brother position is only relative that means that we can define anything with respect to any other thing so in the space we use an object such as International Space Station as a moving frame etcetera to specify the coordinates.
