            "answer_text": "Yes. It does. For all the people saying that magic only works if you believe in it, that makes me laugh \u2026 As a magician I know that one of the most important parts of magic ESP black magic , is to never tell anyone about it. Once it's done, the magician needs to completely forget about it. Never to mention it and never to think about it. So if someone calls you and says \u201cI cursed you!\u201d Most times that person is not a part of traditional magical path or sect or group or thinking. Magic is not to be mentioned. Sure there are people who exist who are born magical and I think that they can do magic easily , and when they wish someone harm it can happen. There is a lot of power with certain people and their intentions. But a real magician would never tell you he cursed you. Sorry. That would be a sure fire way for it not to work. Most people who do magic believe that there is a price to be paid though with any kind of black magic. This is the idea of sacrifice \u2026 You have to sacrifice something and the bigger the sacrifice the stronger it is. Shaman for example, when they do their death to the material world - because shaman have to die.. They are known as walkers of both worlds , and they are like half alive and half dead, so they can access the other side at will. They have to sacrifice something that they love, a part of them\u2026 Something they don't want to live without. All witches and witch crafts I'm almost positive believe that whatever they put out into the universe , it will come back to them times 3. This is known as various things like the witches code or the three by three law. So they don't do a lot of black magic because they know it will come back to them. Most ceremonial magicians also believe that there is some sort of price involved. Like if they do black magic , they sort of expect to have a tumultuous period in their life - that's almost how you know it worked. Say you do some black magic and life is going along and then you get pulled over and your car gets inpounded. Well, they would know that there magic is working, at that point. Chaos magicians on the other hand, don't believe there is any consequences to black magic. They are the only ones who don't believe in the price. Chaos magicians are notorious in the magic community , and people tend to be slightly frightened of them because of this. But chaos magic is defined by rebellion. In a way. They don't have any set rules or belief systems / a chaos magician could go to church on Sunday. They use whatever magic they want , in any way they want. They are the unruly. But the ideology behind chaos is to let go , to unlearn everything you've learned In life. It's to become anything at any time . How do you do that? You have to let go of everything you are and hold on to. I think there are some paths like voodoo and other South American / African magics that don't define themselves as black / white but basically mix it all together. But they also use sacrifice , part of that is to prevent the magician or practitioner from suffering the consequences. The reason why people believe that there is some sort of price to be paid is because of the basic tenant of duality, balance. Which is one of the foundations of magic. For everything , there is an opposite or a balance or its duality. Have you ever heard of the saying As it is done above , so below? That saying means many things, but it also is about magic.. What is done in the aether , must be reflected in the material universe. Or what is done in the astral plane must also be done in the material plane. It's like there are dual universes. One is spiritual and one is flesh. If you can manipulate the aether, then you can manipulate the material world. For every action there is a reaction. Basic physics. Right? The duality is a important part of the universe. This is also why magicians don't think exactly like other people. What to you is evil, to them is the absence of good, but good is also just defined by what you've been taught, and mostly what you've been force fed to believe . Everything has its place and purpose. To each of these things is assigned and in that way, all of it is equal and all of it is meant exactly as it is. All of it has a positive intention. This is why most ceremonial magicians don't think of black magic like you do. They don't think of it as something scary and bad or evil. Everything has a purpose and everything has a place. We too, are dual. The greatest men are men of great duality. Nothing is all good or all bad. We don't really know what is good or what is bad. We have all just been taught that. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many misconceptions going around about magic, especially due to literature and cinema (especially in the fantasy and gothic genre). For example, black magic is not opposed to abrahamic religions or to the abrahamic God. It is not a collection of superficial formulas (spells, rituals etc) that anybody can use effectively simply by going through the words and the motions. It is not a power that can be stolen or obtained by cheating, bribing or adulation, and it does not reside in special objects that anybody can use in the same way.

Parama Devi's answer to How is it possible to change a person's destiny with black magic? I will now elaborate more about this specific question on black magic. The easiest form, that is accessible to anyone, consists in making some kind of agreement with ghosts. Basically you call/ attract a ghost and offer service or friendship, and then you ask for favors in return. A ghost is an individual who is still too attached to its past life environment for a variety of reasons and therefore is not able to proceed to the next progressive destination for a constructive rebirth. So it remains in a subtle mental body composed of memories, thoughts, emotions, desires etc, and because it does not have a gross material body with senses and organs of actions, it is unable to fulfill its gross desires in a tangible manner. Ghosts can, however, use their mental senses and powers more freely than embodied people who are strongly identified with a gross material body; if a ghost learns to control the sense of time, space, direction, and memory, it is free to travel and see many things, absorb energy from external sources and experience pleasure through the inner mental senses (something also embodied persons can do, with the proper training and effort). If a ghost learns to use the interconnectivity of the bio-magnetic fields (including the minds of embodied beings), it can easily apply telepathy and telekinesis, influence or control the minds of weaker human beings and many animals, and even enter the body of another embodied person - a phenomenon we call \"possession\". If the ghost is powerful enough and knows how to manipulate the minds of others to build on their energy, it can even materialise some ectoplasmatic substance or images (\"apparitions\" or \"astral projections\") or other manifestations that can be perceived by the gross material senses of embodied people. Again, all these are powers that any human being potentially has and can develop with the proper training, but because of gross material identification embodied beings have more difficulties in recognising and accessing such faculties. There are many ghosts who are quite powerful and can provide useful help to their servants or friends. However, there is always a price to pay for their help, and the worshiper who is naive, foolish or ignorant will certainly have some very nasty surprises at some point in time. If the \"magician\" is content to use a weak ghost (as that of a child for example), there is less danger, but still any negative intention or emotion from the part of the \"magician\" will easily attract more dangerous spirits who were not specifically called but hang around this type of practictioners. This is also the reason why s\u00e9ances and \"ghost safaris\" are not a good idea. Even watching ghost or horror movies could attract problems. Ghosts are usually malevolent spirits, because their inability to get a new body and a new life creates anger, frustration, envy, and sometimes cruelty and hatred in their minds. Their preferred offering is the warm blood of weak creatures who are experiencing pain and fear, because a ghost easily feeds on bio-magnetic energy. It is also important to remember that any action performed as an offering to ghosts still brings bad karma to the worshiper, so each favor from a ghost will have to be paid several times over. All the stories about vampires, devils, orcs, goblins etc originated from some sort of contact with malevolent ghosts, and although the vast majority of that folklore is mere fantasy and superstition, there is something real at the bottom of it all. The second level of magic taps directly into elemental forces without the help of individual ghosts, and can be compared to the modern concept of sub-atomic physics. After all, the definition of \"magic\" has been normally applied by ignorant people to anything they could not understand or explain with their limited knowledge. For most people, science is magic, especially regarding the most advanced knowledge of the laws of the universe and the subtlest technologies. At this level there is no \"black\" or \"white\" magic, but simply POWER (energy): the black or white definition only applies to the intentions and applications chosen by the individual \"magician\". And just as in sub-atomic physics, energy and matter are simply two aspects of the same reality and can be changed one into the other. Those who engage in \"magic\" on this level should be aware that they are working with forces that are immensely more dangerous than high-voltage electricity or atomic bombs, and must be handled very expertly and purely. If the intentions are not pure, and if harm is done to innocent or good creatures, the action will backfire horribly. It is said it will come back \"3 times 3\" but that is a figure of speech, because the effects are often so devastating that they will seriously damage the individual (the \"magician\") lifetime after lifetime, and they can be almost impossible to repair. It is an extremely painful way to learn the lessons of life. Of course, there is also a great number of fraudsters, illusionists, tricksters, and deluded people who have convinced themselves (and sometimes others) that they have some \"special powers\". Mostly they belong to the category of entertainers, therefore they may be more visible to the public. If they obtain any result through their gimmicks, it is usually due to the very low-strength form of actual mind control and elemental manipulation that is generally called \"placebo effect\". How to defend oneself from black magic attacks? Any ghost attack can be fought back in a relatively easy manner, simply by using your own will power and mental strength to oppose the will power and mental strength of your aggressor. You can take a defensive stance or attack back, depending on your strength and skills, and on the particular circumstances. You can certainly invoke higher powers such as your ista devata, your spirit guide, your guru, friendly siddhas, etc. You can rely on any symbols or instruments (psychic armors, etc) that strengthen your determination and energy and weaken the determination and energy of your opponent. There are several protective measures that have been popular since very ancient times (circles, lines and diagrams, salt, water, fire etc) but in the end it is all in your mind. Do not be afraid. Danger is real, fear is not real. If you cling to fear, you become weaker and therefore more vulnerable. ",
