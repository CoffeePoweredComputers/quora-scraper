            "answer_text": "To answer this you have to understand what pH means. It\u2019s a mathematical formula, pH=\u2212log(H+)pH=\u2212log(H+). As a result of this, this means we can calculate the necessary concentration of H+H+ to equal 0. When the equation is solved, we find that the concentration of H+H+ must be 1 M. As some strong acids can be dissolved in water at a concentration greater than 1 M (including hydrochloric acid), a solution can have a pH of 0. Note that I said concentration, pH is a measure of concentration, it\u2019s not an intrinsic property of a substance. pH only ever makes sense if we\u2019re talking about a solution of some substance dissolved in water*. So, for this example, hydrochloric acid does not have a pH of 0, I can make a solution of hydrochloric acid to have a pH between ~-1 to <7, depending upon how much I add to water. *It can also make sense with pure water, I guess.

This said, to have a pH = 0 a solution should have a very high concentration of H+ - so high that it deviates from ideality. Thus a solution of, say, 1 M HCl does not have a pH of 0, but somewhat higher. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure pH of zero is possible it just requires a concentration of 1M of H+. That is 1 mole of hydrogen ions per litre of solute. This is because pH is defined as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion activity, aH+, in a solution. Note the concentration of hydrogen ions can be even higher than this in some cases resulting in a negative pH like in superacids like Fluoroantimonic acid which has a pH of -31.3 ",
