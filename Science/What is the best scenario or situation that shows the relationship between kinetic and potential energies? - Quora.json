            "answer_text": "Take 92 protons and stuff those 92 positive charges into a 0.000000000000002 meter sphere. The Coulomb repulsive force between any two of them is on average 0.000000000000000000000000000004 times what it is when they are a meter apart. The force starts out small and ends up huge. Well, it takes a lot of energy to squeeze all those protons into a tiny space, a lot of energy to overcome that force. So much so that this potential energy is actually weighable! Actually shows up as part of the mass property associated with the energy in a nucleus. Once they are squeezed together, this is potential energy. Now if there were only some way to release that potential energy \u2026  ",
