            "answer_text": "The initial energy is . Replacing  with  results in , or simply  by cancellation of the one-half and two. It is evident that the energy is directly proportional to the mass for any given velocity. Of course, doubling the velocity will quadruple the energy. That is one of the reasons why a collision at 100kph is much, much worse than a collision at 10kph, not simply ten times worse. A great deal of concern in a collision is safe deceleration and energy dissipation. ",

            "answer_text": "Matter is neither created nor destroyed. But if you somehow managed to add some mass to a moving object, you\u2019d have to add more energy. Nothing will happen to the kinetic energy if you don\u2019t add any. Energy is neither created nor destroyed. So the velocity would reduce to about 70%. A slightly better question: How much energy would I have to add to a moving object if I added enough additional mass to double its initial mass and kept the velocity of the composite object the same?

            "answer_text": "Doubling mass doubles the kinetic energy when velocity remains constant. Consider E=(0.5)(m)(v^2). On the LHS, we have kinetic energy which we want to track. 0.5 is a constant. And you say velocity does not change so yo can assume even v to be a constant. So E=k(m). Which means kinetic energy is directly proportional to mass. So doubling mass will double the kinetic energy. ",
