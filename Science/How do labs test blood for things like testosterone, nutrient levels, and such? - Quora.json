            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a big question. There are many different kinds of tests with a number of methods for determining levels. Here is a brief overview of a basic clinical laboratory significantly simplified. Hematology- Testing here includes but is not limited to blood cell counts and a determination of cell types. The instrument looking at this measures the flow of cells across an electric field to determine size and concentration. A technologist with a microscope may verify the cell types. Chemistry- This is where the testing for things like you blood sugar and electrolytes are completed. The instrument that looks at these uses chemical reactions and different wavelengths of light to determine concentrations. Electrolytes are generally measured using ion selective electrodes. Immuno-chemistry- Testing for the levels of hormones, tumor markers, and other substances found in very small amounts use antibodies and/or antigens to tag the analyte being tested with chemiluminescent dyes. The light from the dyes are used to determine the amount of the substance being tested for. Immuno-hematology (blood banking) determines the blood type and compatibility of donated blood with someone who needs it. This can be done manually or automated. Microbiology- Determines if an infection exists and identifies the type of infection. There are too many pieces involved to detail but this is also a combination of manual and automated methods. Others not included are coagulation, urinalysis, cytology\u2026. The most direct answer to your question falls under immuno-chemistry but the \u201cand such\u201d opens it up. I hope this helps. Few people understand the complex work Clinical Laboratory Scientists do behind the closed doors in the lab. ",
