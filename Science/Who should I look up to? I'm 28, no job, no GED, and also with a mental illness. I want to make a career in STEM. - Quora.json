            "answer_text": "Start with getting your GED. No matter what else, that has to be taken care of first. What type of STEM career are you interested in? Why are you interested in it? If it\u2019s just for money, find something else. Science takes hard work to learn, jobs aren\u2019t always available or good, or reliable. STEM can mean anything from wetlands ecology to biotech engineering, astrophysics to herpetology. If you\u2019re passionate about freshwater entomology, that\u2019s really cool but fairly niche with low job demand. Is there a workforce center you can go to (once the CV19 is over)? Talk to people who\u2019s job it is to help you find a job. 28 is not too late, you are not too old to start a new career in STEM, but you are going to have to work hard, be smart about it, and hustle your ass off. So start with the GED and get a job in a scientific company. A lot of science is boring ass scut work, and you should be able to find a job that only requires a GED. You might do seasonal work for a state agriculture department like monitoring invasive insect traps. Or working in a biotech company sterilizing glassware and making stock chemicals. Or work in a University in the Agriculture Research greenhouses. Whatever. Get a job and start building connections and people who will vouch for you. If you really want a career instead of a job you will have to get at least a bachelors, minimum. For that, you need references, people who will write letters of recommendation for you. Be a stellar employee, no discipline problems, always on time and ready to go, prove your work ethic and on the job innovation. THIS MATTERS MORE THAN ANYTHING!! For better or worse, Universities and colleges run on reputation and social connections. I *cannot* stress how important recommendation letters are, especially for someone who isn\u2019t a conventional student. I go to the University of Minnesota, I\u2019m 40 years old in the middle of getting a Masters of Biological Science, from the College of Continuing and Professional Studies. Universities will have a department or program for non-conventional students, which is you. Work with them. Be persistent AF. Expect to have at least one round of rejection in the process of getting accepted into an undergraduate program. Get everything you can do to manage your mental illness, whatever it is. You will have to deal with rejection, you will have to be your fiercest supporter and advocate. People will help you, advisors and councilors will help, a good TA is amazing, but nobody else has as much invested in your success but you - and nobody else will pay the price of your failure as much as you. You have to have the discipline and focus to work hard and study hard, even if that means managing depression, ADHD, and anxiety - been there, done that. Good luck! ",
