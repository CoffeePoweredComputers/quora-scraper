            "answer_text": "Basically, water has absolutely no color whatsoever to it although many people think it\u2019s blue. It is transparent/clear because it\u2019s made up of 2 gases, Hydrogen and Oxygen and in their natural state, these gases are invisible to the eye. [Sorry, I can\u2019t get into the specifics of all this scientifically because I\u2019m not an expert; just pulling out of my memory banks]. However, water can appear different colors, dependent upon what solids may be in it, like algae, sand, sediment, clay on the bottom of a river, etc. For example, say the Northeast Coast of the United States, where the water often looks murky. It\u2019s because of silt and sediment that gets stirred up. But the water in, say, the Caribbean looks crystal clear turquoise (changing from light aqua in the shallows to dark blue in deeper water), because the sandy bottom is made up of broken bits of shell and coral, etc. and a) that is heavier and doesn\u2019t get stirred up as much as it does up the east coast, and b) it\u2019s bleached by the sun and fairly light in color. Water can also appear to look blue (usually) depending upon how the light is absorbs/refracted, since it absorbs the color red and refracts blue (sorry, but you\u2019ll have to look up the specifics of that if you want to, I\u2019m not expert enough to explain it concisely and with the accurate lingo, etc). This relates to how our eyes/retinas see color. Anyway, hope this layperson\u2019s explanation made sense and helped a little bit. I like the topic. ",

            "answer_text": "When water is in small quantities (e.g. in a glass) it appears colorless to the human eye While relatively small quantities of water appear to be colorless, water's tint becomes a deeper blue as the thickness of the observed sample increases. The blue hue of water is an intrinsic property and is caused by the selective absorption and scattering of white light. Impurities dissolved or suspended in water may give water different colored appearances. The intrinsic color of liquid water may be demonstrated by looking at a white light source through a long pipe that is filled with purified water and closed at both ends with a transparent window. The light turquoise blue color is caused by weak absorption in the red part of the visible spectrum Many people wander why water has a clear, pristine appearance while so many other liquids seem to have at least minimal color. The answer is a complex one and it all begins with the molecular make-up water. Water is entirely composed of hydrogen and oxygen. Both elements are gases in nature and are invisible. ",
