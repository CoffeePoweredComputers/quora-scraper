            "answer_text": "Criminology isn\u2019t an applied science. It\u2019s a SOCIAL science like sociology which it is closely related to. Criminology is all about developing theories about why one child becomes a criminal and another doesn\u2019t. Is it because they have different natures? Or because the child who becomes a criminal grew up in a house where there were no books and they were beaten daily by parents who were bad role models. It asks how do we stop recidivism? Is sending criminals to prison likely to reform them or will they just learn more about crime there. And so on. ",
