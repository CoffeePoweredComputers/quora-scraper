            "answer_text": "In an atom, electrons are arranged according to energy levels or shells. Within each shell are one or more orbitals aka. subshells. S subshell : a spherical orbital which contains upto 2 electrons. Each energy level has one s subshell.P subshell : set of 3 oblong orbitals, arranged perpendicularly. Each of these orbitals can contain up to 2 electrons, so a fully-filled p subshell will contain 6 electrons. The p subshell can be found in energy levels of two or higher.D subshell : set of 5 orbitals, which lie along the x, y, and z planes. Each of the five orbitals can contain up to 2 electrons, so a fully loaded d subshell will contain 10 electrons. This subshell can be found in energy levels of three or higher.F subshell : set of 7 orbitals, symmetrically distributed throughout x, y, and z planes. Each of the seven orbitals can contain up to 2 electrons, totally 14 electrons in a full shell. This subshell can be found in energy levels of four or higher. PS. the graphic does not show the z plane for the p & d orbitals. ",
