            "answer_text": "The four group 3 elements are scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium. \u201clanthanide\u201d refers to the elements between lanthanum and lutetium. That term does not encompass scandium and yttrium. Scandium and yttrium act pretty much identically to lanthanides. I've worked and published extensively with both as well as various lanthanides*. I could call myself a \u201clanthanide chemist\u201d but I prefer the more accurate term \u201crare earth chemist\u201d. This phrase includes the first three group 3 elements as well. Group three metals are not transition metals. They are in the d block but they basically do not exhibit multiple oxidation states. They are sometimes classed as \u201cmain group\u201d because they have superficially similar chemistry to alkaline earth metals, except they are 3+ rather than 2+ in the latter.they are sometimes referred to as \u201cf block\u201d because of the essentially identical reactivity to the lanthanides, but this is also inaccurate as they do not have an f electrons in their atomic confifuration. The most accurate description is \u201crare earth\u201d. Because they don't change oxidation state, most of their reactions go by sigma bond metathesis routes, a lovely and simple mechanism to draw! Like the lanthanides it is their size, rather than their electronic configuration that distinguishes them chemically. I.e. if you want to do rare earth catalysis you will probably screen for a range of them because they will likely have similar reactivities but have different rates. Sometimes you can slightly tweak your metal centre and reactions that did not go before are suddenly very facile.** Sm and Ce are more willing to change oxidation state so they can react differently. I hope this helps! * Ive used them all except Pm, Tb and Tm at some point, as well as 6 months dabbling in uranium chemistry. ** see Scandium-catalysed intermolecular hydroaminoalkylation of olefins with aliphatic tertiary amines. This is my selective screening table for this reaction from this paper: you'll see that whilst certain Sc species catalyse the reaction, the equivalent Y, Lu, Gd and Sm did not. I'm sure I tried others as well but the results were probably not clear enough to publish.  ",

            "answer_text": "I think the most mysterious,beautiful and useful elements in our world is Group 3,4,5,6 and 7 elements.And know it is time to meet you up with Group 3 elements. 1.Boron.   2. Aluminium.  3.Gallium. This is the only metal that melts in room temperature and in human hand.Pure gallium is not a harmful substance for humans to touch. It has been handled many times only for the simple pleasure of watching it melt by the heat emitted from a human hand. However, it is known to leave a stain on hands. Some gallium compounds can actually be very dangerous.   4.Indium. Indium is a moderately toxic metal by inhalation and mildly toxic by ingestion. However, the exact nature of its human toxicity is not clearly understood. Indium is a soft, malleable metal with a brilliant lustre.  5.Thallium. Before the widespread application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, was the main substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).   6. Ununutrium.   All the Best. ",
