            "answer_text": "There are two parts to this question: What is metaphysics? Formally, it is the study of being (of being qua being, Aristotle would add) or ontology. It aims to provide the most basic grasp of reality or what is, that includes both actual existence (in space-time) and possible existence, as well as an account of what kind of being things like sets and abstractions have.Does the study of metaphysics yield knowledge. Many have thought so, and indeed thought that they could have secure, even certain knowledge. This would involve a grasp of the basic truths of reality.My own view is that while there are various metaphysical proposals, none rises to the level of secure knowledge. Some metaphysical beliefs are better than others though. ",

            "answer_text": "Metaphysics traditionally meant anything beyond physics. This was relegated to first causes and other things considered \u201cunknowable\u201d to those like ourselves separated from Absolute.[1] Today, Metaphysics has a meatier definition thanks to recent work in philosophy[2] : \u201ca person\u2019s most general attempt at making sense of things\u201d or something like that. It has to do with the assumptions we accept about how the world works in fundamental ways, and it\u2019s about how we construct reality for ourselves on an individual basis.
