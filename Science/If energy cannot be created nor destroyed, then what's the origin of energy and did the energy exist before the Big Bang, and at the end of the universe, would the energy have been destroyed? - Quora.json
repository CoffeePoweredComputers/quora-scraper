            "answer_text": " First you have to understand which came first - The Chicken or the Egg\u2026 In Science, Chicken is Matter and Egg is Energy. My answer to the riddle is Chicken!!!! Matter was created first. To understand that, you have to understand what my theory - The Hypergeometrical Universe Theory (HU) says about matter. In HU, matter is made directly and simply from deformations of Space. This means that in the Universe, there is space, space deformations and time. Nothing else. So, my theory provides the simplest possible model for the Universe and thus it allows for the Simplest Model for Cosmogenesis.(The Creation of the Cosmos or The Creation of the Universe). So, to create the whole Universe, I just had to justify the spontaneous appearance of a metric fluctuation. Metric is the function that allows for the calculation of distances in space. So a metric fluctuation is a perturbation of space such that distances changes. This is not inflation, where distances are inflated once by a never-seen-before-never-seen-later process and remained inflated forever. My metric fluctuation is of the old kind, supported by the Heisenberg Principle\u2026.:) It would normally just disappear (recombining dilation regions with contraction ones). Now that we have a mechanism for the creation of the Initial Fluctuation, let talk about its shape:  This is a 2S atomic orbital. Notice that it has one boundary between the white and the red regions. It is not a perfect drawing since the white region should span the whole center of the orbital\u2026 so the core is white..:) and there is only one boundary. This would be fine if the Universe were a 2D Surface. It is a 3D Hypersurface, instead. So, you should add one extra dimension to this drawing (the radius becomes a 4D radius) and the surface becomes a 3D Hypersurface. Now the final touch is to associate red with contraction and white with dilation. This configuration can follow two paths. The boundary can move while red and white regions recombine, or you can have a partial recombination, where only the last contraction layer and the inner dilation layer remains. That path has a physical mock model. It is called the Prince Rupert Drop:  Notice how the inner dilation results in the explosion of the outermost contraction layer (3:30 in the video). This is not the same as the Universe being accelerated to the speed of light but it is close. In the Universe, the inner dilation trails the Universe after the contraction layer broke into pieces and became a Blackholium (hyperspherical Black Hole). Here is the full description: Marco Pereira's post in Hypergeometrical Universe WHEN WAS ENERGY FINALLY RELEASED? The energy was finally released during he decay of the Neutronium!! So, each hydrogen atom gained 0.78 MeV of energy and that was what created the hot plasma. No BS about Antimatter Asymmetry or Inflation or Rollover\u2026etc. IN SUMMARY Chicken came first. Egg came later. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at an experiment that you can do at home to help you understand how available energy can exist at once and then be lost, because it changes into something else: Take a container of sugar water (water with sugar dissolved in it) and place a string with a sugar crystal at the end into the water. The sugar water has the electromagnetic energy (available energy to do work) to bring the sugar in the liquid to attach it to the sugar on the string, thus expanding the sugar crystal. Where is the original available energy in the fluid to do the work of expanding the crystal? The energetic, active, available, potential, implicit energy has become wrapped up in the explicit shape of the sugar crystal (It is only lost in that, at the moment, it can not do as much work as it originally could do). Given enough time all the potential sugar will be removed from the original solution and bound up into a very large sugar crystal. At that time, we say that entropy (the total running down of available energy) has run its course. So now let\u2019s see what we learned about the creation and destruction of available energy. Energy is not destroyed, only its potential is wrapped up into other forms. Like the creation of crystals, gravitational wells are formed in our universe. They are thought to be ground states of this potential/available energy, but just because the energy is not available anymore, doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t exist. A crystal or a solid or a black hole gravity well is the product of energy that was once available to do work. Now that energy is doing the work of holding the crystal (and by analogy, the universe) together. At first a black hole seems to take all of the available energy wrapped up in the four force fields (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear forces). But Hawking says that when all of the space is removed (from within all the force fields), the curvature of these supermassive black holes gets so curved that it breaks down all the forces between the most infinitessimal energy-packets/radiation, releasing all the original energy that once was wrapped up in the black hole. The same thing happens in water-based honey droplets in oil. Oil and honey are, at first, immiscible (they don\u2019t mix), but given enough time the interfacial tension between them breaks down (interfacial tension goes to zero) and the water-based honey dissipates into the oil. Just as the supermassive black hole dissipates into a nearly coherent potential universe with energy that is available again to do work. ",
