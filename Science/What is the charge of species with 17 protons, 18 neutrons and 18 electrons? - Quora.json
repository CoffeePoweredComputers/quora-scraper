            "answer_text": "Proton is the positively charged particle with a charge equivalent to 1.6*(10^-19) C = +e(say). Neutron is a neutral charged particle i.e. zero charge. Electrons are negatively charged particle with a charge equivalent to {-1.6*(10^-19)} C =-e. Protons and Neutrons are inside the nucleus of an atom and contribute to the most of the mass of the atom. Electrons are revolving around the positively charged nucleus in quantized energy shells. Total negative charges = number of electrons = 6*(-e) = -18e Total positive charges = number of protons = 4*e = 17e Neutrons are neutral, so zero charge. Effective charge on atom = (17\u201318)e = -1e = -1.6*(10^-19) C Or it's an effective one negative charge on the atom. ",

            "answer_text": "As we know electron and proton charge is equal and opposite. In an atom number of proton and electrons are equal hence atom in electrically neutral. Coming to you\u2019r case There are 17 p , 18 n, and 18 e as we know electron and proton charge is equal and opposite so it\u2019s charge is -1 because of one extra electron. Further A = No.of p + No. of n so it\u2019s atomic mass is 17+18 = 35 which is mass of Chlorine atom. And it\u2019s a normal case where chlorine gained one electron and got stable Noble gas configuration. ",
