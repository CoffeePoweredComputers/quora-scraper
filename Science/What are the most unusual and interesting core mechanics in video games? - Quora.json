            "answer_text": "My First Quantum Translocator is almost like Portal, except instead of portals, you can leave a \"shadow\" that you can teleport back to at any time, although it has a cooldown. Qoosh is like Portal, except you can teleport almost anywhere you want within a certain radius around you. Second Person Shooter Zato is not as much a puzzle, but it is based around a unique mechanic. As can be discovered by the title, it is a second person shooter, where instead looking through the eyes of yourself, you are looking through the eyes of the enemies as they approach you. And lastly, One Step Back is a puzzle game where at intervals, the entrance doors spawn a copy of you that take your exact movements as they occurred when you first moved. If you touch your past bodies, your clones, you lose and have to restart the level. ",
