            "answer_text": "The key to living our lives to the fullest is to simply care less about what others think. There\u2019s a fine line between doing what we want versus being disrespectful don\u2019t get me wrong, but more often than not I find that I hold myself out of fear of being judged. The reality is we waste tons of energy trying to maintain a public image when people could honestly care less. Our self-perception isn\u2019t limited to how we view ourselves, it\u2019s also what think others view us as. I call these self-limiting beliefs.  You\u2019ve probably heard this answer a million times. Living by our own standards instead of other peoples expectations is repackaged in dozens of ways and fed back to us all the time. Books like The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson, quotes from movies like \u201cFight Club\u201d (which was released almost 20 years ago by the way), and comics like the one above all convey the same message. It\u2019s a testament to how valuable this tip is; so why aren\u2019t we living by it everyday? The truth is, ignoring other peoples opinion\u2019s to commit to our own is a lot harder than it sounds. For example, as much as I know dropping my life to live abroad in another country for a year would be an amazing experience, it\u2019s terribly frightening to make it happen. That sort of drastic change comes with sacrifice. Going against the grain to do what we think is right also involves breaking out of our safe zone. Living by our own expectations can dramatically change our relationships with the people around us! Staying selfish despite what your family expects of you, being the person who speaks their mind against their boss for something they believe is right, or saying no to your close friends when they want to have fun can bring forward tough ramifications.  \u201cLiving life to our fullest\u201d isn\u2019t all what it\u2019s cracked up to be. Personally I\u2019ve lost many friends who I valued dearly as I shed old values. I\u2019ve also made new friends as I picked up new habits, but it can be hard to find that spark without a shared history. Staying with what\u2019s comfortable and familiar is easier. On the flip-side, I\u2019ve noticed focusing on what we want causes two things to happen: It moves control over our lives from other peoples hands into our ownIt involves embracing who we really are and letting the world judge it however they wantBy shedding the weight of outside opinion we embark on our own unique journey. It\u2019s only when we start living our lives for ourselves that we start to live our lives to the fullest. Thanks for reading. If you like what you see feel free to follow me on Quora. I\u2019m also open to any direct messages for feedback, thoughts, and suggestions. ",

            "answer_text": "What I have become today within these 22 years is a complicated person, a mixing blend of positive and negative aura. I am still at this stage of exploring and discovering things which would define the real me. But one thing is for sure.. I don't want to regret a thing in my life.Just like any articles posted all over the net, I want to list down all the things I want to share to those of you who spend time to read this. Some of these are cliche, but I totally agree and live by it. Lessons learned are:1. Don't try to please everyone, you just can't. Be yourself. If someone doesn't like you, you don't have to change yourself and apologize to him/her. We all have different personalities. It is normal for a clash.2. Never feel inferior to anyone. Even if it is your boss, a geek, or some pretty face, you shouldn't be frightened or intimidated by his position or skills. We are all created equally. You also have some traits they just can't have.3. Always treat your misfortune or missed opportunity in your favor.Believe that any unfulfilled dream or mistakes are part of reaching your true destiny. These things only redirect you to the path where you should be.4. Don't be a puppet. Do not be controlled by people around you. It is your life you are living. No one should dictate what you should try and take in life.5. Dream. Make plans. If Plan A failed, there are 25 more plans to go.6. Learn to wait. Wishes and dreams are not for instant. It takes time. The longer you wait and the harder you work for it, the more fruitful it would become.7. Critics are everywhere. Whatever you do, may it be good or bad, someone will always notice and judge you. You should not give a shit about them. You know yourself better.8. Family, friends, do not forget them.We all have priorities in life, but one should not forget to allocate time for their loved ones. You can not turn back the hands of time.9. Trust is everything in a relationship.When you say you trust a person, it means you believe in anything that person would say. You believe in him no matter what. And when they say you are trusted, make sure you are completely honest. Trust is what keeps you related to the person. Sometimes, broken trust entails relationship over.10. Believe in Him. I am not the type who is religious. But I must say that He is there through my ups and downs. Trust him and raise it all to Him. He got you.It turns out you can not simply know and understand how it feels to be 22 until you are actually living it. Commitments. Responsibilities. Relationships. Career. These are just words, 22 is just a number, there is more to life. Color it! ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest answer should be by \u2018Living in the moment.\u2019 I would like to share a parable from The Book of Virtues by William.J.Bennett, about which even Robin Sharma mentioned in his book \u201cThe monk who sold his Ferrari\u201d. It is named as \u201cThe Magic Thread\u201d This might be quite long, but definitely worth the time! It goes something like this.. Peter was an ardent daydreamer. When he was in school, he dreamt of playing outside; when he was playing outside, he dreamed of his summer vacations. He never bothered to savour the special moments that were flying by. Often he wandered through the forest, dreaming of the future. One such day, he began to grow sleepy, so he lay down on the soft forest floor under the warm sun. As he began to fall asleep, he heard a voice calling his name. As he slowly opened his eyes, he saw an old woman standing before him. She held a silver ball in her hand, from which dangled a silken gold thread. \u201cPeter!\u201d She started, \u201cthis is the thread of your life. If you pull the thread just a bit, an hour will pass in seconds. If you pull harder, whole days will pass in minutes. And if you pull with all your might, months \u2013 even years \u2013 will pass by in days.\u201d Peter was very excited and enquired if he could have that thread. The elderly woman quickly reached down and gave the ball with the magic thread to the young boy. The next day, Peter was sitting in the classroom feeling restless and bored. Suddenly, he remembered his new toy. As he pulled a little bit of the golden thread, he quickly found himself playing in his garden. Realising the magic he had in his hands, Peter soon grew tired of being a schoolboy and longed to be a teenager, with all the excitement that phase of life would bring. So again he held the ball and pulled hard on the golden thread. Suddenly, he was a teenager with a very pretty girlfriend named Elise. His teenage was short-lived as boredom struck him hard. He wasn't content. He now dreamed of being an adult, so again he pulled hard on the thread and many years flew by in an instant. Now he found that he was transformed into a middle-aged uncle. Elise was now his wife and Peter was surrounded by a houseful of kids. He noticed that his once jet-black hair had started to turn grey and his once youthful mother, whom he loved so dearly had grown pale, weak and frail. Peter wasn't delighted with that either. So once again, he pulled on the magic thread and waited for the changes to appear. Peter now found that he was in his nineties. His thick hair had turned white and thin and the love of his life, Elise, had also grown old and had passed away a few years earlier.His wonderful children had grown up and left home to lead lives of their own. For the first time in his entire life, Peter realised that he had not taken the time to embrace the wonders of living. He had never spent quality time with his kids or went for a long walk with Elise. He had never planted a garden nor had he read out those wonderful books to his children which his mother read. Instead, he had hurried through life, never resting to relish the journey. Peter became very sad at this discovery. He decided to go out to the forest where he used to walk as a boy to clear his head and warm his spirit. He laid down on a small patch of grass and instantly dozed off. After only a minute, he heard someone calling out to him. He looked up in astonishment to see that old woman who had given him the ball with the magic golden thread many years earlier. \u201cHow have you enjoyed my special gift?\u201d she asked. \u201cAt first it was fun, but now I hate it.\u201d he responded bluntly, \u201cMy whole life has passed before my eyes without giving me the chance to enjoy it. Sure, there would have been sad times as well as great times, but I haven\u2019t had the chance to experience either. I feel empty inside. I have missed the gift of living.\u201d She remarked Peter\u2019s ungratefulness, but agreed to grant one last wish. \u201cI\u2019d like to go back to being a schoolboy and live my life over again,\u201d Peter immediately exclaimed and returned to sleep. Again, he heard someone calling his name and opened his eyes. He was absolutely delighted to see his mother standing over his bedside. She looked healthy and radiant. Peter realised that the strange woman from the forest had indeed granted his wish and he had returned to his former life. \u201cHurry up, Peter. You are going to get late for school today!\u201d she exclaimed. Needless to say, Peter dashed out of bed and went on to live a full life, the one with equal amounts of joys and sorrows, equal amounts of love and hatred, but it all started when he realized the significance of living in the moment. So when times are hard on you, don\u2019t wish that you could skip ahead to better days. Don\u2019t live constantly looking forward to a holiday. Don\u2019t wish for the time to pass. Rather, savor every moment; live in the present. Life is short, and it is over in a blink. Live it to the fullest. Live in the moment. Cheers. :) MD ",

            "answer_text": "A weird and somewhat morbid thought occurs to me from time to time. When I am on a plane and the turbulence hits, when a car veers out into traffic, when I hear about someone I know who died suddenly: I don\u2019t get scared. I just think, \u201cIf this is it, alright.\u201d This is a wonderful place to be. So while it might seem morbid to say that I\u2019d be happy going at any moment, it\u2019s actually a wonderful way to live. It\u2019s something I feel quite lucky to be able to say. And yet, I also know that it wasn\u2019t a result of luck, but of a certain philosophical way of thinking and, of course, a lot of hard decisions. Here are 40 things that I believe helped me reach this point where I can say, \u201cI\u2019ve lived a full life.\u201d  1. Do Ridiculous Things There\u2019s no story behind how my wife and I came to own a goat except that we asked ourselves: Why not? So we got a goat and had Smitty\u2019s BBQ on the way home and called it a day.  2. Not What Will Pay The Most, But What Will Teach Me The Most? This is how I have evaluated my career and job opportunities (and book projects too). There are lots of ways to make money, fewer real opportunities to learn. 3. Quit Dicking Around The books I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to write were not the result of mad sprints of intensity. I get up every day and work on them. One right after another. While I\u2019m waiting for one to come back from the printer, I am hard at work on the next one. Basically, I\u2019m not dicking around. 30 years is so much time. One year is so much time. Wake up every day and do a little more. Dick around a little less. See what happens. 4. \u201cThe Right Time is Right Now.\u201d This is Casey Neistat\u2019s line. It\u2019s great. When I moved to a farm, do you know how many people I heard from telling me they\u2019ve always wanted to do that? Let me tell you, it wasn\u2019t a tough vetting process. It\u2019s not like getting into Harvard. If you think you want to do it, do it. 5. Get Married. Be in a Long Term Relationship. People say they want to end up with someone, they say they want to get married someday, and then what do they do? Everything but what makes that possible. Pick a person and be in a relationship already. It\u2019s the best thing you will ever do. It\u2019s a lot of work. It will be painful and tough at times. But it is better than the affluenza of Tinder. I\u2019m not saying settle, but I am saying that relationships are great because you make them great, not because you search until you magically find one that\u2019s already perfect. And enough with this polyamory nonsense. Maybe it makes .01% of the population happier, but the fact that they need to sell everyone on it so much makes me think it\u2019s probably not working for them either. Neil Strauss wrote a wonderful book about this, don\u2019t waste a decade of your life being an idiot. 6. Steer Clear of Charlatans and the Toxic Regular friend purges are a must. So are influence purges (the sources of information you follow). You become who you know. You conform to your surroundings. Make sure those two facts are taking you in a direction you want to go. 7. Keep a Journal Each morning, usually after a long walk on my farm, I go upstairs to my office and pull out three small notebooks. In the first one\u2014a small blue gold leafed notebook\u2014I write one sentence about the day that just passed. In the next, a black moleskine, I journal two quick pages about yesterday\u2019s workout (how far I ran or swam), what work I did, any notable occurrences, and some lines about what I am grateful for, what I want to get better at, and where I am succeeding. And then finally, I pick up The Daily Stoic Journal to prepare for the day ahead by meditating on a short prompt: Where am I standing in my own way? What\u2019s the smallest step I can take toward a big thing today? What blessings can I count right now? Why do I care so much about impressing people? What is the harder choice I\u2019m avoiding? Do I rule my fears, or do they rule me? How will today\u2019s difficulties show my character? The whole ritual takes maybe 15 minutes and then it\u2019s done. By the time I am finished, I am centered, I am calm and most importantly, I am primed to do the actual creative work by which I make my living. 8. Hell Yes or Hell No is Too Simple Most of the best decisions I made would have failed that test. I was scared. I had doubts. I didn\u2019t know if it was what I really wanted. Life is complicated and life decisions are about weighing the odds, not black and white certainties. 9. Live in New York or Los Angeles (Or a City Like That) \u2026but not for long. It\u2019s good to test yourself in a big city. It\u2019s good to feel the energy of millions of people coursing through your veins. But leave before you become jaded by it or addicted to it. Leave before it changes your lifestyle. 10. The Quiet Moments Are The Best There is a line from Lao Tzu. \u201cPeace is in the emptiness. Emptiness is in the fast of the mind.\u201d It\u2019s in the quiet, still moments that we feel what matters in life. Standing on the shore of a lake. Looking out over a canyon. Resting your head against someone else\u2019s. It\u2019s a shortage of these moments that give rise to the feeling that we haven\u2019t lived enough, that we have to keep going. Seeking them out, encouraging them is what makes you feel like you\u2019ve done plenty. 11. Have a Philosophy Pete Carroll talks about his turning point as a coach, when he realized he was just winging it. So he stopped and wrote down his entire coaching philosophy. Now he has something to measure himself against. \u201cMan is pushed by drives,\u201d Viktor Frankl once observed, \u201cbut he is pulled by values.\u201d What are those values? When presented with a choice\u2013which path do you choose? What rules do you live by? Well, what\u2019s yours? Don\u2019t wing it through your 20s. Sketch them out. They\u2019re easier to follow that way. Focus. Live by something. 12. Make Time For Real Philosophy Too As Seneca said, \u201cOf all people, only those are at leisure who make time for philosophy, only those are really alive. For they not only keep a good watch over their own lifetimes, but they annex every age to theirs.\u201d 13. Exercise Every Single Day Don\u2019t let yourself get to the point where you feel like some day in the future you\u2019d like to lose weight or be in shape. Be in shape. Make exercise part of your job, part of your duties as a human being. Let endorphins be something you give yourself every day.  14. Don\u2019t Compare Yourself To Other People Caesar famously wept at the feet of a statue of Alexander the Great. \u201cDo you not think it is matter for sorrow that while Alexander, at my age, was already king of so many peoples, I have as yet achieved no brilliant success?\u201d he http://said.Um, you were both fucking terrible. And now you\u2019re both gone. Who cares whether so-and-so did this or that earlier than you? Who cares that so-and-so had more? 15. Sooner Is Not Better I had this idea that I wanted to be a millionaire by 25. Where this number came from, I don\u2019t know. I made it up, it was ego, and I didn\u2019t hit it. But you know what the difference of getting there a little later was? Nothing. No one throws you a party. Accomplishments don\u2019t change who you are. 16. Meditate on Your Mortality The whole point of this post: Don\u2019t shy away from thinking about death. Reminding ourselves each day that we will die helps us treat our time as a gift. Someone on a deadline doesn\u2019t indulge himself with attempts at the impossible, he doesn\u2019t waste time complaining about how he\u2019d like things to be. They figure out what they need to do and do it, fitting in as much as possible before the clock expires. They figure out how, when that moment strikes, to say, Of course, I would have liked to last a little longer, but I made a lot of out what I was already given so this works too. Think about death a lot. I like Marcus Aurelius\u2019s line: \u201cAre you afraid of death because you won\u2019t be able to do this anymore?\u201d For \u201cthis\u201d plug in so much of the crap we waste our time with.  17. Be Responsible I have a life insurance policy. I have money saved. If something happens to me, people I care about will be taken care of. The Avocado Toast guy was right. A lot of people are spending money on shit they can\u2019t afford and then they want to blame other people for it. 18. But Not Too Responsible The reason they will be taken care of and that I feel creatively and professionally satisfied, is that I have taken a lot of big risks. I dropped out of college (this gave me a two-year head start on a lot of people). I left a good job. I bit off more than I could chew many times. 19. The Two Play Off Each Other Why could I take those risks? Because I had been responsible. I had money saved. I knew what was important to me. I had built a support network. I eliminated the tiny risks so I could take the right ones. I wasn\u2019t spinning the \u201cHow will I pay my bills this month?\u201d wheel like so many people unnecessarily are. As I said, do the irresponsible things\u200a\u2014\u200abecause it averages out the ultra-responsible choices you made elsewhere. 20. Don\u2019t Live Like Every Day Is Your Last In The Daily Stoic, I say that living every day like it\u2019s your last is insane. That would mean zero planning or foresight. Instead, live like it\u2019s the last day of before a deployment. You\u2019d handle your business. You\u2019d spend time with loved ones. You\u2019d cherish your alone time. You\u2019d have fun. That\u2019s how you should live day to day. 21. Travel (With Purpose) Nothing has wasted more millennial time than the cult of travel for its own sake. So you\u2019ve been to Africa? And? So you\u2019ve spent a month in hostels in Thailand? Yes? What did you really learn there, that you couldn\u2019t have gotten from some other source? What did you really do? What was the purpose of any of it? Wisdom doesn\u2019t come from going places. Not if you, as Emerson said, \u201cbrought ruins to ruins.\u201d 22. Be Prematurely Old I\u2019ve always had trouble relating to kids in my generation. Other than my wife and a few exceptions, most of my friends are much older and always seem to have been. As I\u2019ve achieved some semblance of success, my peers have tended to be older too. The result is that I feel old all the time. When I hear someone say they are \u2018adulting\u2019 like it\u2019s a funny exception to how they normally are, I think, \u201cThere is a person who is going to wake up one day and think about where all the years went.\u201d But when you hear someone is an \u201cold soul,\u201d you think, \u201cMan, they have their shit together.\u201d Young people are stupid. Old people are wise. Which do you want to be? 23. Remember the Law of Diminishing Returns For instance with travel\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s great, but two years of backpacking through Europe is two years of your life. Who is to say you have that much time? Chances are, at some point, you extracted most of the value of whatever it is you\u2019re doing, but you\u2019re just coasting now. A year in New York can be transformative, ten years will ossify you. Be willing to call things when the diminishing returns set in, it\u2019s how you move on when others are stuck. 24. Study the Lives of the Greats Read Plutarch. Read Vasari. Read Caro\u2019s biographies of LBJ. Not to compare yourself, as I said, but to learn. The dissections of the lives of powerful, ambitious people will teach you so much, and save you some much pain and heartache and disaster. 25. Don\u2019t Waste Time Being Offended God, how much precious energy is spilled fighting online, shouting in other people\u2019s faces. A well-ordered person never thinks, \u201cHow dare they?\u201d because they don\u2019t have those kinds of expectations of other people and they don\u2019t think their own feelings are other people\u2019s problem. 26. Buy a House Not at 20, not before you can afford it obviously, and not some expensive albatross that weighs you down, but something reasonable, that you love. If I had bought an apartment I\u2019d look at when I was 22, I don\u2019t know if I would have left my job to become a writer. If I hadn\u2019t bought a house when I was 26, I don\u2019t think I would have truly understood what I wanted out of life and where I was happy\u200a\u2014\u200aI\u2019d still be moving, still be too busy. Owning a home is having a home. It\u2019s somewhere I want to get back to. The center I revolve around. My friend Nils likes to say that people who don\u2019t own walls with art on them are running from something. I think he\u2019s right. 27. Work a Lot Everyone loves to repeat that line, \u201cOn your deathbed, you won\u2019t be happy you worked so much.\u201d Um, I\u2019m very proud of what I do. I will be reflecting happily on all of it. What no one sits there and thinks is how glad they are that they got good at video games, how many restaurants they ate at, the time they spent chasing girls or boys, or political arguments they got into. There are many many many more wasteful and regrettable things we do than work.Pouring yourself into something you believe contributes to the world is one of the best ways to feel content and accomplished. Don\u2019t sell this short. 28. Drive across the United States No one should die before they have done this. 29. Psychedelics Are A Dead End I certainly have smart friends who will disagree with this, but I haven\u2019t heard a single person tell me something they learned on psychotropic drugs that couldn\u2019t have been learned quietly sitting with their own thoughts. I haven\u2019t heard anything from them that I haven\u2019t heard in a book. If your trip to the jungle in Peru is the magical solution to all your problems, you\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed. You\u2019re looking for shortcuts. Life is not found in shortcuts, but in doing the hard stuff (and if it really did work, then why are do they need to them over and over and over again? Hallucinogens are to insight what Oxy is to pain relief). 30. Don\u2019t Be A Hater My biggest regret is time I have spent being envious or jealous or hating. Hating doesn\u2019t make anyone better. It only makes you unhappier. \u201cHate will get you every time.\u201d Life is too short. Find what you love about people, what you can be grateful for in them, even if that is a minor part of them. 31. Read Books. Lots of Them Any fool can learn by experience, I prefer to learn by the experiences of others, is how Bismark put it. The amount of dumb things I\u2019ve managed to avoid because I learned the lesson in advance? Too many to count.  32. Have a Kid I used to see people in restaurants with kids and sort of pity them. The other day I was in a restaurant with my kid, having a great time and then I realized: Shit, these people have been having all the fun. I was the one being an idiot.Obviously, I would like to live until I\u2019m 90 so I can spend as many years as possible with my son, but as Paul Kalanithi says in When Breath Becomes Air, every minute you do have is a blessing and comfort. 33. Seriously, You Can Do Whatever You Want That Steve Jobs line about how the rules were made up by people no smarter than you. Make sure you\u2019re not conforming to needless constraints about how to dress, how to live, what\u2019s important, how things must be done. The more value you deliver in life, the most freedom and power you have. 34. Avoid Competition Sometimes competition makes you better, but more often than not, as Peter Thiel explained, it just eats up resources. Don\u2019t spend precious years of your life in trench warfare or in a stalemate. Go where there is no competition\u200a\u2014\u200aseek out the blue oceans. The best way to do that? Be you. Do only the things you can do. 35. Know Your Why You have to know why you do what you do\u200a\u2014\u200awhat you prize and what\u2019s important to you. Or you will be endlessly comparing yourself against other people, which will not only be a major distraction, it will make you miserable. 36. Know What\u2019s \u201cEnough\u201d If you don\u2019t know what \u201cenough\u201d is, then the default answer is always more. More money, more promotions, more attention. You have to know when you can say no\u200a\u2014\u200aso you don\u2019t overreach and lose it all. 37. Get the Big Things Right There\u2019s the old Benjamin Franklin line about being a penny wise but a pound foolish. It\u2019s the same thing with time management. Most people get the little things right and the big things wrong\u200a\u2014\u200aand then wonder why they don\u2019t get much done. 38. A To-Do List Every Day Every day, have a to-do list. Even on the weekends. A simple, straightforward one. One notecard, 5-6 big items and that\u2019s it. Every day, I cross these off and tear up the card. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the system. Not because it\u2019s about drowning yourself in work, but so you can always be moving forward. Check the stuff off, don\u2019t wing it. Use Tim Ferriss\u2019s question: \u201cIf this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?\u201d  39. Design The Ideal Day So many people have big goals for the future. I think it\u2019s better to know what your perfect day looks like. If you don\u2019t know what your ideal day looks like, how are you ever going to make decisions or plans for ensuring that you actually get to experience them on a regular basis? It\u2019s important to take an inventory of the most enjoyable and satisfying days of your life. What did you do? Why did you like them? Now be sure that your job, personal life, even the place you\u2019ve chosen to live takes you towards these, not away from them. I know my ideal day and more importantly, I know when I have gotten too far from it. Life is too short to not live the way you want. 40. Learning Is Not Enough It\u2019s very easy for learning to go in one ear and out the other. Making a concerted effort to record and process what you\u2019re observing and being taught helps prevent that. If you read a lot, take notes on what you read and transfer those notes into a commonplace book, where you can organize your thoughts. Repeating and reiterating what you\u2019ve learned helps make connections and improve memory. Organizing it into a system means it will be so much easier to retrieve when you need it. *** I\u2019ll end this post with a paragraph from Mozart, who lived to be 35 but filled those years with many, many decades of life and work. \u201cI have now made a habit of being prepared in all affairs of life for the worst. As death, when we come to consider it closely, is the true goal of our existence, I have formed during the last few years such close relationships with this best and truest friend of mankind that his image is not only no longer terrifying to me but is indeed very soothing and consoling, and I thank my God for graciously granting me the opportunity of learning that death is the key which unlocks the door to our true happiness. I never lie down at night without reflecting that\u200a\u2014\u200ayoung as I am\u200a\u2014\u200aI may not live to see another day. Yet not one of all my acquaintances could say that in my company I am morose or disgruntled. For this blessing I daily thank my creator.\u201d  Like to Read?

            "answer_text": " What is that one thing by knowing which everything else becomes known? This is a question of the Mundaka Upanishad. \u2018How does one start living life to the fullest?\u2019 is the same question in a beautiful modern format. I really liked the question. Do you know the Plato\u2019s allegory of cave?  A group of men and women chained to a wall in a huge deep cave, facing a wall only, ever looking at the shadows projected on the wall, of animals and objects crossing the narrow entrance, in the light of huge fire behind them inside the cave. These people believed the shadows alone to be true, and this was their reality! One day, one of them happened to get out of the entrance to the outer world and found the dazzling sun, trees, and nature. He was stupefied. He felt miserable at being so foolish at restricting himself to the confines of the cave. He went inside to share the truth with other prisoners but they called him a heretic. This is our story too. We have created a world of our own with the five senses and the mind (the software) fitted to this physical body (the hardware). We believe only in this. If somebody were to tell us anything other than this, we would consider him foolish. I am presenting a beautiful idea of the conversation of twins by Dr Wayne Dyer, inside the mother's womb, in my own words. First Twin : \u2018Are we ever going to get out of this place?\u2019 Second Twin: \u2018You fool, where do we go? This is our permanent world.\u2019 First Twin: \u2018How long can we be here, there must be some other place that we can go after getting out of our mother\u2019s womb?\u2019 Second Twin: \u2018Fool, where is this mother\u2019s womb? There is no mother or anyone. We are on our own. We will never go anywhere.\u2019 First Twin : \u2018Maybe we are growing and preparing ourselves for some other life outside this place?\u2019 Second Twin: \u2018I have never seen a fool like you. What is this meaningless outside, you are speaking about? Your feeling of \u2018something outside\u2019 is an illusion. There is nothing beyond this. This is everything'. First Twin: \u2018I somehow feel that there is a lot of light outside and a large world waiting for us.\u2019 Second Twin: \u2018You are a real dumb fellow. How do you believe something without perceiving. Perceiving is believing. What is \u2018here and now\u2019 alone is real and there is nothing beyond this'. First Twin: \u2018I have some intuition that we are going to be born into another world where we can walk, run, talk, and enjoy freely without the limitation of the womb and the umbilical cord.\u2019 Second Twin: \u2018I have never seen a fool like you. This alone is true. We will not go anywhere from here'. One who thinks like the first foetus and takes this world as a passing phase and tries to see beyond the senses and mind is actually a wise man of wisdom. He is the one who lives a full life. The other person who thinks like the second foetus and takes this world alone to be real and believes that there is nothing beyond this is a finite miserable person. If we want to live life to the fullest, we have to cross the barrier of the five senses and mind and stop our habituation to time and space. When we understand that this life is just a play, a passing show, we live happily. We do not involve ourselves in meaningless, trivial things like hoarding, showing-off, seeking recognition, and other such exercises that lead to misery. Getting rid of this limitation is bliss. We get rid of misery when we wriggle out of the world created by this gadget of the five senses. This world that is created by the human body limits us to this finite world like the foetus limited to the darkness of the womb. Wake up! See beyond the senses, time and space! That state is the \u201cJust be\u201d state of bliss. Enjoy this bliss.

Get 8 Hours of sleep, No bargain on this one.Wake up early , anything before or at 7AM would work.Do some exercises and go for a long run if you could.Make a Todo List, I recommend use an app on your phone like Any do, Wunderlist, Todoist etc.Keep variety on your task list, doing the same thing over and over again would make you feel bored.Do the most difficult task the first in the day or what they call \u201c Eat the frog in the morning\u201dWhen you undertake a task , Just forget you have anything else to do until you complete it.Realise the power of NOW. If there\u2019s work with a close deadline, Do it Now because next hour would never come.Treat Yourself after you complete one of the task of your list. Anything like a Nap, TV series or Videogames would be the best ones to indulge in.Go for a walk in the evenings without your phone in your hand, Just relish the beauty of nature.Be Concerned about your todo list but don't worry, You would lose the attention on the current task.Have an hour devoid of electronics and anything that matters. Just sit and let the thoughts flow in. It really helps in connecting to oneself.Fix one day a week (maybe a weekend) on which you keep yourself free whole day. Go for a walk, do a party , watch Stupid comedy,Read books , sleep , Play videogames or anything you would like , just don'twork :P .Helps your pump up the enthusiasm for another week.Don't worry if you could not complete the tasks on your to do list today. Be happy with the progress while maintaining your drive to give your best to the day.Lastly as elon musk Quoted:Constantly think about how you could be doing things better and keep questioning Yourself. Hope this helps! Carpe Diem! Abhimanyu ",

            "answer_text": " Make life Simpler - Most problems are very straight-forward. Do not make them more complicated than they need to be. Instead ask yourself what is actually missing? What is the one thing you need to solve this problem? Everything else, while not irrelevant, makes your problem exponentially more complex.Example: If you need more money then find a second job, ask your boss what it would take to be promoted, or start doing some freelance work.Example: If you want to find love then go on more dating sites, go out more often and get to know more people.Only commit to what you will do - Especially to yourself you want to be honest. Either you do what you said you would do or you do not say it. When you do what you said you would you strengthen your belief in yourself and all following actions.Move faster - Do more. Move more. Have so much going on that you have to run everywhere you go. The reason you are bored or lead a lesser life is simply because you have too few things going on. Fill your schedule with amazing things where you can so that you do not get sucked into apathy and instead get excited.Example: Why do you think kids are so happy? The ones that are the most active not only sleep the best but also have the most fun.\u201cJust Do It\u201d - Your thoughts are the biggest things keeping you from a better life. In an attempt to find a better solution you often think yourself out of action and into inaction. Honestly though, you already know what to do\u2026 you just need to go and do it! Don\u2019t think. Act!Keep Learning - Be honest here: How many hours are you investing into your own learning or improvement? How many books have you read? How many courses have you paid for? How much have you invested in your own growth this last year, both financially and time wise? With the numbers, or even the lack of numbers in front of you, is it really that surprising that you are where you are?Chase Joy wherever you can - Life is not made amazing by getting rid of the stressful and the negative things. It is not by thinking about how to save what you have that you create a great life but by trying to create more of what makes life fun for you! Try to chase joy every day. Keep a list of things that make you smile, actively create plans to have fun, and set the intention to have a great time before you enter a situation.Become Personally Responsible for Everything - This is YOUR life. You are responsible for how you live it. So start acting more in line with your own interests instead of reacting to the choices made by others. Your life could be so much better if you took responsibility for where you are and how you felt and acted accordingly. It will not get better by denying what is happening.Let go of things that do not matter - What you did before is irrelevant now. You are not that person anymore and holding onto choices made by that person does nothing for you. Let go of the things that do not matter and focus on what does. Keep your mind clear of regret or worries of the future so you have more energy to spend right now!Learn to Smile - Not just smiling about things that bring you fun, but also about things that go wrong. Keep a sense of humor about everything that happens in your life, for your time is far too precious to waste it in fear. Besides, if you cannot change it there is no point to worrying, as it will remain the same whether you worry or not. And if you can change it, there is no point to worrying either, as it will change and not be what you worried about before. So smile, believe that you can figure it out and let it be what it is.",

            "answer_text": "I was having \u2018the talk\u2019 with my ex-boss, telling him stuff about my life, next job and aspirations. I was sobbing while telling him how everything is making me feel that I am useless. It was a conversation which had discussions, advices and a life-changing lesson. In the middle of the conversation, he said, Unnati, you are running behind small things, you do not value the big opportunities which will give you results in the future. And because you think about the present and not the future, you may regret the life that you are making. It did not make sense at that point in time. I thought that was just a way to demean an already broken soul but after a year of struggles, opportunities and learnings, his words make sense.  Here is a story: This is your life when you are born. An empty jar which you can fill with anything.  Now, you put golf balls inside the jar of life. These golf balls are the important things in your life. Like your parents, studies, career, good deeps, a few friends and some dreams.  Now, you put in the secondary things in life. Your car, job, house, phone and the social life that you portray on social media. These are like pebbles. Though your jar is full with golf balls, these pebbles still manage to get in your life and make it more comfortable.  Now, do you think the jar is full? No. You can still fill in some sand. This sand is like those memories which may hurt you, make you overthink, destroy your mental peace or the things that are not under your control.   What would have happened if the sand filled the jar first? There would be no space for the golf balls or the pebbles. This is what we do with our lives. We worry about things which are not under our control and overthink about the situations or people. We fill our jar with unimportant things and let go of the important things. But if we would act smart and put the golf balls first, trust me, we would live life to the fullest.  To live life to the fullest you ought to have a priority list. You have to decide what deserves your time and what does not. You have to be a bit selfish at times. Because you just have one jar! Think of the bigger picture.Give time to those you value.Do not lose your self-respect.Build a career.Help a stranger.Take care of your bodySleep well.Work really very hard,Help someone.Fail!And the foremost important thing, Have no regrets.Oh, by the way, at the end of the story they say, you can pour a little beer in the jar as well. That is to signify that you can have fun, always! And hey boss, if you are reading this, thank you so much for changing my life.  Picture Source: The Jar of Life: First things First ",

            "answer_text": "By Losing It All  I moved to another country by myself when I was a teenager. What was interesting was that while I knew this was going to be a big life event, I never fully understood at the time how profoundly it would change my understanding and appreciation of life. To begin, a bit of a background. I had a very well to do childhood. My parents were both doctors, I studied at one of the best international schools in Asia and overall my quality of life was very high. I had people to cook for me, clean for me, take care of me, etc. I had great friends and was close to my family. Anything I could ever think of was available to me. It was all fantastic\u2026 until the day I landed at O\u2019Hare Airport with three bags and big dreams. I moved to Chicago for college when I was 16. I was a few days short of my 17th birthday when I stepped out into the humid summer air and took in what was to be my new home for the near future. It all seemed fair and dandy until life hit me in the face a few hours later. I showed up to college after traveling 24+ hours to be told that there was no space in the dorms for me. Fantastic. So I walk around the neighborhood with my bags like a vagabond till I find a for rent sign on a tiny 450 sqft apartment (that was stupidly overpriced in retrospect) and I take it. Since I\u2019m technically a minor the can\u2019t rent it to me so I became very familiar with the legal system and how it worked that day. Tried opening a bank account shortly after, and same thing. I then go out shopping to find some furniture for my apartment. I realize I don\u2019t have a clue what to look for. I end up buying some decent furniture and losing a lot of money in the process. I\u2019d never setup a bed from scratch before so that learning came quick. Once all this toil is done, I sit down and see I\u2019m extremely hungry. I quickly realize outside of making ramen I have little to no experience in preparing food and don\u2019t have the money to go eat out. I went to bed hungry that night. The following day I realized I\u2019d never really done laundry before. Went through and started doing that and completely messed everything up and lost some clothes. Amazing. During all of this I wish I could\u2019ve just called over to my mom and asked her to come help me out. Unfortunately she\u2019s thousands of miles away and I\u2019m soon to be a grown man so I had to learn all this stuff for myself. Moreover, I\u2019m very close to my parents so I missed their company and being able to hang out with them. Without getting too verbose, I think you get the point. I had everything I could ever want and I never appreciated it. Then I had it all taken away from me and truly understood how much every little experience really meant. You can read some of my other answers to read more about my experience growing up in a foreign land. The cycle of events for me was very interesting. It started with being clueless, then frustration because I didn\u2019t get what I wanted, then acceptance of what I didn\u2019t have, then thankfulness for what little I did have and the journey to begin learning and growing what I wanted, and finally massive appreciation when I slowly started to get things back. I had to have it all taken away from me and slowly reintroduced back in my life for me to truly appreciate and \u201clive\u201d life. Whereas before I\u2019d bitch and cry about how something didn\u2019t taste just right, now I\u2019m thankful if I can just sit down and share a meal with someone I love. I\u2019ve learned that living life to the fullest means being dragged through the mud and coming out better for the wear. It\u2019s an appreciation for the beauty in all things, large and small, and that miracles happen everyday in each of our lives. Living life to the fullest is recognizing the power and magic of relationships with those we love, the blessings of good health and sound mind, and trying to make the world a better place for those that come after us. Sometimes the best things in life have to be taken away for one to realize how much they were truly worth to begin with. It\u2019s the combinations of these things, large and small, which is what makes life worth living. ",

(I know it\u2019s cliche\u2019.)Expect more from your life, and you\u2019ll certainly see great changes. Expect that life can be so full of joy and excitement, and all those beautiful colors and music, and all those amazing friendships and the playfulness that comes with them\u2026. It can be. Everything is possible. You just have to move out. You just have to expect, and start.Expand your horizons. Do new things, even if it means taking challenges. Do those things first, which you always wanted to do. Don\u2019t hesitate. Don\u2019t bother if you\u2019d be successful or not. Just DO. Make a start.Try to be BIGGER. Not in size, of course. :) Try to improve. Make your mind smarter, and determind towards achieving progress. \u2018Progress\u2019 is the key. If you start cooking food, make new highs. Try making new and challenging dishes. Try to add your own variations to the existing recipes.Understand, that life\u2019s not all about joys. You may have rough times once in a while. It\u2019s quite okay. What matters is: how you deal with your problems? You fight like a true fighter, and you have done a great job. Thumbs up. You lived your life to the fullest, even while in pain.Accept Simple Wisdoms. Be mature. Smile. Feel grateful for the life you are living. Try to make it better. Try to spread the joys around. Avoid confrontations. Be humble. But be spirited and enthusiastic.Make a sound routine. Don\u2019t live a wayward life. Don\u2019t fall into addictions. Live your life following a sound routine. Exercise daily, too. Also, if possible, spend some time with the nature.PEOPLE. And finally, don\u2019t forget people. The family and the friends, specially. Keep them close and share your joys and sorrows with them. Be with them.Cheers, Pranav  image source: Medium \u2013 Get smarter about what matters to you. ",

            "answer_text": " The secret to living life to the fullest is hiding in plain sight, but can\u2019t be grasped by thought. It\u2019s crazy how simple it is. It\u2019s also a secret that I wish I was aware of a long time ago. As human beings, we are constrained within time, which contains past, present, and future (or so we think). The truth is, there is no such thing as the past or the future - they are mental creations of the mind. This ultimately means time (in the psychological sense) is an illusion. There is only NOW. There is only THIS moment. Life is always happening through the now. Look at animals. Look at children. Look at nature in general. They are always rooted in NOW. Many people are not \u201chere\u201d, many people are stuck in their heads thinking about the past or anticipating the future. This means many people can\u2019t take effective action in the present, which is the only way you can live life.  A long time ago, I used to look towards the future as salvation from my unsatisfactory life. When I get jacked, then I\u2019ll be happy. When I get out college, I\u2019ll have a better life. When I get to X age, everything will make sense. When I become good at guitar, then I\u2019ll feel accomplished. When I make a certain amount of money, then all of my worries will disappear. All of these things happened, but guess what? There was still this gnawing sense of unease. Then, more future projection started to happen. I realized what I was doing: mortgaging my happiness in the present for some future that may or may not happen. I was so dissatisfied with what was going on NOW that I needed an escape. Why couldn\u2019t I be content looking out the window on a nice day? Why couldn\u2019t I accept my feelings instead of trying to bury them? Why couldn\u2019t I just be fine with whatever happened?  If you want to live life to the fullest, accept and embrace NOW. Realize that you must take action and don\u2019t put things off to some imaginary \u201csome day\u201d. Some day will become right now, eventually. If you\u2019re in a bad situation, just accept it. Feel the entirety of your situation. Don\u2019t run from it, don\u2019t hide from it. Realize that the situation will change, just like the weather does. You might be depressed. Embrace your sadness. You might be heartbroken. Embrace your anguish. You might be out of a job. Embrace your unemployment. Accept all these things as the tide of your life. The present moment is a doorway. It is a gift. It is an opportunity to become \u201cone with life\u201d and make things happen. But if you don\u2019t see that opportunity, if you don\u2019t get out of your own way, you will never live a great life. You will always be projecting the past onto the current moment, which creates your future. That means your life will be one, long, monotonous string of repetition and nonfulfillment. Be aware and awake to what is. If you do that, the rest will take care of itself. ",

            "answer_text": "To me, it seems that the way in which we can live our lives to the fullest comes about as a result of mastering the abstract dualities of reality. Life is filled with a complex amalgam of contradictory dualities. The key to a full life is to strike the right balance between hundreds of these pairs of abstractions. The only problem is that the \u201cright\u201d balance varies depending on the environment, the society, and not to mention the individual. Let me go over one of the most common human dualities and what I think the right balance could ideally look like for it. Repetition vs. Experimentation In any endeavor, we need repetition to practice the skills that go with what we\u2019re doing. Without redundancy, we can never develop mastery. For example, a basketball player who wants to improve their shooting percentage would naturally want to practice by taking several hundreds of shots per day. However, repetition is often not enough. We also need experimentation to find new methods and techniques for achieving our aims which we never thought of before. I am going back to the example of the basketball player. Maybe he is shooting thousands and shots per day and seeing little improvements. However, if he adjusted his shooting form and the timing of his jump, he could completely change his shot and see massive improvements. To do that, he must experiment and be willing to venture into uncharted territory. Changing the way you\u2019ve shot the ball for years is awkward and missing many more shots than you\u2019re used to will feel embarrassing. The master once again becomes the fool to propel himself to a higher plane. This is what people mean by working smart vs. working hard. One path is repetition, and one is strategic experimentation. One builds you up, the other tears you down so you can begin anew and build yourself up into something better. But then, some people are overly experimental and don\u2019t put enough repetition into their activities. If we try to do everything and be everyone, we end up accomplishing nothing and becoming nobody. That\u2019s why striking a balance between repetition and experimentation is so important for finding fulfillment in your aims. But this duality doesn\u2019t just apply to your work life or hobby. It applies to every single aspect of life. For example, to maintain a romantic relationship, you have to do a lot of repetitive things for the other person that keep things together. Cheering them up after a bad day at work. Going to the grocery store to purchase supplies together. Making them coffee or sending them loving text messages. Repetition and order are necessary to keep the relationship stable and supportive. However, experimentation is also necessary. Without testing and controlled chaos, the relationship will quickly grow stale and collapse in on itself. Going out together to a new event in town. Challenging each other to grow on a personal level. Making significant life changes together, such as having children or moving to a new city. These are the activities that open the doors to the unknown and allow for exploration in hopes of finding something better. Without experimentation, one or both partners will seek something new in the form of another person to be with. However, too much experimentation and instability will destroy the relationship just the same. That\u2019s what it means to have three arguments a day for a month. It seems to me that the right balance between repetition and experimentation is something like 80/20. 80% of our actions should be repetitive, maintaining order and building mastery. The remaining 20% of our actions should be experimental, somewhat chaotic, and on the quest for novel experiences. Too much repetition leads to a stale life that will feel like more of a grind than anything else. Forty years later and you\u2019re filled with regrets about things you didn\u2019t get to experience. But it\u2019s too late because you\u2019re old and weak, and your life is nearly finished. On the other hand, too much experimentation and experience-seeking in life will lead to a fragmented identity. Twenty years later and you still don\u2019t know who you are, what you do, or what your place is in the world. That\u2019s a scary place to be, primarily as an older adult. Balance. I suspect that it\u2019s not 50/50 for most people. But, find the right balance for you. \u2014Karim ",

            "answer_text": "For me the most important thing in life is to be true to myself. This effectively makes me free, free from trying to please others, free from regret, i make my bed and i lie on it..good or bad, better to die, after living a harsh life knowing that you lived the life you chose. than to die in a semi detached house, well heated, with a few savings, knowing that you never tried the things you wanted to . honesty to oneself is the most important thing in life, even though sometimes this may lead to living a life that is not fun. Emily Pankhurst was true to herself, she was a sufragette, Ghandi was a trained solicitor but gave it all up for a meagre existence. Steve Wozniac walked out of a top job at Hewlet Packard, to risk it all building apple computers. Bill Gates walked out of Harvard to pursue microsoft, i am sure there have been many who did the same but ended up failing, but at least they did what they felt was true to themselves. Basically by being true to yourself regardless of social conditioning, you will find happiness in the journey of life, eg..if you had a great job, but didnt really like the company you were working for and you wanted to do something else\u2026 start pursuing that something else and quit your job, you may be short of money, but what about the excitement you feel and the journey of your new career, the total motivation and stimulation, the unknown. These things are what make your life rich. LIving on your instincts. During the second world war, people used to hear the air raid sirens and had to run to cold air raid shelters, where evryone was in a state of anxitey, and not many facilities for the night. When they left the shelters, they sometiems encountered demolished buildings and dead bodies. They struggled and helped each other and made it through the war. When they look back from their semi detached houses with garages. THey look back at the war years as being the best years of their lives, where they had nothing, but comradery and witts. Im not telling you to go to war\u2026i m saying that living by your witts, by taking risks is exciting and as near as you or i will probably get to having a fulfiling life. alternatively you could roll over and settle for the norm\u2026.but remember you only live once.

            "answer_text": "1. Surround yourself with awesome, positive people. Terminate negative and toxic relationships right now. You cannot live life to the fullest if people around you suck your energy or ruin your vibe. Undisputed fact.This will increase your potential for a life \"full\" of happy relationships and environments. 2. Write down 5 fun things you would like to say you did within the next five years. (ex. visit France, start a company, learn Spanish, run a marathon). Put 'em on a Post-it in a place you see every day. Don't worry about planning anything yet -- just seeing them daily will make you take action when you're ready.This will increase your potential for a life \"full\" of happy experiences. 3. As you brush your teeth every night before bed, think of ONE single thing you're grateful for. If you had a crappy day, be grateful you have access to internet / have a toothbrush / that Nutella exists / whatever. When you practice gratefulness, even when forced, you train your perception to never settle for anything less than a silver lining. Start this today.Mastering the art of being grateful will increase your potential for a life \"full\" of positive attitudes. 4. Write down ONE thing in your life that is unhealthy right now and that you can have control over (nutrition, hydration, smoking, weight, excessive caffeine, exercise, etc). Work on changing that ONE thing. Start now (do 5 push-ups, throw away some candy, etc). Improving your health as much as you can increases your potential for a life \"full\" of movement, reach, confidence and chemical happiness. 5. Understand that your only personal goal in life is happiness.  In other words, The ultimate personal goal in life is a feeling. Always and for everyone. \"I wish a had a successful company\" --> No. You wish you had the happy and proud feelings you think you will get from owning a company.  \"I wish I had a better relationship with my father/mother/brother\". --> you wish you could feel the happiness & love that those good relationships can bring you. Fast cars, money, family, saving the world, friends, love, travel, a hot spouse, cat videos, etc are not Goals. Instead, these are extremely important and life-altering Tools that we can use to bring us closer to our one and only goal: happiness.The reason that it's important to understand the difference between tools and a goal, is that your internal needs have a tendency to change.And our inability to readjust to our changing internal needs can cause a disassociation between our routine, active goals and our path to fulfillment. So, every 6 months ask yourself: \"Why do I do what I do?\".Are you happy with your answer? Why or why not? This question will guide you towards continuance or change. This will increase your potential for a life \"full\" of agility and right choices.   TL;DR, these are the things you can do now, in 5 minutes, to being a living life to the fullest:  Say bye-bye to negative and toxic people.Write down 5 awesome things you would like to do in the next 5 years. Only 5. Put them somewhere visible.Say thank you for ONE thing every day. Say it out loud/ think it / write it / doodle it, doesn\u2019t matter. Just do it.  Today is day one.Write down ONE way you can improve your health. Only ONE. Keep thinking about it for the coming days. Eventually you will come up with a plan.Ask yourself \u201cWhy do I do what I do?\u201d",

            "answer_text": "Last year when I was traveling by the train to Hyderabad .I met a guy. His name was Anav. He taught the biggest lesson of my life. He changed the way I see my life and changed my perspective towards life . He taught me how to live the life to it's fullest. He was wearing normal clothes just like me . He was around 27 years old. I was feeling thirsty but I found my water bottle empty. This guy was sitting beside me was drinking water from his water . So I asked him to give the bottle to me so that I can drink water . And after that our conversation started. Firstly I told everything about me . He told me that he is a successful business person having many businesses. So I asked him that why he is traveling train instead of plane, if he is so successful. He explained me the way he see the life. He told me that rather than spending money on the things and materialistic items, he spends money on experiences and for happiness. He told me that though he has so many successful businesses but he is not very rich .I was really confused at that time and also curious. In that curiosity I asked him suddenly if you are successful business man than why are you not rich ? He told me that because he uses his money somewhere else. I asked him immidiately , where did you use your money ? He explained me that he is spending money on his dream. He told me from the beginning. From his childhood only it was his dream to do something for the society , to make it a better place , to help others in any way he can. The biggest dream which he had was to open schools around the country in which he could provide free education to the kids of rural areas. Not only just provide funding for those schools but also to become a teacher in the schools and teach students and live like a kid and to become a friend of those kids and help them to fulfill their dreams. It was his dream. From the very beginning of his life he knew what he wanted to do and what was the purpose of his life so he kept working hard towards that dream. As of now he started around 20 schools and more than 10k students are being benefited from his schools . He also spends some time among the kids of his school. He used to teach the life lessons which are necessary for the kids to learn and which no text books can teach them. His schools focuses more on the practical knowledge and his main motive is to make student a good person rather than a successful person. His schools focus more on the moral values to make students a better person. Not only this he has also started a combination of old age home and orphanage. His vision for starting is that the orphan will get the love of the parents and old people out there in the home. And those old people will get the care and love from the kids whom do not have anyone in life. Thus he explained me the way he lives his life. He is living his life to it's fullest and also he is living his dreams. He is not only helping others but also making a lots of people happy including himself. He also explained me the way to be happy. He told me that if you want to be happy in life then always help others . It is not necessary to do something big but even small helps to the needy will make the difference . And living the life this way is the only way to live the life to it's fullest. Keeping others happy is the only way to keep yourself happy . Even a single smile of yours will work , not huge efforts are required !!! That guy that day changed the way I see the life !!! ",

            "answer_text": "Smile! When you smile you feel better immediately! Try it this very moment and you will realize that the simple act of physically smiling automatically triggers off a sense of relax and wellbeing. Amazing, right? Secondly when you smile you get smiled back at, likewise if you frown, so it's kind of obvious that it\u2019s better to get smiled at than frowned at, so\u2026continue smiling!Every night just before you fall asleep, say to yourself, with profound conviction and belief, \"I am happy, I have a good life, and tomorrow when I get up I will feel great!\" This works unbelievably well. It's like when every day I say, \"I'm very well Thank You\", every time people ask me how I am. At the end of the day I've said it so often, I've convinced myself. This is probably the most important secret of being happy...You just have to believe you are, and you will be!Spend your money and your time in experiences instead of things! I hardly remember all the things I have had or been given, and most are trashed, forgotten, obsolete, lost, broken or sold off in a garage sale. On another hand I still treasure every and all my life experiences, and they are all saved in my mind forever. I still remember the road trips with my family when I was but a child, or camping out in the yard, or some very good days in the beach, or the very first time I went fishing with my dad, and many. many more. These experiences all are part of who I am, how I relate to the world around me, and define the person whom people see and recognize. So why not carry those experiences that will be with you forever instead of physical stuff that will just degrade and decay?Understand that happiness comes from within, not from without and that it's more of a decision than happenstance or luck, so decide to be happy and you will most certainly be so.Finally live your life as fully as you can, pursue your dreams with passion, fill your life with things you like and like to do, try and enjoy everything you do, even if you don't like them (if it's really that bad, let go and do something different, at the end of the day it's your life, and why should you suffer things you really don't need!). Us humans are never happier than when we are on the move and our life is filled with activities and things to do. It is only when we stumble, stop and start vegetating, that we start questioning ourselves, our life and our existence! So get moving and feel the fullness of your life filling your soul, and sooner than you know, you will come to realize you are happy!",

            "answer_text": "You cannot, if you have to ask that question. Because Life is full right now. What is blocking you from seeing that is:a) Your own ideas of how a \u2018full life is supposed to look like\u2019! b) Refusal to believe that what you seek is something you already have. Look at this disappointed tourist. His travel agent promised him a \u2018rose garden\u2019 but took him to a flower paradise instead. The tourist cannot enjoy the paradise. Because that is not what he is looking for.  \u201cBut your tourist itinerary said it would be a \u2018bed of roses\u2019. I do not see roses.\u201d Of course if you point that out to him, he will say its not about the flowers but about \u2018commitment\u2019, \u2018business ethics \u2018, \u2018principles\u2019 and so on. But can he see that his own good beliefs are coming in the way of his own goal : enjoy the present moment of his tour to the fullest.  This is how our typical definitions look like:What is the least you need to be happy? Stable job, spouse, kids, a car, house OR Well paying job, beautiful spouse, no kids, a car, house with high-speed internet. What is the best you need to be happy?My own billion dollar business like Facebook, fame for some art skill(singing, playing music, photography etc\u2026to earn the badge of a \u2018multi talented personality\u2019) spouse, bigger car, bigger house. OR My own billion dollar business like Facebook, no spouse, chartered plane, houses on multiple islands. And of course high-speed internet. The permutation/combinations might vary but an entire human\u2019s life is being defined by 4 things! a) Means of earning, b) place of stay, c) family members and d) people\u2019s opinions? This is just an illustrative example. The takeaway is that often we have very rigid ideas of what will make us happy. The question is: What if you get something different? Something better? Would you be able to appreciate it? What if you get sweet, spring water and you are waiting around with a ruler to measure the \u2018good things in life\u2019? But that is assuming you HAVE something worth appreciating right? Right. So let\u2019s look at something to be sad about. Tragedy #1: Have good education but don\u2019t have a job? Well, until you get one - you can help a poor child with her homework. That can change her life. You have the potential to change someone\u2019s life!!! Right now. But no!!! Cos that does not fit within your definition of \u2018full life\u2019 Tragedy #2: Have a job but not paying enough? Not getting the house you wanted? The vacation you wanted? Your friends\u2019 FB status updates making you feel like a loser? You can pay the fees for a poor child\u2019s year\u2019s education. It might change his life!You can call up that lonely old relative. Spend 10 minutes talking. It could leave them with memories of a life time!You can simply cuddle with your spouse or take a 30 minute walk down the street without going to the mall and worrying about all the things you cannot buy! It can add to your life\u2019s memories.Tragedy #3: Got only 6 months to live?Come on! Nothing can be worse than this, right? But exactly! Nothing can be worse anyway! What the hell will you do with all those savings? How does it matter who complains what you left for them or didn\u2019t. Take a world trip, take a country trip, take a state trip. Do stuff that does not harm anybody but you thought were \u2018morally not OK\u2019. People might still write articles about how you \u2018Made the best out of life\u2019. They can DO it too. Right now. But they don\u2019t do it. Instead, they choose to think about it.  You have the power to change lives, others\u2019 and your own - right now. You have the power to be deeply happy - right now. You have ways to make the best out of life - right now. But those ways do not fit into your ideas of a full life. You are busy looking for something harder, bigger and longer. Which is \u2018out there\u2019 Refusing to consider it might be simpler, smaller and faster. And \u2018right here\u2019 A full life is not something you achieve at the end of a hollow, painful journey. A full life is simply a series of moments lived to the fullest.  ",

            "answer_text": "Life becomes more deeply rewarding and fulfilling as we transform, through experience, our mere knowledge of ourselves and the world into wisdom. This inherently requires time and thus wisdom is generally acquired later in life. This is not immediately obvious to younger people because this world seems to belong to the young. The world cherishes and admires youth and youthful beauty so much that we quickly and mindlessly dismiss the unique and profound gifts of age which hold the keys to wisdom and meaning. When we are young our inexperience leads us to believe we are living life in its entirety. What we see, understand, and know seems not only to be where it's all at, constituting the only things of value, but that if we are not in the center of it all, if we are not young, cutting edge and sexy, we are unimportant, redundant, and seen as having no useful contribution. It takes time and experience to understand that we all start out with only one lens through which we view ourselves and the world. Our socialization, education and acculturation lead only to the world view that fits the current paradigm in which we exist. Only experience enables the paradigm shifts to occur that are necessary for us to see the world from more than one angle and through more than one lens. Probably the most important factor in achieving a fulfilling life is knowing who we truly are, knowing our own truth and desire. Our truth is the essence of who we are, what we want to do and be in life, regardless of what we have been raised to believe about ourselves, and despite what others (especially those we give our power to, those we admire and look to as role models) are saying and doing around us.  The only way we can learn who we truly are is through deep and varied life experiences. Just as when we choose a particular color of paint for our walls we need to see it in all different times of day and in various intensities of light, because it is astonishing how different one shade can be in different conditions.  When I was younger I always assumed that if I ever witnessed an accident or trauma I would always avail myself to help anyone in need. Then in my late 20s I was living in London and, walking one morning down Fleet Street to work, I caught sight of something above me. I looked up to see a body falling from several floors above. Acting on pure instinct alone, I turned away because, somewhere deep inside of me, I knew I could not witness the landing of the body on the pavement. I turned around and I never looked back. I did not stay to help. I did not hesitate in my desire and intention to escape. To this day I have no idea why I reacted this way, but this experience showed me how I actually do behave in such circumstances and it is now part of my self knowledge.  Some of our most instructive experiences occur in the times when we think no one is watching us, when we face temptation, when we have the opportunity for revenge, when we realize we have power over someone, or when we feel we don't have what we need and we feel very much like we may not survive. We have to go through many, many versions of these experiences till we get to the point where we choose thoughts, words and actions that conform to the version of ourselves that we aspire to be. Every experience has something new to show us about ourselves, who we are in every degree of light and shade, even those that seem repetitive and identical to previous experiences. This is because depth and intensity often require repetition. So when we feel we are drifting through life, that nothing we do is of any real value, it can be useful to remember that we are in the process of creating the ultimate work of art: our true selves. Then there are the traumatically disrupting experiences, that almost all of us have to endure at some point, where we experience deep loss (of a loved one, a job, a marriage, health or money) that shows us that so much of what we always believed to be true is, in fact, not. It is crucial to understand that our ability to find peace, love, happiness, and success - all the aspects of what we usually consider to be a \"fulfilling\" life - is directly related to our ability to accept the vast array of life's vicissitudes, no matter how disturbing or distressing they may be, because these loss experiences become the new and improved lens which ultimately provides sharper and more accurate views of life and love that eventually lead to meaning and wisdom. In addition to learning who we are, we must also learn what is our true desire. This is not as easy as it might seem. What we want to be and do has to be unpacked from all the social conditioning, beliefs and pressures that formed the first few versions of ourselves. This is usually a gradual process, a series of experiments where we test all the possible options until we have enough knowledge and experience to know what makes our heart and soul sing. ( I can safely say that for me, that does not include listening to hard rock, eating mass produced meat, or feeling obliged to read, and admire, the literary canon). And it is for this reason that whilst most over 50 would love to inhabit their 25 year old body again (most likely seeing that body with far greater love and acceptance than we did the first time round) almost none would want the young and inexperienced, often confused and insecure, 25 year old mind that goes with it.  When we have sufficient experience to accumulate great knowledge about ourselves, other people and the world, we are ready to develop a new set of skills: the subtle art of alchemy and transmutation. Knowledge is transformed into wisdom, and wisdom gives us the tools to embed our lives in love and truth. Life and experience teach us that love and truth, and the enlightenment and meaning they lead to, are the only things of any true and lasting value. ",

If your answer to any of the above is a no, maybe or not sure, that means you\u2019re not living your life to the fullest.

Some of these ideas you\u2019ll be able to put into practice right away, some of these might plant the seed for ideas you\u2019ll put into practice for the future.

            "answer_text": "Work on your mental health. Your mind is as important as the rest of your body, and it's important that you practice good mental health. This includes meeting your emotional needs. Feeling emotionally well can help you see positive changes in the rest of your life. You can improve your mental health by surrounding yourself with people that you trust and making sure that you are comfortable in your surroundings. If you are experiencing unpleasant emotions, such as sadness or loneliness, it is possible that seeing a mental health professional would be useful. Find a reputable counselor in your area.Try planning something fun to do at least once a week. This could be as simple as arranging a standing coffee date with a good friend. Having something to look forward to can really help you feel more mentally balanced.Learn to handle stress. Stress is one of the biggest problems people face when trying to improve their mental health. Try finding coping mechanisms to use when you are in a difficult situation, such as taking deep breaths or counting to ten. Get organized. Keeping a to-do list or calendar can be a great way to manage your hectic life. Try this method to ease the stress of your busy life.Get physically fit. Taking care of your body is crucial for overall health. People who are more physically fit are generally happier and have lower rates of stress. Take good care of yourself by eating a heathy diet and getting regular exercise. Get moving. Joining a gym is a great way to get healthy and interact with other people. Look for one in your neighborhood. Walking is also a great way to get some physical activity each day. Physical exercise can also provide you with a much needed break from work.Eat lots of fruits and veggies. People who eat a balanced diet are less likely to suffer from health problems, such as high cholesterol or diabetes.Be spiritually healthy. Spiritual wellness means being in tune with your beliefs and values. In order to get in touch with your spiritual side, try to think about what is most important to you, and focus on those things. You can also consider what you believe is your purpose in life. Being spiritual means being mindful. Try using methods such as mediation or yoga to increase your spiritual well being.Enhance your interpersonal relationships. Your interactions with other people can have a big impact on your well being. Involving yourself in positive relationships can make you feel happier and less stressed. If you have negative people in your life, it can cause you to feel unhappy and unhealthy. If you are in a romantic relationship, make it a priority to improve it. Try spending more quality time with your partner and being more physically affectionate.Improve other relationships. Your relationships at work are also important to your well being. Try to find common interests with your coworkers to enhance your bond. You can also try volunteering to help them if you notice they are swamped. Focus on your friends and family. Your closest relationships are often with your pals and your relatives. Make sure to schedule time to spend with them.Increase your intellectual health. You need to strengthen your mind the same way you strengthen your other muscles. Being intellectually healthy means that you challenge and engage your brain. You are curious and like to explore new places and things.  Travel to new places. This is one of the best ways to learn new things and stimulate your mind.Do puzzles. There are many things you can do at home to stretch your brain. Try crossword puzzles, Sudoku, or challenging board games. Start fresh each day. If things aren't going your way, try to take some of the pressure off of yourself. Look at each day as a new beginning. This mindset will help you be able to see the positives in life. Try journaling before bed each night. Writing down your thoughts can help you sleep better and start each day with a clear mind.Be proactive. In order for your life to change, you need to be the force that drives changes. Being proactive means that you are in charge of your own destiny. You respond to your own choices, not choices made by other people. When you feel in charge of your own life, you will start to feel more comfortable and confident. To be proactive, think about specific actions that you can take to improve your life, and then take them. For example, if you are unhappy with your job, a proactive step to change that would be to update your resume and start applying for new jobs.Form new habits. If there are parts of your life that you feel are not the best they could be, try to make changes. Maybe you want to improve your physical fitness or maybe you want to save more money. Whatever it is, try making changes in your daily life in order to see big changes. For example, try setting aside $2 a day as a way to start saving more money. A habit typically takes two months to really become part of your routine, so be patient with yourself.Set Goals. Goals are a reflection of your priorities and are concrete ways that you can improve your life. Goal setting can be useful in every area of your life. Having realistic goals can help you visualize the changes you want to see happen. Set both long-term and short-term goals. When you see results from the short-term goals, that will give you the encouragement you need to persevere and make long term changes.Find your Passions. Having a purpose in your life can help you to live the best life possible. Try asking yourself what you would do if you no longer had to worry about money. When you find the answer, you're on your way to find your passion. Follow your curiosity. Your passion is unique to you, but it will definitely be something your find both interesting and challenging. For example, if you love animals, find a way to work with them. You could begin by volunteering at your local shelter. Appreciate something each day. Try to put some effort into truly taking pleasure out of your life. One simple way to do this is to choose something to take pleasure in every day. This can be as simple as taking a moment to taste and savor your morning coffee. Or you could make it a habit to spend thirty minutes each day doing something that you truly enjoy. Avoid Comaparations. Try not to measure your life against someone else's. For example, if you are concerned about your finances, try to think of ways to increase your income. This is an action you can take to improve your situation as opposed to thinking about your friend who has a higher paying job and wondering why you can't make that kind of money. When you compare yourself to someone else, you often end up judging yourself unfavorably. Most people compare themselves with those we perceive as having more or being \"better.\" They also tend to compare themselves to an idealized version of that person, ignoring the fact that the other person is human, with flaws and challenges like everyone else. Instead of measuring yourself against others, compare your past and present selves. How have you grown in the last year? What can you do today that you couldn't do before?Comparing yourself to another person is like comparing apples to oranges. It is an inaccurate and irrelevant measurement, since everyone is unique. It's as illogical as comparing your swimming ability to a dolphin's.Go outside. Research tells us that fresh air can have a positive impact on your health, both mental and physical. Try to take some time each day (or week) to spend some time outdoors. You can visit your neighborhood park, or go on a weekend adventure to a nearby state park. Practice self-acceptance. Focus on your positive traits. If you are overly critical of yourself, it can be hard to find pleasure in your life. Instead, take some time each day to focus on your strengths. Make it a habit to compliment yourself. Try taping a sticky note to your bathroom mirror that reminds you that you are a great person.Be playful. Embracing your inner child can help you feel like you are living life to the fullest. Try doing something silly, like skipping or turning a cartwheel. Don't be afraid to laugh. You can also make it a habit to joke around with your your friends and family. Your playfulness will likely rub of on them. source: How to Live the Best Life You Can ",

            "answer_text": " Living life to the fullest every day should not be a challenger but more like a reward. Let me explain. Sometime in the past, I realized that doing special things everyday and getting them done helped me feel accomplished. But that didn\u2019t actually help me feel like I was living my life to the fullest. I wondered. How come I\u2019m getting all these stuff done and not feeling any better or happier? I found out that it is not the amount of things that I accumulate in my life, but how much Happiness I get from it. This could be what it means from the saying, \u201cMoney can\u2019t buy happiness\u201d and \u201cDo the things that you love, not the things that has the highest pay\u201d. Find things where you, just yourself, can sit and do it for hours everyday without feeling regret and happy. That is exactly what it means to find something you love doing. I personally love to play drums. I can put on headphones on and play to my favorite music and go on for hours jamming like there is no tomorrow. I get lost in it but I find so much happiness in it. Even if I play a little bit, it gives me a brighter side to look at in life. Drumming may not be one of the most happiest things that you can do or probably most people. However, the key point is to find something that makes you Happy. Whether that is playing a musical instrument, working out in the gym to transform your body in to a beautiful figure, eating tasty foods, traveling and all those other good stuff. Find what you Really Love, then will you find your true happiness~  My philosophy professor once told me. Happiness is key. Happiness is the chief good. The reason why we do everything else. We think making a million dollars is the end goal? No. Money, literally is just a piece of paper (or plastic in my country, Canada lol). We use money to buy the stuff in order to feel, happy.  Money, the biggest house, six pack abs is not the end goal. Happiness is. Finding something that makes truly happiness is that way to live your life to the fullest. :) ",
