            "answer_text": "Venus and Earth are similar in size and composition, sure, but its active volcanoes and greenhouse effect turns it into a living hell. The temperatures over there are so high that they are hot enough to melt lead.  Radar images from Magellan show that the Venusian surface has an abundance of mountains, craters, thousands of volcanoes and some of them are much larger than Earth's and definitely active. There are some flat areas too though, and you would think that's where we would set up a home base to live. The thing is that walking there wouldn't be a very pleasant experience, in fact the planet suffers from a greenhouse gas effect, meaning its thick atmosphere is full of heat-trapping carbon dioxide which keeps the temperatures at 870 degrees F or 465 degrees C.  If you were to stand on its surface, you would experirnce air about 90 times heavier than Earth's atmosphere. The air is so thick that if you tried to move your arm quickly, you would feel resistance, it would be like diving 3000 feet beneath the ocean.High in its atmosphere winds can travel up to 249 mph (400 km/h), meaning way faster than tornado and hurricane winds on Earth.  We did send quite a few landers up there and surprisngly enough, Venera 7 and Venera 8 succeeded in transmitting data once they reached the surface, but these were brief missions and they did not survive more than one hour in those extreme conditions.So, due to all of these extreme conditions, if humans were ever to live on Venus, it would almost certainly be in the clouds, high above its surface. The thought is to have permanent floating cities on Venus! Apparently at cloud-top level, Venus is the paradise planet. A. Landis of NASA's Glenn Research Center proposed aerostat habitats followed by floating cities, based on the concept that breathable air is a lifting gas in the dense carbon dioxide atmosphere, with over 60% of the lifting power that helium has on Earth. In fact, a baloon full of human breathable air would sustain itself and extra weight (such as a colony) in mid air. At an altitude of 50 km above the Venusian surface, the temperatures and pressure would be ideal. The temperatures would range between 0 to 50 degrees C. The atmosphere above would protect us from cosmic radiation, shielding us pretty much just like here on Earth. It is thought that humans would not even require pressurized suits when outside, they would merely need air to breathe, protection from the acidic rain and in some occasions protection against heat. There are some remaining issues though, such as water, as it would be very hard to retrieve it from the surface and way too expensive to bring it from Earth or the asteroids. I find the concept very intriguing though. ",

            "answer_text": "Venus is a nightmarish hellscape. The atmospheric pressure is roughly nine million pascals, 90 times that found on Earth. Standing on the surface of Venus would feel like being 3000 feet under the ocean. Surface temperatures are high enough to melt lead. The atmosphere is toxic, composed of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide, and minute amounts of argon and water vapor. The sulfur dioxide precipitates as acid rain. The rain evaporates before it reaches the surface, but it is basically like taking a shower in battery acid. How could we ever hope to make this planet habitable for humans? To start with, hydrogen. Lots and lots and lots and lots of hydrogen. Bombarding the planet with literal tons of elemental hydrogen would help break up the atmosphere. This would combine with the various oxides in the atmosphere to create elemental oxygen, water (which would likely stay in its gaseous form) and carbon. With the nitrogen already present, we could likely have an Earth-like atmosphere after several centuries. Maybe a few milennia. We would likely have to install solar shades to further cool the planet. With an Earth-like atmosphere, Venus would probably still be too hot for unprotected exposure. Venus is just outside the inner edge of the Sun\u2019s circumsteller habitable zone, sometimes known as the Goldilocks zone. Even if we could remove the crushing atmosphere and replace it with one more friendly to humanity, it would likely still be too hot for liquid surface water to exist without further cooling the planet. That isn\u2019t our only issue however. Because Venys is significantly closer to the sun, it experiences a higher degree of tidal locking. A day on Venus lasts about ten Earth months, and about twenty days longer than a Venusian year. Changing the atmospheric chemistry would be child\u2019s play compared to increasing the planets rotational speed. Some have proposed using millions of comets mined from the Kuiper belt to fly near the planet, gently increasing its rotational speed a little bit each time. Of course, this involves moving trillions of tons of rock billions of kilometers. Increasing the rotational speed is virtually impossible. It is unknown if the planet would still be habitable with such a long day. The day side would be a scorched desert, with a massive, continent-sized hurricane at the equator directly below the sun. The night side would be a frozen wasteland, cold enough to condense any remaining CO2 into dry ice. The terminator line where night turns to day would be weackec by horrific windstorms as the two extreme temperatures met. Any colony would have to be either mobile or deep underground. Terraforming Venus is theoretically possible, but it would take 1 thousands of years and require us to harvest a significant portion of the sun\u2019s energy. Who knows where technology will be 100 years from now, never mind 1000, but I don\u2019t see Cenus being terraformed any time soon. There have been other options discussed, however. In the upper levels of the Venusian atmosphere, atmospheric pressure and temperatures are similar to those found on Earth. If we could create a stable floating colony (imagine Cloud City from Star Wars but much, much smaller), we could theoretically walk around with only an oxygen supply. Unless it was raining. And then your skin would melt off your bones. Mars presents its own host of problems, but it would be much, much, much, MUCH easier to terraform Mars than Venus. ",

            "answer_text": "Terraforming Venus would require an intensive effort for a great expanse of time. It has 90 bars of CO2 and sulphuric acid to quench in carbonate and sulphate rocks, and significantly less water than Earth. It receives nearby the double of solar heat. So that a prerequisite to any terraformation attempt is either to buld it a shade, or to change its orbit. Changing the orbit of a major planet seems far fetched, and it will indeed need time. But this is still possible, and I describe how in my chapter on terraforming the planets. Added: Venus has more nitrogen and less water than Earth. This would reduce the oceans to some separated basins, and rainy enough weather to their surroundings. The highest mountains would be cold, just as on Earth. but people being accustomed to Earth air pressure could live higher. Many places would be cool to cold deserts interspeced with cracks or dunes. The general landscape would look just as on Earth. But mountains are more massive, not being cut by a lot of rivers and glaciers. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, although Venus will take longer to terraform the Mars, but will in some way be easier, because most of the elements are there. Water and oxygen just need to be released form complicated compounds. If your worried about life ending meteors hitting the Earth, Venus makes more sense; Mars get pummeled by meteors way more frequently then Earth. It's closer to where the asteroids are waiting. Once terraformed, Venus will be safer then either Mars or Earth concerning meteor bombardments. ",
