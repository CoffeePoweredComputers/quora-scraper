            "answer_text": "A2A, it really depends on your future choice of career. When I was in 12th I pursued a language course and a programming course, which both proved to be in vain. So I suggest you to choose a course which you are really obsessed for, you can go for customisation training workshop, if you are interested in Automobile, you can attend programming or app development workshop if you want CS and same for every stream. It really depends on your choice of course. PS: If you want to pursue acting or direction, then just watch good IMDb - Movies, TV and Celebrities films at home. :P  Hope it helped!! ",
