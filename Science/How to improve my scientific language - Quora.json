            "answer_text": "Scientific language alone is not important. You also need to understand the ideas/principles behind the terms e.g. the word \u2018boiling\u2019 when used by a scientist, does not mean merely very hot. To a scientist it describes a liquid at a temperature where it will begin to change to a gaseous form. Evolution in science is a concept/theory that describes change of a particular sort. By donning new clothes or changing your physical appearance in some other way, does not constitute evolution as understood by scientists. Evolution is said to have occurred when the allele frequency in a population changes over a period of time. Just using scientific vocabulary without understanding may give the illusion of being learned but what you say using that vocabulary will be the better test of your scientific knowledge and understanding.

            "answer_text": "To improve one\u2019s vocabulary in anything, it\u2019s best to just dive into it. Study. Experiment. Write. Read more. Find classmates and talk about it. Take classes. In high school, my dad insisted that all my electives (except for choir) were science oriented. I did take a history elective only because I had pretty much gone through the science classes. In college, I had science and math classes all the way through. This has helped me professionally, too. I can talk with engineers, researchers, lab technicians and customers. If you want to improve your vocabulary, you also need to use it and ask a lot of questions. ",
