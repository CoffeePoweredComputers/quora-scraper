            "answer_text": "The Science of Snowflakes, and Why No Two Are Alike  Credit: The American Chemical Society  Peer through a magnifying glass at a snowflake, and you\u2019ll see an ice creation more elaborate than anything Martha Stewart could cut from folded paper. So what\u2019s behind the snowflake\u2019s unique and elaborate shape? The snowflakes that settle upon our sleeves and scarves during a snowstorm have more variations in shape than you might think. There\u2019s the classic snowflake: a flat plate with branchlike, dendritic arms. Some look like hexagonal prisms; others like hollow pencil-shaped columns or tiny needles. We tracked down two ice experts to help answer the question: Kenneth Libbrecht, a physics professor at the California Institute of Technology and avid snowflake photographer, and John Hallett, director of the Ice Physics Laboratory at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nev. Scientists use the term \u201csnow crystal\u201d more than snowflake. According to Libbrecht\u2019s website, snowcrystals.com: \u201cA snow crystal, as the name implies, is a single crystal of ice. A snowflake is a more general term; it can mean an individual snow crystal, or a few snow crystals stuck together, or large agglomerations of snow crystals that form \u2018puff-balls\u2019 that float down from the clouds.\u201d A few facts about snow crystals: They are formed from water vapor that condenses directly into ice inside of clouds. They take shape as water vapor molecules from cloud droplets condense and freeze on the surface of a seed crystal, and patterns emerge as these crystals grow. The seed crystal itself forms on a tiny particle, like a speck of dust in the air, which serves as a base for ice growth. \u201cYou can actually see these ice nuclei in all snowflakes,\u201d Hallett said. \u201cNot with the naked eye or a regular microscope, but put it in an electromagnetic microscope and you will see it.\u201d Note: Snowflakes are not created from frozen raindrops. Liquid water that freezes in the atmosphere as it falls to the ground is actually sleet. And hail, Libbrecht said, is just a large piece of sleet that collects water and grows as it travels from the atmosphere to the ground. Water molecules \u2014 made of one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms each \u2014 are ultimately responsible for the familiar six-sided shape we associate with snowflakes. \u201cAtoms and molecules can hook up in different ways and, in the case of water, they like to hook up into a hexagonal lattice,\u201d said Libbrecht, who studies the physics of crystal growth. \u201cThat underlying structure is how the crystal gets its sixfold symmetry.\u201d Temperature and humidity are the two main factors that influence how the crystalline structure forms. If the temperature and humidity level changes, so does the growth pattern of the crystal. At low humidity you get simple plates and simple hexagonal blocks, Libbrecht said. At higher humidity, more branched structures. \u201c[A snowflake\u2019s] final shape is a history lesson of how the thing grew,\u201d Hallett said. \u201cThe outside edge of the crystal is where it grew last, and as you go inward you can tell [the conditions of] where it was before.\u201d And temperature also plays a major role in the forming of flakes. This diagram shows how shapes vary according to temperature:  From SnowCrystals.com: We see that thin plates and stars grow around -2 C (28 F), while columns and slender needles appear near -5 C (23 F). Plates and stars again form near -15 C (5 F), and a combination of plates and columns are made around -30 C (-22 F).  Furthermore, we see from the diagram that snow crystals tend to form simpler shapes when the humidity (supersaturation) is low, while more complex shapes at higher humidities. The most extreme shapes \u2014 long needles around -5C and large, thin plates around -15C \u2014 form when the humidity is especially high. But the physics is far from exact, Libbrecht said. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery as to why [snowflake shapes] go from plates to columns to plates to columns as the temperature lowers,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things I\u2019ve been trying to understand. It has been a mystery for about 75 years, and it\u2019s still unsolved.\u201d And though it may appear otherwise, the arms of a snowflake are not perfectly symmetrical. \u201cIf you look at the dendritic arms of a snowflake carefully, they usually are a bit different,\u201d Hallett said. \u201cThe atmosphere is a turbulent place, and crystals tend to oscillate as they are blown around, so even different corners see slightly different environments.\u201d So is it really true that no two snowflakes are alike? \u201cIt\u2019s like shuffling a deck and getting the exact same shuffle for 52 cards,\u201d Libbrecht said. \u201cYou could shuffle every second for the entire life of the universe, and you wouldn\u2019t come close to getting two of the same.\u201d  Video: How do snowflakes form?

            "answer_text": "What\u2019s behind the snowflake\u2019s unique and elaborate shape? Hi Xander. The water molecule is made of two gasses (odd for a liquid), expands when it freezes (odd compared to most else), and has the ability to crystallize (my kinda strange). A snowflake is a water crystal. What is behind the snowflake is a dirty little dust particle that phase change water droplets nucleate to, which is the seed of the crystal. One thing snowflake crystals have in common is hexagonal geometry, yet if you look fast you will see a lot of variety in the points and edges.  The \u2018unique\u2019 and elaborate shapes have to do with wind currents, water droplets, and temperature changes along the path that a snowflake takes as it is formed. I don\u2019t think snowflakes are all that unique. I\u2019ve seen many that look almost exactly alike. Elaborate, I\u2019ll give you that.     The wind goes all sorts of ways in a cloud.  What\u2019s behind a snowflake\u2019s shape? The shape of a water molecule is. ",
