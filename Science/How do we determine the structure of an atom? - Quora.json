            "answer_text": "It started with the discovery of basic Atomic Particles, Electrons, Protons and Neutrons. The second problem was to fit them in a structure. Rutherford\u2019s scattering experiment with Alpha particles and Gold film fixed a nucleus and extra nuclear part. Electrons were in the Extra nuclear part while nucleus was having Protons and Neutrons. Analysis of Spectroscopic data, research in Blackbody Radiation, Photoelectric effect, Developments in Quantum Mechanics, Particle physics has pushed this science to present level. Future is not that gloomy. Many new discoveries will certainly open up new vistas of this science. At present Particle Physicists know much more than what was known in early years of twentieth century. One big possibility is String Theory that is supposed to be TOE; unifying Force of Gravitation with other three basic forces which are already unified. Where is the end? No body knows. One thing is sure. Science is limited by its own constraints. Likely to meet its impossibilities surely. Much easier for believers of God. For them He knows all and whosoever realises Him also gets absolute knowledge. No need to search for minor truths when ultimate truth gives knowledge of all truths. Of course that is not atheists cup of tea. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "The word \u2018atom\u2019 has always been used to represent a particle that cannot be further cut into smaller particles. However, in the modern scientific terminology, the term \u2018atom\u2019 comprises of several subatomic particles. The particles constituting an atom are the electron, the proton, and the neutron. Electrons The electron is by far the smallest out of these three particles. At 9.11 x 10^-31 kg, carrying a negative electrical charge, the electron is too small in size to be measured using the current techniques. Usually, the electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus due to the attraction created from the opposite electric charges. If the electrons carried by an atom are more or fewer than its atomic number then the atom becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole. A charged atom is known as an ion. Protons The protons carry a positive charge and at 1.6726 x 10^-27 kg, have a mass 1836 times that of the electron. The atomic number represents the number of protons in an atom. Neutrons At 1.6929 x 10^-27 kg, neutrons are the heaviest of the three constituent particles of an atom. The neutrons carry no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1839 times the mass of the electron. Neutrons and protons have comparable dimensions although the surface of these particles is not clearly defined. Nucleus All the protons and neutrons that are held together in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus. They are collectively called nucleons. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential known as the residual strong force. The radius of the nucleus is much smaller than the radius of the atom. ISOTOPES: DIFFERENT TYPES OF ATOMS Isotopes are atoms in a chemical element having different numbers of neutrons than protons and electrons. The atoms in a particular element have the same number of protons and electrons but can carry varying numbers of neutrons. Let\u2019s understand the above with the example of the Hydrogen atom. Hydrogen\u2019s atomic number is 1 i.e. its nucleus contains 1 proton. It also has one electron. Therefore, the Hydrogen atom is neutral since it contains the same number of protons and electrons (as the positive and negative charges cancel each other out). However, approximately, one hydrogen atom out of 6000 contains a neutron in its nucleus. These atoms are still hydrogen because they have one proton and one electron; they simply have a neutron that most hydrogen atoms do not carry. Hence, these atoms are called Isotopes. There\u2019s also an isotope of hydrogen that contains two neutrons. It\u2019s called Tritium, it doesn\u2019t occur naturally on earth, but it can easily be created. Hope it helps :D ",

            "answer_text": "Structure of an atom\u2026.. Going all the way back to E. Rutherford, we know that atoms are mostly empty space with a small, dense, positively charge nucleus and electrons which are not in the nucleus. Thanks to Bohr and the developers of quantum mechanics we know that electrons exist in allowed energy states at various distances (on average) from the nucleus. Mass spectroscopy allows us to probe the atom to determine the mass of the nucleus and to predict the identity of the element. The atomic spectra of atoms allow us to identify the element based on its spectroscopic \u201cfingerprint\u201d and from that to make assumptions about how the electrons are arranged within the atom.
