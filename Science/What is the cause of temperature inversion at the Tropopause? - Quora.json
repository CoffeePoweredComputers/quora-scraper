            "answer_text": "Tropopause is the layer that separates Troposphere from Stratosphere.  It's from this part of the layer that ozone starts developing by absorbing UV rays from sun and it extends to almost top layer of the Stratosphere.  It's mainly because of the absorbed UV rays by Ozone that increases temperature in the Stratosphere with increasing height and a cause of thermal inversion at Tropopause. ",
