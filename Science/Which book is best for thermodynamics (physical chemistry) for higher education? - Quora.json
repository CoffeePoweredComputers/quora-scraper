            "answer_text": "Thermodynamics is fundamental study topic. It doesn't have theories emanating from any other branch of science. Thermodynamic concepts are applicable universally hence, either we study science subjects like Physics or Chemistry or Engineering like Chemical or Mechanical, we see application of the concepts. Hence: Higher education in science- Kinetics and thermodynamics for chemistry and biochemistry by Eli M. Pearce. Higher education in engineering ( chemical): a) Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics by KV Narayanan b) Introduction to Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics by JM Smith ( adapted by BI Bhatt). Kindly let me know for further clarification, if any. Regards Aditya K Singh ",
