            "answer_text": "In the UK teaching system, core science means the minimum amount of science you are required to learn. This means that every child has to at least take GCSE\u2019s in core science. Students can choose to take triple (also known as separate or additional) science as well. This is where they take exams explicitly in chemistry, physics and biology which contain extra information on top of the core syllabus. ",
