            "answer_text": "A black hole\u2019s size (as defined by its Schwarzschild radius) is dependent on its mass, so how big a black hole gets is entirely dependent on how much material is around to feed into its mass. The biggest black holes in the universe are the supermassive black holes that live in the center of galaxies, which are thought to form alongside the galaxy rather than from the death of a star, reaching masses millions of times the mass of the sun. The largest of these are sometimes called ultra-massive black holes, and can be tens of billions of times the mass of the sun. About 30 candidate objects matching this description have been found lurking in the center of galaxies, surrounded by extraordinarily enormous and bright accretion disks of in-falling material:  (Image Credit: Space Engine[1]) The current largest candidate is TON 618, which has an estimated mass of 66 billion solar masses, which corresponds to a Schwarzschild radius of 1,300 AU, where 1 AU is the distance between the Earth and the Sun. For comparison, the aphelion of Pluto\u2019s orbit (its furthest point from the sun), is just short of 50 AU\u2014meaning, you could line up 26 entire Solar Systems end to end and that would stretch across the diameter of this black hole. Even the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, which lives at the center of our own galaxy, is an estimated 0.16 AU in diameter. Here is a size comparison:  (Original Image Credit: Space Engine with modifications) The lower half of TON 618 in this computer generated image is obscured by its enormous accretion disk, which extends well outside the view of this image. Shown to scale is a set of small rings marking the outer perimeter of the Solar System\u2019s Kuiper Belt, as well as the orbits of Neptune, Uranus, & Saturn. The Earth\u2019s orbit would not even be the width of a pixel in this image. For further comparison, in the image below, the panel on the right could fit inside the blue ring in the image above:  (Original Image Credit: NASA/Caltech[2]with modifications) Sagittarius A* is shown to scale in the left panel on the top left. If we were to zoom in on that, this is what the sun would look like to scale:  (Original Image Credit: Wired/Paramount Pictures[3]with modifications) And lastly, here is a superimposed image of the Sun and the Earth to scale:  (Image Credit: NASA/GSFC[4]) That being said, TON 618\u2019s mass hasn\u2019t been as precisely measured as other ultra-massive black holes, such as H1821+643, which has a mass of 30 billion solar masses, and a corresponding radius of 575 AU, a little less than half the estimated radius of TON 618. This is the same order of magnitude, however, and so TON 618 is likely pretty close to the upper bound for how massive a black hole can get. Because these ultra-massive black holes form along side their parent galaxy, how big they get depends on the amount of material in the galaxy. Black holes can only get larger by accreting material or merging with another black hole. The observed distribution of mass in the most massive galaxies we can see suggest that once a black hole grows to about [math]10^{10}[/math] solar masses, the region of gas surrounding it is producing so much radiation that it drives an outward flow of material in the galactic nucleus, cutting off its own supply of gas. Once accretion stops, the only way for the black hole to gain in mass is if the galactic nucleus becomes supplied with more material through mergers with other galaxies. Galactic mergers could raise that upper bound to something closer to [math]10^{11}[/math] solar masses. Since TON 618 is still so optically bright, that means that it still has its accretion disk, which means that it is still growing in mass, but is likely towards the tail end, as its accretion disk is glowing with the brightness of 140 trillion suns, which is a truly absurd amount of radiation. Accretion will likely stop for this black hole within the next 100 million years, at which point it will lose its accretion disk and no longer be optically visible, aside from short-lived bursts of radiation from a star or cloud passing too close. This suggests that its unlikely we\u2019d actually be able to see the most massive black holes in the universe, which could potentially lie in the 100 billion solar mass range.

            "answer_text": "Theoretically, unlimited. In reality it depends on the mass available to incorporate into the BH. Currently the largest one found is about 17 billion solar masses. Its Event Horizon is larger than our solar system (out to Neptune). I have no doubt there are others out there (maybe beyond the visible Universe horizon) that are even larger, but we have almost no chance to detect and measure them. Since the Universe is expanding the proximity of BHs to available matter is lessening every day, meaning that many BHs will not have anything to incorporate and increase their own mass. ",

            "answer_text": "(Note: If we are dealing with event horizons of black holes, then I may state that Astronomers have found black holes with event horizons ranging from 6 miles to the size of our solar system. There is a separate question in Quora that deals with event horizons of black holes. Please see: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-size-of-a-black-hole) Standard black hole classification falls into four or five categories: i) Ordinary stellar mass black holes weigh-in at approximately 10 to 100 times the mass of our sun (1 SM 1 Solar mass). ii) The intermediate mass black holes have masses below 100,000 SM. iii) Supermassive holes are anything above that extending into the millions and even billions of times the mass of our sun. Anything up to 10 billion SM may be described as Supermassive black holes. iv) A few black holes seem to exceed even the description of Supermassive holes and these are referred to as Ultra-massive black holes. TN610 at 66 billion SM is one such. v) Another hypothetical class of black holes is primordial black holes, which would have formed out of density fluctuations in the early universe. Generally, they would have been so tiny that they can only be properly described using quantum mechanics. But black holes evaporate through a process called Hawking Radiation. How quickly a black hole evaporates depends on its mass: the less massive a black hole, the more quickly it evaporates. For a primordial black hole to have survived to the present day, it would have to contain a few billion tons of mass, with a radius comparable to that of an atomic nucleus. There\u2019s much we still don\u2019t know about how these biggest holes got so big, but gaining mass through these accretion disks clearly plays a prominent role. It seems however that accretion disks become increasingly unstable the bigger the supermassive black hole becomes. This instability appears to reach a breaking point causing the disk to completely fragment and collapse into stars in their own rights. As to how much is this breaking point might be, I have seen several guesstimates in the several august journals ranging between 10billion SM and 50 billion SM. In 2016, the Science daily stated thus: \u201cUntil now, the biggest supermassive black holes -- those with masses around 10 billion times that of our sun -- have been found at the cores of very large galaxies in regions loaded with other large galaxies. The current record holder, discovered in the Coma Cluster by the UC Berkeley team in 2011, tips the scale at 21 billion solar masses and is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.\u201d You can see that in 2019, we are unable to accept this statement TN610 is one Ultra-Massive black hole that at 66 billion SM defies description. The difficulty here in assigning a number stems from the fact that we do not know much about Supermassive/Ultramassive black holes even when we know that they have a size limitation ",

It\u2019s the largest black hole ever discovered and is heavier than our Sun by 40 billion times This black hole has a radius of just under 119 billion kilometers, a diameter of about 236 billion km. The tiny red dot in the middle is the size of our solar system including Pluto. The original \u2018star\u2019 S5 0014+81 should have had a diameter of 55,679,280,000,000,000 kilometers. 56 quadrillion kms. Or 1804 Parsecs - 5885 Light years. That\u2019s 5 times thicker than the Milky Way. And that\u2019s on the outside: From Marios Christodoulou and Carlo Rovelli, How big is a black hole?. How big is the black hole at the center of our galaxy? It's about 2 million kilometers across. That's pretty big - but the orbit of Mercury is 60 times bigger. This black hole is old, roughly a billion years old. And here's the cool part: it's been growing on the inside all this time! On the inside, it can hold a million solar systems! Its volume is about 10**34 cubic kilometers! And it's growing at a rate of about 10**25 cubic kilometers per year! This black hole will last a long time before it evaporates due to Hawking radiation. Christodolou and Rovelli estimate how big its volume will get before this happens. And it gets really big - bigger than the current-day observable universe! \u2026people falling into the black hole will not have time to do anything fun inside. They will hit the singularity in a short time. Very very roughly speaking, the problem is not the shortage of space inside the black hole, it's the shortage of time. If you fall into the black hole at the center of our galaxy, it will be about 1 minute, at most, before you hit the singularity. You will not get to see most of the space inside the black hole! The singularity is not in the 'middle' of the black hole - it's in your future. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking. Despite the large variety of answers, this is a rather simple question. There is no theoretical limit on how big a black hole can get. There may be some practical limitations. For example, there are theories that after a black hole reaches about 50 billion solar masses, it may have difficulty creating an accretion disk from which more mass is obtain, but it won\u2019t prevent the merger with another black hole or the consumption of an object moving directly toward it. And, there is the practical limit of not being able to consume more mass than what is in the gravitationally bound galaxy cluster in which it resides. EDITORIAL. This question with its 70 answers illustrates the problem with Cosmology questions/answers in Quora. Most of the answers are flat out wrong, have serious errors, or don\u2019t answer the question. Many are simply opinions with no scientific backing. Others use the question as means to propose their own pet theories \u2014 often philosophies with little or no scientific reasoning and ignoring observations and experimental evidence. And, then we have the answers that are simply a cut and paste from other sources, but often out of context. Most of the Cosmology questions on Quora aren\u2019t that hard. Black holes, universe expansion, CMB, and expansion of the universe are relatively simple concepts, especially at the level of questions being asked. Unfortunately, most of the answers are wrong or misleading. Quora should be a place you go for answers. For science, that means facts, not opinions. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem with questions like this is that the scale of the answer is most difficult to put into something that the human mind can appreciate at all levels. One of my instructors always put large numbers into something that we could see, feel or imagine and that allowed every listener, from top of the class to the lowly individual (or small number) at the bottom. For example he would offer that a \u201cbillion seconds is really 30 years\u201d and to explain a TRILLION seconds on the same scale \u201cit is 30,000 years\u201d. (Actually \u201c31,688 and a smidgen years\u201d but not important to the example so forgive his rounding error.) However, \u201cso many sun masses\u201d or \u201cso many trillions of miles or kilometers\u201d answers somehow lose their scale to most people. It should be understood that black holes are huge amount of mass more than they are distance alone. Two black holes combining only double their mass rather than become twice as large in size. Try this example to better grasp the mass of a black hole of extreme size: A black hole consisting of the MASS of the earth would be SMALLER than the nail on your little finger, but with the same gravitational force. Hope that helps to make sense out of how much mass must be in LARGE black holes. ",

            "answer_text": "It really depends on how much matter these is in the vicinity of the black hole for it to consume. Contrary to popular belief, black holes are not big vacuum cleaners. They act just like any other object with mass. The amount of gravitational influence a black hole has is solely dependent on its mass. If our sun was a black hole it would be about 6 kms across but the planets of the solar system would still orbit where they are. But if the mass was greater, then we will probably be in an orbit closer that we are now, proportional to the mass of the black hole. Black holes can only grow when they feed. Super-massive black holes, millions to billions of times the mass of the sun occur at the center of most, if not all, galaxies. Such monstrously large black holes have existed since the universe was very young however, it still remains somewhat of a mystery how these giants could have grown so big in the relatively short amount of time they had to form. Early in the history of the universe, massive stars were relatively common because there was plenty of molecular gas and dust clouds around and they were tightly packed but these stars lived very short lives. Around 10 million years is the average life span of these massive stars and these are the stars that will likely end up as black holes or neutron stars. The common belief is that the early universe was a lot denser than it is now and there was plenty of matter drifting around. Because the early black holes were able to form very quickly, they were able to attract a lot matter such as gas clouds and even stars that drift too close, thereby growing quickly. As the density of the matter within the gravitational influence of the black hole begins runs out, the black hole slowly become dormant until something drifts too close and thereby gets pulled into the black hole, forever lost\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. It is thought that this below is what happens to a star that gets too close to a black hole. After the star got too close it was caught in the gravitational influence of the black hole. The white portion is the matter being heated as it swirls around the accretion disk and the black dot in the middle is the event horizon. Once anything passes beyond the event horizon, it is forever gone as even light cannot escape once it crosses the event horizon.  Image of what a feeding black hole would probably look like ",

            "answer_text": "To me, galaxies began their lives as single masses of fusion powered plasma. How big the black hole gets boils down to how big the initial mass was and how fast the mass was spinning when it was created in the collision of two objects better known as the big bang. Some galaxies weren't spinning at all and created elliptical ones where the matter was released directly from the center. This situation hides the black hole with the visible light that the cooling matter releases. Spiral galaxies such as our own use centrifugal force to distribute the matter into a giant disk with a bulbous center initially. Eventually, the center separates and the black hole is born leaving the stars and their corresponding solar systems to be created with the remaining disk of plasma. Based on a couple of factors, the center could constitute most of the matter of the galaxy or could end up like ours in which the black hole is only a relatively small percentage of the galaxy. ",

            "answer_text": "How big can a black hole get ? Thanks Phil for asking, this is one of my favourite subjects. The question of Black hole minimum and maximum dimensions (radius) is more a question about the choice of definition. Must we define a black hole by its physical reality (science doesn\u2019t know) or by its none physical outer not observable boundary (science does know) ? To start with the last option : the Schwarzschild radius only depends on its mass and can be well calculated once we know its mass. The two most massive black holes we have observed indirectly and measured have a mass of about 50 billion sun masses. According Schwarzschild radius equations they have a radius of about 212317 sun radius, a staggering 148 trillion metre (148 billion km). There is no reason to assume they will ever stop accreting mass, so they will grow in mass and will grow bigger. \u2026.. But as mentioned above, a Schwarzschild radius is meaningless as an accurate physical radius. There is nothing there, at the Schwarzschild radius, there is no matter and the temperature is almost 0 Kelvin. Way deep inside, hidden from sight, is its mass, being extremely dense and extremely hot. 99,99999\u2026\u20269 % of a black hole\u2019s Schwarzschild radius volume is just empty space. According science this hot and dense centre mass of a black hole has no radius, meaning that when scientists try to calculate it (with tried and trusted theory) they find an infinity. Finding infinities is disastrous for scientists, meaning something is terribly wrong with their equations. When such a black hole increases in mass, its calculated radius is still meaningless infinitely small or big. So there\u2019s where science today still is with black holes accreting mass all the time : a meaningless big radius that is steadily growing on the one side and a meaningless infinitely small radius on the other side that is neither growing nor shrinking. I have developed a theory of quantum gravity, outside the tried and trusted theory, that opens a different perspective about the physical radius of any black hole. I have formulated two formulas to calculate its limits in between certain uncertainties. I have called it the \u201cWhitney Limit\u201d and that\u2019s a Dutch absurdist joke for \u201cknowing\u201d what we cannot know. Whitney is a girlfriend that I tried to explain my theory and while trying, I got the idea to use her name for the limit she couldn\u2019t understand. When I calculate the Whitney Limit for the two most massive black holes we know, about 50 billion sun masses, I get a radius of about 0,05 sun radius and that is only 34,8 million metres or 34800 km. That is somewhere in between Neptune and Saturn. That is in my opinion how big the biggest known black holes did get and they are growing millimetre by millimetre as we speak. ",

            "answer_text": "The most massive black hole observed is: TON 618 - Wikipedia  https://aminoapps.com/c/space/page/blog/ton-618-biggest-quasar/n5kJ_wxzFLuMX0RK0BNxevnjLbEr3vb3EBz  This has an estimate mass of 66 billion solar masses, and a radius of 1300 AU. That means 1300 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. It would take light 15 days to cross the distance of the diameter. I found this black hole list on List of most massive black holes. The list is updated fairly regularly, so future readers may find this is no longer the largest known. Now there is a theoretical limit of 50 billion solar masses. Which makes Ton 618 black hole a bit of a mystery. But that limit is based on the super massive black hole being unable to stream hydrogen from a star without a majority of the mass radiating away. It is still possible for a black hole to continue to gain mass slowly, and to merge with other black holes. So the most likely explanation is two extremely large super massive blackholes merged together. Also the 50 billion solar mass limit is really more of an order of magnitude calculation, so it is not unbelievable that it could be off by a factor of 2. But observation tells us the 50 billion solar mass limit is close to correct. Now if you had a way to bring in more black holes to merge, the only limit in black hole mass is just how many black holes you had available. An interesting side-note, it has been show if black holes could absorb dark matter, and dark matter was uniformly distributed in a galaxy, we would expect black holes at least 5 billion solar masses to rapidly grow to about 500 billion solar masses as they absorb dark matter in the core of the galaxy. That would correspond to a black hole about half a light year across. But no black holes that large have been observed, giving us yet another mystery about dark matter. ",

Monster Black Hole Is Biggest Ever Found By Elizabeth Howell, Space.com Contributor | November 28, 2012 01:01pm ET   This image shows the disk galaxy NGC 1277, as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope. The small, flattened galaxy has one of the biggest central super-massive black holes ever found in its center, the equivalent of 17 billion suns. Credit: NASA / ESA / Andrew C. Fabian / Remco C. E. van den Bosch (MPIA) Astronomers have discovered what may be the most massive black hole ever known in a small galaxy about 250 million light-years from Earth, scientists say. The supermassive black hole has a mass equivalent to 17 billion suns and is located inside the galaxy NGC 1277 in the constellation Perseus. It makes up about 14 percent of its host galaxy's mass, compared with the 0.1 percent a normal black hole would represent, scientists said. \"This is a really oddball galaxy,\" said study team member Karl Gebhardt of the University of Texas at Austin in a statement. \"It's almost all black hole. This could be the first object in a new class of galaxy-black hole systems.\" Advertisement The giant black hole is about 11 times as wide as the orbit of Neptune around our sun, researchers said. The mass is so far above normal that the scientists took a year to double-check and submit their research paper for publication, according to the study's lead author, Remco van den Bosch. \"The first time I calculated it, I thought I must have done something wrong. We tried it again with the same instrument, then a different instrument,\" van den Bosch, an astronomer at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, told Space.com. \"Then I thought, 'Maybe something else is happening.'\" [Strangest Black Holes in the Universe] ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an interesting question. It would depend on the nature of how large stars can get, as black holes are the remnants of collapsed stars no longer actively undergoing nuclear fusion to produce light etc. It also depends on the rate at which the black hole would continue to engulf matter such as star matter, as this would result in an increase in mass. Black holes can consume thousands of solar masses of star matter, resulting in an active state known as Quasars:  The largest black hole is in the order of 40 billion solar masses, although this may not be a limit to their size. Eventually all the matter in the Universe may have been engulfed by black holes, such that that is all that is left. Once this occurs, the black holes would start losing mass through \u2018Hawking radiation\u2019, although this would take a vast and unimaginable period of time. Black holes also gain mass through merging with other black holes. Hope this helps. ",

To put it into perspective, stellar mass black holes would be several solar masses. Think something about the size of a planet but with a mass of 5 or 6 times that of our sun. Supermassive black holes are found at the centers of large galaxies like ours. Sagittarius A*, the one at the center of our galaxy, is about 4 million solar masses. The one at the center of Andromeda is considerably larger, perhaps between 30\u2013200 million solar masses. There is growing evidence of intermediate mass black holes, i.e., those between stellar mass and supermassive varieties. But that is nothing in the grand scale of things. The black hole named TON 618 is estimated to be 66 billion solar masses. To put this into perspective, this is more massive than some galaxies. This is probably the largest black hole ever discovered. But it is possible for the black hole at the center of galaxy IC 1101 to be even more massive. How massive can they get? Who knows. Perhaps there is an upper limit to how much gravitational energy you can concentrate in such a confined space. ",

            "answer_text": "To the best of our understanding, there is no limit. Any matter or energy that crosses the event horizon of a black hole is incorporated into the black hole. The event horizon expands to accommodate the extra mass. As to how big a black hole can get, the biggest known are at the centres of galaxies and can have a mass millions of times that of the sun. As the Universe evolves, black holes are likely to grow, so that galactic-mass black holes are likely to form. There is an opposing process known as Hawking Radiation (see Hawking radiation - Wikipedia) through which black holes 'evaporate', but this is an extremely slow process for stellar-mass and larger black holes, with growth through infalling material (dust, gas, the occasional star) likely to dominate for billions (likely trillions) of years. As the Universe expands, distant galaxies will disappear over the horizon of the observable Universe, where the rate of Hubble expansion of space (see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law) exceeds the speed of light. In due course, it is believed that only the Local Group of galaxies will be observable and be able to interact with each other. Within the Local Group, gravity dominates over the more general Hubble expansion and galaxies within it are predicted to stay together, indeed with a long term tendency to merge. This suggests a likely upper limit to the size of black holes that are likely to form - a galactic cluster like the Local Group. Although, so far as is known, there is no theoretical upper limit. ",

            "answer_text": "Brief answer: The biggest black hole is the central black hole in every galaxy. Due to natural law, the natural mechanisms spontaneously regulate the size of the central black hole to the oscillation range of the mass state matter --- energy state matter transformation critical mass. More explanation: The biggest black hole is the central black holes in the centre of every galaxy. Due to natural law regulation, matter contact congregation cannot go over too much in the range of the oscillation in the dynamic balance of the size of the mass state matter \u2013 energy state matter transformation critical mass. This mass congregation is the concentrative \u2013 dissipative structure (central black hole) that converts the positive thermodynamic entropy into the negative thermodynamic entropy. There is the natural spontaneous dynamic balancing mechanisms at work to regulate the size of the central black holes: the bigger, the more violent the mass state matter to be transformed into energy state matter and be cast out into the vast space; smaller than the mass state matter \u2013 energy state matter transformation critical mass, the mass state matter \u2013 energy state matter transformation stops and no mass will be cast out, and in the meantime nothing can stop it from drawing in mass to feed its size growth. Everything is a fair game, including the smaller black holes. Two or more central black hole can merge though sooner or later the size will be spontaneously regulated to the oscillating range of the mass state matter \u2013 energy state matter transformation critical mass. This natural positive boosting and negative restraining mechanisms that alternatively taking over the process is the reason there cannot be any Big Crunch or Big Bang in the universe --- natural laws not allow. This periodic oscillation between the positive boosting and negative restraining mechanisms alternatively taking over the control of the process in the central black hole is a long period to us that makes us think some central black holes are permanently quiet while some others are permanently noisy (with their two opposite jets of light beams), actually they are just in their different phases in the oscillation period. Therefore, if you cannot see the quiet ones that don\u2019t jet out light beams and may be blocked out of view by thick dust clouds, it does not mean it is not there in the centre of that galaxy. It just has to be there due the natural law that defined the gravity of mass. ",

The Observable universe has a Schwarzschild radius of approximately 13.7 billion light years. Its actual diameter is 45.7 billion light-years.

            "answer_text": "At least theoretically, there is no limit to how big (the event horizon) can be. It just depends on the mass. In a rich cluster of galaxies, where galaxies can collide with each other on a frequent basis (using astronomical time scales to define \u201cfrequent\u201d), it is conceivable that a black hole might eventually acquire a substantial fraction of the mass of the cluster. Since such clusters contain up to hundreds or thousands of trillions of stars, that could make the mass of a black hole a trillion or more solar masses, in which case the radius of the event horizon could be in excess of 3 trillion kilometers (3 km being the radius of a one-solar-mass\u2019 event horizon), or about 20 thousand AUs, which is about 1/3 of a light year. And although 20 thousand AUs is a large distance, it isn\u2019t as big as the radius of the Oort Cloud (estimated to be about 30 thousand AUs), so although it\u2019s a lot bigger than the orbit of Pluto (which is a mere 40 AUs), it isn\u2019t as big as the entire Solar System. Btw, supermassive black holes are not created by the collapse of stellar masses, as implied in the case of the \u201cstar\u201d that turned into black hole S5 0014+81. The most massive stars are only about two to three hundred solar masses (and perhaps not even that massive), so supermassive black holes are formed by the collapse of large amounts of gas in the centers of forming galaxies, and grow by collisions with black holes from other galaxies, when galaxies in clusters collide with each other. So any estimate of the supposed original size of that nonexistent star is meaningless. ",

I remember reading somewhere that there is an upper limit for the size of a black hole, and it is somewhere around 50 billion solar masses. The size of such a black hole would be thousands of times larger than our solar system. How\u2019s that for a scary thought! The reason why there is an upper limit, and this is theoretical, but supported by mathematics, is that a black hole at that upper limit is growing to that size because it is gobbling up material. The accretion disk of a black hole of that size would be so energetic, that eventually this energy would drive away all of the other things in the vicinity of the black hole. So the black hole is in a sense starving itself by getting that big. ",

Stated simply, I am not aware of there being a limit on the size of black holes (and so I assume there is no limit). See Black hole - Wikipedia Once the black hole has a mass that is larger than the moon, the rate of its evaporation is slower than its rate of growth from absorbing background radiation of space and so it would seem to be stable. I am not aware of a mechanism for a larger size of black holes to become unstable. However, I don\u2019t know much about black holes, and I am just a patent agent with a Ph.D. in physics. ",

So in theory if you could somehow cause all the mass of the universe to slowly get near the blackhole, then it would slowly get more and more massive. Start by taking all the black holes in the universe and aim them towards a single spot. If all their speeds are set so they reach the same place, at the same time, then they will all merge into one super massive blackhole. Then start aiming all the other stars towards that same point, to arrive just after the blackhole merger. You could end up with a blackhole with the mass of the universe. \u2026now how big would that be? Big enough. ",

There does appear to be a limit to how much a black hole can ingest all at once. Old Quasars are essentially very active super massive black holes. They are very far away, so their size is usually hard to approximate, but they are so bright that they shine brighter than some galaxies. They are estimate to be 1 to 2 light years across. However, that would include the active material being ejected. But, in theory, as long as material can fall directly into the black hole, it will absorb it. ",

The other thing is rotation, all bodies eventually start to rotate. Coriolis and centrifugal force are causes for death for others big stars (like white dwarf). And the last is asymmetrical eating.

Also many planets dragged to the Black Hole are overheating and they may produce huge blast just on one side. Not known, but it may destroy Black Hole. ",

Other factors point in the same direction; the massive amounts of hydrogen consumed in fusion by all the stars in a galaxy have to come from somewhere. The obvious source are black holes evaporating the equivalent amounts of energy, dark energy and possibly dark matter, later reconstituted into sub particles and particles on up to hydrogen, the main fuel for all the stars.
