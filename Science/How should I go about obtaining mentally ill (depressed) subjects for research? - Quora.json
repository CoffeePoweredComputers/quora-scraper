            "answer_text": "What university do you attend? Your program should have an IRB process, established research labs, and research advisers who could guide you through this process. Ideally, one of your professors already does research on major depressive disorder and could steer you in the right direction. There are a variety of ways to obtain participants for research. If your study is based on a questionnaire, many will use websites like Survey Monkey to create an online questionnaire. This can be distributed fairly easily to a wide range of participants. You may be able to work with local institutions in getting participants interested in your study. Nearby hospitals, clinics, counselling centers, and private practices which specialize in treatment for depression may be able to assist you in distributing your brochure/flyer/advertisement to potential participants. You mention you are not in a clinical program, so I assume you must be a Ph.D. in an experimental psychology program. While you cannot give a clinical diagnosis without a license in clinical psychology, you can still decide who qualifies as depressed for your study without diagnosing anyone. I have previously done research in epidemiology and have read many research articles in which people with doctorates in epidemiology and public health set their own standards for participant inclusion for individuals they considered to be sufficiently depressed. They would not diagnose the person with MDD, but would refer to them as \u201cdepressive\u201d or \u201cdepressed\u201d or some other term which does not hold a specific clinical value. If you were to go the route of finding participants through treatment settings, the patients would already have the diagnoses, saving you the difficulty of screening (for the most part). Without it, for the purposes of research, you could provide depression inventories to the participants as a screener. There are lots of quick and easy to administer screeners for this purpose. Perhaps the most popular is the Beck Depression Inventory - II. You would not need to be a licensed psychologist to administer this. According to the Association for Assessment in Counselling, \u201cThe instructions of the BDI-II are straightforward and clearly stated. Little training is required to administer or score the test. These two functions may be carried out by paraprofessionals.\u201d You would need to review the manual for the test of course, but administration is extremely straight forward. You essentially hand it to the person and ask them to read the questionnaire and complete it. ",
