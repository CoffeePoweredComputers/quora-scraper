            "answer_text": "A doctorate or doctoral degree is the highest degree granted in an academic discipline, also called a terminal degree.  Examples include doctor of philosophy (Ph.D. or D.Phil.), doctor of science (Sc.D.), and doctor of education (Ed.D.). These are research degrees and usually involve writing and defending a doctoral thesis. Other examples involve professional degrees, such as juris doctor (J.D.), doctor of medicine (M.D.), doctor of osteopathic medicine (D.O.), doctor of optometry (O.D.), doctor of veterinary medicine (D.V.M.), doctor of dental surgery (D.D.S.) and doctor of pharmacy (Pharm.D.). These do not necessarily involve a research component or a doctoral thesis. Recipients of any of these degrees may use the honorific \"Dr.\" as a prefix to their name, but many will instead use the abbreviation specific to their degree as a suffix. ",
