            "answer_text": "Well it depends on what you mean by the word \u201cinvent\u201d. The idea of using electricity to create light was first investigated over 200 years ago by an English chemist Humphrey Davy. He demonstrated that an electric current flowing through wires could heat them up to produce light. Unfortunately the materials suitable and the equipment needed to provide an environment to keep the filament alive for a reasonable amount of time were not yet available. If you want to be historically and technically correct the first electrically powered \u201clight bulb\u201d was invented in 1840 by a British scientist, Warren de la Rue. Problem is he used platinum as a filament. Unfortunately, however, platinum as a filament made the item too expensive for commercial sale. In 1848 another British scientist, William Saite, improved on the light bulbs\u2019s longevity but here it was the cost of the batteries which powered his light bulb that doomed his improvement to commercial failure. Yet again, in 1850, an English chemist named Joseph Swann developed a carbonized paper filament bulb. Problem was his first bulb needed a vacuum to operate within but the vacuum pumps of the day were so poor that they could not provide a sufficient enough of a vacuum needed to keep the bulb alive, which by the late 1870\u2019s was solved with the advent of more powerful vacuum pumps, allowing him in 1878 to finally publicly demonstrate his light bulb. Later he and Edison would fight over the patent rights to the electric light bulb which would lead to them joining forces and creating Edison-Swann United , which became one of largest manufacturers of light bulbs in the world. What Edison, or perhaps more correctly, Edison and his team of engineers and scientist did was improve on the filament\u2019s electrical resistance and, viola, finally a commercially viable electric light bulb could be marketed! However, it too had its limitations as it only lasted about 1200 hours or about 50 days. Then an American, who also happens to be Black, named Lewis Latimer, in 1882, about two to three years after Edison filed his patent on an electric light bulb, filed for a patent which greatly improved the filament used in these bulbsl All of these filaments were eventually replaced with the tungsten filaments that we see in today\u2019s incandescent light bulbs which have rightly are being replaced by fluorescent and LED light bulbs. So, no, Edison did not invent the light bulb! Its only true that he and his team at Menlo Park developed and received a US patent for a commercially viable electric light bulb. ",

            "answer_text": "Lewis Howard Latimer (1848\u20131928) was an African-American inventor who has been incorrectly called the inventor of the flush toilet, the light bulb and other useful things. A Civil War veteran, he worked for inventors Alexander Graham Bell, Hiram Percy Maxim and Thomas Edison. He was a skilled electrical expert. He learned drafting at a patent law firm, then did patent drawings for Bell's telephone patent. I've found no evidence that he helped Bell invent it. He invented an improved railway car toilet. But he did not invent a flush toilet, and his did not revolutionize the field. It just dumped the excrement on the tracks when the seat cover was closed. He worked for Maxim, who was a light bulb making rival of Edison. Edison already had light bulbs in service under the Edison patent, but Latimer invented an improved filament and sold his patent to Maxim in 1881. In 1882 he patented another improvement. It was still a carbon filament, and those were replaced by tungsten filaments in the early 20th century In 1884 Edison hired him as an expert to help with litigation about light bulb patents. Latimer literally wrote the book on electric lighting: Incandescent Electric Lighting \"Incandescent electric lighting,\" by L. H. Latimer, 1890, Van Nostrand. ",

            "answer_text": "No, a Black man didn't invent the light bulb. But Lewis Howard Latimer improved it and made it better.  Edison's bulb Beginning in 1878, Thomas Edison spent over a year trying to develop an incandescent light bulb using electricity to heat a thin filament. Edison's bulb looked a lot like what we're used to -- a filament in a glass bulb. But after years of experiments and thousands of tests of various filament materials, his longest-lasting light bulb could only last for about 15 hours before the filament burned out. Latimer's improvements Around the same time Edison was experimenting with his bulb -- using carbonized filaments of bay wood, cedar, bamboo and other fibers -- so was Latimer. Born just a year after Edison in 1848, Latimer was an inventor known for working closely with Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the telephone. According the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Latimer improved upon Edison's original design. Latimer created a light bulb with a more durable filament made of carbon. He sold the patent to the US Electric Co. in 1881, and a year later patented a process for efficiently manufacturing the carbon filament. Because of Latimer's contributions, incandescent light bulbs became more affordable and practical, MIT says, thus transforming American culture. No, a Black man didn't invent the light bulb. But Lewis Latimer made it better ",

Edison and his company did a lot of work on it, and Latimer played a large role (sometimes while working for Edison). The light bulb is often used metaphorically to indicate a flash of insight. So we want to name an individual who had that flash of insight and invented it, but that just doesn\u2019t match reality on something like this.
