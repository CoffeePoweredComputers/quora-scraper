            "answer_text": "Hibernation is a process by which many animals (very popular with reptiles and even mammals) undergo some major physiological changes which leads them to a state of rest in order to survive situations of very little availability of food which fuels all metabolic processes for staying alive.  Hibernation and migration alike are adaptation strategies of animals to cope with harsh winter season. The cold temperature during winters and limited sunlight are unfavourable conditions for plant growth which is the primary energy source in the food chain. Most animals hunt/gather food on a daily basis. Very few animals actually store food. Since the sources of energy i.e. food becomes limited in winters, animals have evolved to survive winters by changing their physiology such that they now require very little energy for basic metabolism. Both warm blooded and cold blooded animals hibernate.  Now, why don't human being hibernate?Well, here is what I think:1.You see, human beings are way smarter than these other animals. We don't just rely on natural instincts so much and sometimes defy nature's direction to living. Since our brain has evolved to make us much more 'intelligent' than other animals, we have managed to learn to gather, process, store food that is required to fuel our normal metabolism even during a shortage. I think our body has not evolved to undergo these physiological changes for adaptation because our intelligence has helped us survive. 2. Warm blooded animals use a of energy to maintain body temperature. This becomes more important when the temperature drops causing more expenditure of energy for maintaining body temperature. Hibernating animals sometimes mimic cold blooded animals in this state. Their basic metabolic processes drop down to just enable the organism to survive and do nothing else. This will prevent loss of too much heat and the animal can survive with very little food. However, we humans have found alternate methods for keeping warm. From the discovery of 'fire' to the invention of heaters, we know how to increase the temperature in our surrounding to reduce heat loss from our body. So, once again there was no need to undergo these physiological changes for adaptation.  This is all I have for now. I will add to the answer when I get time to think more about this.  Hope it helped.  :-) ",

            "answer_text": "Animals hibernate when food is scarce, in order to conserve energy during times when they would normally die of starvation were they to expend normal amounts of energy. Humans on the other hand, developed myostatin. Humans previously in the evolutionary timeline, did not shed the muscle they developed. Muscle eats up a lot of energy. Rather than begin to hibernate, humans chose to move and travel and follow their food. Myostatin allowed for humans to shed unnecessary muscle, allowing them to travel further, faster. It also allowed us to retain and store excess energy in the form of body fat. Humans who suffer from myostatin deficiency, have usually twice as much muscle mass as a more normal human, a very dense skeletal structure, and a very very low body fat content, regardless of their diet and amount they work out.  This deficiency also comes with the excess risks of something like cancer, bone spurs, needing to take in much more energy than a more average person, etc. Developing myostatin vs hibernation also comes with another benefit- While hibernation allows for animals to go months without eating, developing myostatin also allowed humans to go for around a month or so without eating. unlike say a bear, we can stay alert and ready to handle threats the majority of the time. A huge boon back then for our species survival. All in all, the development of myostatin vs hibernation was a huge benefit to the human race, and we are much better off for it. ",
