            "answer_text": "I think you are asking about concepts as independent or nearly so from their representation. In math, we have formal notation, proof reading and writing standards, formulas and normal computations, and also explanatory passages. These are all appropriate for what we want to do, when teaching and learning mathematics, though when we approach a concept it must necessarily be from many angles or vantages. We want to test that person\u2019s conceptual grasp across a broad range of cases, ask many types of problems, and vary or change parts of the concept or specific problem. This will test the adaptation of the examinee, how well he or she can formulate the concept, and work with changing conditions, where transformation is very important. I would say that transformation is the surface concept you want to have in a mathematics student, and representation the underlying principle. I say that because you cannot talk sensibly about mathematics without a representation, such as a number, equation or formula, symbolic notation, words and spells, passages or oral dialogues as some examples.

Unfortunately, the American educational system doesn\u2019t teach mathematical concepts at all, at least, not until high school, and then they complain about algebra being hard. Go back and slowly understand addition and equality. ",

If you sincerely do it then and there itself in the first time revise it thrice, then you will escape from future time taking arduous revision. You would quickly grasp the concept and deep understanding would come most faster than the average people. This is tried and tested method, works everytime for everything, not just Mathematics. But mind that you need to devote time. You cannot escape hard work and time devotion. Success is garuenteed and bound to come for earnest sincere efforts but not through shortcut. Always remember this mantra \u201cThrice you practice, never you forget.\u201d Now coming to \u201cquickly part!\u201d, It all depends upon the degree of concentration and degree of detachment from the world.
