            "answer_text": "CH3 is not a chemical compound but is a chemical radical (or chemical group). In fact, it is a group that must be always attached to others atoms in order to exist. The name is Methyl group and is very common in organic chemistry. You can find it in most organic molecules.It can also exists as Radical CH3*, or Cation CH3+, or anion CH3\u2013, but these products has a life time of few millisec because are very unstable. ",

IUPAC name of CH3 is methyl, it is the smallest member of alkyl group, which are formed by the removal of one H from lower alkanes like methane CH4, ethane C2H6 and so on. Out of 4 valances, 3 valances of carbon are satisfied by 3 hydrogen atoms leaving one electron unbounded or unpaired . It is also denoted by(.CH3 )where the dot (.) shows the unpaired valence electron and it is also known as methyl free radical. ",
