            "answer_text": "I find David Riddell\u2019s answer the most interesting and accurate, but I take issue with his size estimates. My bestselling semi-autobiographical Cold War novel, Operation Ivy Bells, commences with an encounter at 1,000 feet with three Humboldt Squid that were eight feet or longer (2.5 m) and that coordinated their attack on the two divers diving out of the Personnel Transfer Capsule. This event is based upon my personal Humboldt Squid experience diving with my friend Scott Cassell, who has filmed many large squid including an Architeuthis dux that he estimated to be over 40 ft (12.5 m) long. You can click on the above link to get the book and experience the excitement of confronting three aggressive squid larger than a man. Following is a photo of a large Humboldt Squid.  ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re using \u201cgiant squid\u201d in the strictest sense, to mean members of the genus Architeuthis, then the biggest known individuals are up to about five metres long, including the mantle, head and arms, but excluding the two long tentacles. In life, these don\u2019t usually extend much beyond the arms (the eight shorter appendages around the mouth), but in dead squid they relax and can be stretched out to great lengths, which accounts for the huge lengths (20m or more) often attributed to giant squids. Weight is probably a more useful measure of overall size for such elastic animals - a large female Architeuthis (males are smaller) can reach 275kg. By comparison, the heaviest human ever recorded weighed 635kg, and an adult bull weighs between 500kg and 1000kg. So giant squids really aren\u2019t that big - talk of them being bigger than a double-decker bus is fantasy, and based on those over-stretched tentacle measurements mentioned above. There is a squid that\u2019s larger than Architeuthis, called the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni). The largest specimen ever collected was 4.2m in length (the tentacles contracted in the preservative before it was measured) and weighed 495kg. It\u2019s estimated that the species could reach a maximum size of about 750kg. ",
