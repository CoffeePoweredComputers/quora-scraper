            "answer_text": "A very good answer by William Halmeck regarding the energetics of the metabolic reaction. But I think a structural description will add to his explanation. The lowering of the activation energy is achieved by two \u201cmechanical\u201d processes. The first one of which is the \u201cpositioning\u201d of the reactants in immediate proximity to each other. Enzymes have an \u201cactive site\u201d which not only fits the reactants (A and BC), but orients them with respect to each other (so the B part of BC faces A). This, in itself, favors the reaction more than random collisions of A molecules with BC molecules in a non-enzyme environment. The second \u201cmechanical\u201d process may be more accurately described as \u201centropic,\u201d in which an ATP (or a related \u201cenergy molecule\u201d) binds to the enzyme, hydrolyzes, and \u201cpushes\u201d the reactants to react with each other. You might think about this as the electricity that powers a spot-welding device, or the hand pressure that operates a paper stapler. All these analogies might help us understand roughly how an enzyme works, but there is serious misleadingness involved, too. Most of our macro tools and assembling devices are hard and stiff, where we can pretty easily see how pushing here causes pressure there. But enzymes and molecules are soft and squishy, so it\u2019s more like a tool made of sponges and Jello, where a little \u201chand-waving\u201d mystery is involved. Nevertheless, tools and enzymes both get the job done. Thanks for the question. ",
