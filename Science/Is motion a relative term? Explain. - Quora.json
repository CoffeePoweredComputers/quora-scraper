            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Without reference you cannot say whether the system is moving or not. For an instance consider a spherical ball in space and it is isolated from all other objects. Then how can you determine whether it is moving or not? You need some reference point to determine whether it is moving or not. And the reference point determines the motion of the particle in it's frame which is agian relative wrt to you. Consider an example Consider you are sitting in a car. Let a tree be in front of you. Now start your engine and call your friend to get in the car. Now accelerate the car. You can observe that the tree is moving towards you. Is it true? Or you are moving towards the tree? So motion is completely relative. We consider here earth to be huge and so it is you moving not earth(tree).While moving observe the motion of your friend. He is relatively at rest wrt you. Now consider friend 2 on the road at rest wrt earth. With respect to friend 2, you and your friend 1 are moving with some velocity. While your friend 1 is rest wrt you, for friend 2 he is in motion.So you can conclude taht motion is always relative. If there is no point of reference, then you cannot say that the particle has motion in a particular direction or atleast it is in motion. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, motion is a relative term. Imagine you are in a spaceship in space. You look outside and its completely dark. There is nothing else than dark space. Now even though the spaceship is moving in any direction with any speed, you feel you are at rest because there is nothing you see relative to which you are moving. So you need relative objects to see motion. Now if you are moving in some direction and you cross another spaceship, you feel that is was coming in reverse direction and crossed you while you were at rest. Similarly, if you are sitting in a car moving on a road, a person standing on the road would feel that the car and all the people in it are moving forward. You will feel the man is moving backwards and the people with you are at rest. So it only depends on the objects relative to which you see motion. If you change it, motion changes. ",
