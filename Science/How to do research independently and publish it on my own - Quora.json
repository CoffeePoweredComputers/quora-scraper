Bates and Joseph Wang Okay, many are and will continue to say that you NEED an advisor, that you NEED funding , that you NEED a lab to be associated with, that you NEED a professor to guide you. Is that really true?  Nikola Tesla - One of the earliest independent scientists Lets back up for a moment - what is a research paper after all?[1] A research paper is the culmination and final product of an involved process of research, critical thinking, source evaluation, organization, and composition. There is research, critical thinking, evaluation, organization and composition. I don\u2019t see any other \u201chave to\u2019s\u201d here! What you NEED to do, though? Read a lot of research in your domain.If you have read a lot of papers, you know what is considered an idea worth publishing. Again, your idea need not be path breaking to begin with. Any idea requires nourishment before it can be presented. So take your basic ideas and spend more time working on them. Identify different possibilities, test them out, record the tests for your reference later. Go back and read more.Keep your notes and results organized in one place. This will be the base on which you will be writing your research paper on. There are a lot of tools to aggregate all your sources and references.Identify a journal in your domain - is there something specific like the American Chemical Society or American Physical Society? There are always the generic but popular ones like Elsevier, Wiley etc. Find out what kind of papers are published in these journals, what is the level of quality you have to attain to get published. You can always submit to an another journal if your paper gets rejected. And when that happens, you will not be the first researcher to get rejected before getting published :)Against usual advice, start writing as you research. In this amazing talk, Simon Peyton Jones from Microsoft Research explains how writing can quick start your thought process on your research. Writing can help you think through your arguments and present a formidable case. You can quickly get started with a MS Word template.There\u2019s a lot of grey areas to presenting your research to an advisor - there are some who can genuinely help you and others who just want a name on your paper as a co-author. Better than an advisor, get a mentor. Someone who has been there, done that aka published a paper.Use tools available to weed out unwanted parts of your research process. For example, for following author guidelines and formatting, try Typeset - it automatically applies all the rules on your content in a click. You can use a reference library such as Mendeley to discover and collect all your references as you research. So when you are ready to write your paper you can quickly get your sources in a click. If your research workflow is online you can also use Paperpile.Now, this is in no way comprehensive. Research cannot be comprehended in a Quora post. Get started, you will find your way through :) In case you want to read more - What are useful tools for writing academic papersHow to write a great research paperHow to write an effective research paper\u2026The top 100 papersWhat are the steps to follow for writing a research paper?Footnotes [1] Purdue OWL ",

            "answer_text": "The first step is to read about and understand a topic. If you were an undergrad and you asked a professor for a research problem, he'd throw some papers and books at you and tell you to get lost for 2 weeks (or a month, or a semester, or a year). So if you wanted to go about doing it yourself, you'll want to pick your problems wisely since you don't want to bite off more than you can chew, especially if you have no guidance from someone who has done it all before. Thinking about it now, it will probably be difficult for most to do research completely on your own. It will probably take you much longer than it would if you had some guidance. The upshot to it is that your understanding is yours alone, and if you don't understand something then you should be working as hard as you can to alleviate that. And that work is what might make you better than peers who had advisors that helped them a lot. Not that one is better than another, or anything like that. Different strokes you know. If I were you, I'd try to contact some professors around your area, or failing that, just some professors or researchers anywhere. Ask them about their problem, maybe visit them and have a chat, and ask if there is a small project that you could work on. Researchers always have a million ideas, but they don't have the time to figure out which ones suck. They will probably be happy to have some free labor, and you'll gain your experience and maybe a recommendation letter too. There are some things you can do that are not really, truly considered core research, but would help you when you are doing research and would be good to know. For example, contributing to the Scientific Python project or an open-source CFD or astrophysics code would help you to understand how people write these codes and how to make your own contribution. Maybe there is a method not yet implemented in SciPy, or there is a newer algorithm that makes some operation faster. You can get the publication about it and translate it into fast Python code and contribute it. That's a really cool and easy way to understand research better. Most of research is just reading and understanding, so if you can read a paper and then do some real things with it and show that it works, that is making progress. It might be easier to suggest more specific topics if you mentioned what your interests are. CS is pretty broad. ",

            "answer_text": "Step 1: Know what you\u2019re talking about. Make sure that you have read extensively on a topic. Make sure that you are comfortable with all the basic concepts related to your topic of interest. Most people do this by going to school or by working in the area. Either of these methods ensure that you can get to know which resources are trustworthy, and you get a network of people with relevant experience to leverage. If you have not done either of these things, it\u2019s going to make it much more likely that you will be taken in by poorly researched, or invalidated by experience, publications. This can waste your time, and if you try to build on some of this bad data, may damage your reputation with publishers. I highly recommend that if you do not have formal education in the topic or do not work in the area, find respected subject matter experts to discuss your ideas with long before ever writing a paper. In addition to helping you avoid common misconceptions, this method can also help you gain acceptance as a serious researcher. Step 2: Be able to access or purchase necessary equipment. In addition to simply needing to have enough time to pursue your independent research while still being able to make sufficient money to eat, you will also need to be able to access the appropriate equipment. Depending on the type of research you are doing, this equipment can be quite expensive. The research and development firm where I work has over $30 million worth of equipment which I can access. Although much of this equipment is for use in areas I don\u2019t work with, I regularly use around $3 million worth, including a CT scanner, a laser, servo controlled ultrasonic and spin welders, and very high quality microscopes. It would be really difficult (or impossible) to do the same quality of research if I had to be self funded. If your topic of interest doesn\u2019t require expensive equipment, that\u2019s helpful. You might think about if you can get a wealthy philanthropist or investor to help you with equipment. But, in that case, you have to consider why they should fund you, what do you bring to the table that other, more established researchers, don\u2019t? Step 3: Do good research Obviously, right? Make sure your research is novel and very well documented. Documentation and detail are critical! Write down everything you do, even if you think it can\u2019t possibly be important. Believe me, things I did not think were important, but documented anyway, have saved me many times when going back later to do follow up work. Also, be sure that you are not duplicating work that has been done before. It\u2019s very important to do a really thorough literature search before getting started. Spend lots of time reading and taking notes, and make sure you understand what you read so you can apply it or reference it later. Step 4: Publish Now, the big payoff, getting published. Every journal will have unique formatting requirements and topic areas. While doing your literature review you should have gained a good idea of which journals would be best to approach with your new work. Write up your research in your chosen journals format. Get someone, anyone really, to read it over and check for poor word choice, poor grammar, or other glaring errors that you, as the author, will tend to glaze over. If you have developed a relationship with another researcher in the area, get them to review it. Then submit! Every journal will try to get you sign off some specific copy right agreement. Make sure to read and understand what you are agreeing to. My company has a group of librarians on staff who review these agreements and tell us whether we should sign or not. You\u2019ll just have you. Do your best. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "To a certain extent, WHY you are doing the research project often determines the the methodology of your research. If your research project is based on your own curiosity, the first step MAY be gathering and collating data. IF you research project is for either a term paper, even a short essay, or master's thesis or a Ph.D. dissertation, the first step is t library research  BEFORE you write the proposal for your thesis or dissertation.  First step for writing a term paper or research paper is to make an outline. if you keep editing the outline as you start writing the paper, that's fine, but at some point you decide to stop doing the literature search  and actually start writing.  I wrote half of my master's thesis longhand while i was technically snow bound for 3 days in the middle of February by 9 inches of snow. Classes had been cancelled. i was fortunate.  I was the last graduate student my thesis adviser advised. I knew i wanted to do remote sensing based master's thesis, had even gotten a third bachelor's degree in geography because geography department did the remote sensing research and taught the remote sensing and aerial photography courses..  My thesis adviser was willing to advise as long as my study area was  the same as the area he is an recognized expert in.  I had no problems with that. The study area was one I could go to   in a reasonable amount of time and come back \"home.\" in the same day.Because i am somewhat physically handicapped, my field truthing  was minimal.  Independent research is often based in curiosity, a question that YOU have and want to explore just because you are curious. How you organize your research, ESPECIALLY if your research NEEDS FUNDING, often dictates HOW you organize your research. My master's thesis did require  a work station. Fortunately my adviser  did have funding source so he could buy the Sun work station, which was later donated by him to school /department. as a server computer. Talk to your thesis or dissertation adviser, because USUALLY  a thesis or dissertation supports the  the adviser's research. Very few graduate students get to pick what kind of thesis  they want to do and find a faculty member who is willing to advise and sponsor them like i was able to. Yes,I DO have a personal research project that's usually on the \"back burner\" because it is in the data compilation stage. Yes, I HAVE discussed this with master's thesis adviser. I know I CANNOT afford the publication costs in a peer reviewed journal. Yes I did post some independent research as blog on the Digital Journal  in April 2008 because Katrina research. I wanted to figure out, again, because of natural curiosity, WHY my New orleans house DID NOT  FLOOD from the street when half or more of south Shore jefferson parish DID flood because of the Storm surge from Lake Pontchartrain and the open to air canals going over their banks. Other than that, my publications are three abstracts co-authored  with my thesis adviser.  in Geological Society of America abstracts. I'm not counting my master's thesis OR my  history honors thesis, even though both are bound  and in the Tulane  and University of Oklahoma library systems. I ENJOY doing library research. VERY few people enjoy doing library research, but i grew u[p reading Science, Scientific American and Time as bathroom reading material because i was a faculty dependent. ",

These days most drug companies try to work with known mechanisms or do biochemical research first, and then try to design the drug to fit to the feature they want to change.Like you want to activate this specific receptor in the membrane:  So we figure out how the receptor works. Then we find the molecules that usually activates it. We then figure out how to make a more stable molecule that has the same activation site that fits with the receptor, but we also design it so we can administer the molecule as a drug. That means the designed molecule should both be stable, preferably water soluble, have the right activation site, mostly non-toxic and the body needs to be able to remove the molecule again.Alternatively we go out in the nature and find what plants, fungus and interesting animals synthesize to help themselves.But again we need a lot of work to find the molecules, figure out how they work and see if we can synthesize it ourselves, or need the organism to make it for us.Some of the best antibiotics are still grown by fungus, because it is too complicated to manufacture that molecule.  It is fun work, but I recommend at least a bachelor degree to be able to understand just some of the processes.And the equipment needed is expensive, so you should get a job in a laboratory to get access to the needed stuff. Remember to expect at least 5-8 years of work before you have any usable result. A test or procedure goes wrong half the time when you are experimenting or testing. And then you have to redo the work as you optimize your project... sigh... this is why I didn't want a Ph.D.... ",

            "answer_text": "Basically, you would do up a research design. This would depend on the kind of research you want to conduct. Are you simply analyzing empirical research, reproducing an experiment or designing a new experiment? If you require a controlled study or a lab, you have those costs to factor in and time. You can outsource by contracting with a facility and you can hire a statistical service to help compile your data. What you'd need are the supervisors that can endorse your work and they are difficult to solicit as an independent researcher. Most researchers are already totally absorbed in their own projects. You coud talk to directors at your local university, however, and bring in your proposal to see if anyone \"bites\" but you have to have the feasibility study and projected budget done, plus a framework for the research and at least a cursory literature review. You also want to identify a legitimate publication ahead of time so you can publish your findings. Sometimes, if you've discovered significant preliminary findings on your own, you can submit your report to a funding ageny or institution and see if they will grant you funds and resources for additional research, which will only happen if your methodology is sound and your conclusions and observations can be verified. That's the idealistic scenario. If you go completely indie with it, you have to continuously cros-reference all your data yourself. If you have the passion and commitment and the time and resources, you could go solo and just publish and present. ",

            "answer_text": "All you really need is an email address, as long as you have the knowledge necessary to write a good paper and access to the scientific literature you need to put it into context. Just check the submission guidelines of the journal to which you want to submit the paper for details of how (and for details of what sort of papers they accept). Usually, the paper needs to be in a specified format and you can upload it through a web form. If you have never written a research paper before and are not working with someone with more experience, it is going to be very difficult to write a good paper. The leading journals accept only a few percent of the papers submitted, and even the middling journals accept less than half, though most of the submissions come from professional academics. So don't be disheartened if your paper is rejected - you will be in good company - and if it comes back with a lot of horrible criticisms and a request for \"major revision\", rejoice! That means the editor and reviewers are seriously considering your paper, if you make the changes they are asking for. ",

Here is the thing scientific research involves few phases: 1) identify a problem 2) specify a theory that could explain this problem 3) devise an experiment that demonstrate (or invalidate) the solidity of the theory 4) describe the theory and results so your work can be evaluated by your peers  You see the point 4 is an important one. You need to explain and demonstrate  your theory to people that have enough knowledge to evaluate its work and either use it to further the research of your community or identify what you did wrong (no hard feelings it is is easy to miss some details). And this last point is as necessary as the 3 previous ones. Do note also that your problem and theory are also a consequence of what others did (you need to know if this problem was already addressed and how you theory improves previous ones) So you never really do research on your own: you are part of community and if you are not then, to me at least, you are not doing research but playing around in your little sandbox with nobody to tell you when you do something wrong.

Based on just that, and for the lack of any other information, I\u2019ll suggest some general things you can start with. Perform meta-analyses. A lot of medical doctors publish meta-analysis research papers, which involves systematic collection and quantification of medical information, either from medical records or previously published research, and integrating it all to derive conclusions that can affect clinical procedures and practices. If done well can be published in very high-impact journals. Perhaps this is something you can adapt to your situation as well?Write a critical review of the literature already published. You can start by reading good journals in your field, and perhaps formulate an idea for a good review article, concerning the latest advances.Read journal articles to see how other physiotherapists formulate an idea and what kind of resources they need to publish. Perhaps you can adapt some of those to your practice or the cases you come across. Reading more may help you find a gap in literature, a question that you can design a study around.If you work in a hospital or a university, find senior fellows who you can associate with and assist them in their projects.Good luck!

In the social sciences and humanities, in particular, there are often different philosophical paradigms that dominate particular journals, and you need to notice where the journal stands in that sense. So see if people have written on your specialty topic previously in the journal, and if the general philosophical and methodological orientation of the journal matches yours.   Particularly valuable: Check whether your own article's references are also published or referenced in the journal.  Chances are, some of those people will be reviewing your article for the journal.  Have you cited all the relevant people in the field whose work relates to yours?  If you were a reviewer for them, how would you feel if they failed to cite your work? ",

There have been free archives where researchers can post their articles since the early nineties (see arXiv) and now some of these archives also offer open, community-based peer review (see sjscience.org). Commercial journals still exist for the prestige that goes associated with their brand, which helps in career advancement and funding.

Still, most journal editors will be surprised if you don't have a PhD and are not affiliated with any research institution or university. They will ask themselves: who's that guy? And will probably reject your paper without even sending for peer review. So, try to get an affiliation. And I of course assume you have the skills to do research, time to do it, and have some other source of income to sustain your living. ",

Beware that the system can be prejudiced against you too.  You will see that all the papers in Personality and Individual Differences have the important indexing in PubMed, with the sole exception of my own 2015 effort, despite it having gone through the \"peer review\" like all the others.  This is just due to a PubMed policy that they will index only those papers which were pre-supported by institutional grants, nothing to do with merit given that there is the \"peer review\" anyway. I don't know anything about computer \"science\" field so won't reply to your other question. ",

For example, are you a chemist who is currently working in the pharmaceutical industry, but, you are unsure about how to conduct research trials? Or, are you currently involved in designing and conducting medical research and now want to become more involved in clinical pharmacology? To be honest, it will be difficult to switch from your current area of expertise to a field that is largely unrelated but don't let anyone tell you it's impossible. It may require that you complete another PhD - I'm assuming you have one already - but that would be the price of becoming your own drug laboratory and clinical trial centre. ",

            "answer_text": "The first thing to do is to identify some questions in economics that interest you. Then star reading what has been done in to address this issue. At this point you can start to formulate a question to answer. Economists tend to rely on math, statistics and/or data as part of their research. Without these tools, it will be difficult. However, you can do some rsearch based on interviews. My high school students use  the COBWEB software, which is fee,ly available through the University Research Experience in Complex Systems)to simulate retail clusters and the impact of transportation costs on land use/density.  To conclude,mint is possible to begin research in economics but you do need to put in some time to get started. It is possible to proceed without a mentor, but it will be more difficult. ",

When I got the referee\u2019s comments back I showed them to my PhD supervisor and he helped me revise it and it got accepted. I published 5 papers single authored out of my PhD and 5 with my supervisor where he was second author. I published a paper with my fear-less leader this year. He is still sharp. On my Research Gate website I have a Masters course which I taught on \u201cHow to Publish papers in International Journals\u201d. You might find it of value. Beware of predatory academics such as Prof Insectivorous Bullfrog who live off exploiting naive students who think they must have a coauthor to publish.  ",

The first thing to do is to improve upon the topic by taking a literature survey which is nothing but a collection of articles which you use for reference. These articles or similar research papers are the reference column that you put at the back of your paper. The next process is developing the idea by experimenting and validating it. If you are in CS and if you have made a new phenomenal code , then test the code and if it gives results then that's proper validation. The final step is Writing the paper itself which you can turn to your professor to. Good luck :) ",

Research, study and understand your topic very well, know its requirements, sources, hurdles, plan, write down, make every note regarding it as you only make mistake and you only can solve it. Be prepared to solve accordingly. The single most important thing to become an independent researcher is Funding depending upon countries. For that would suggest to start small and take calculated risk. To publish, start writing review articles at beginning of your research itself through which you can know deeper in your topic of interest and your one paper will be ready for publication. Bring your article to a quality and start from high impact factors journals to communicate, learn and keep improving from rejections. ",
