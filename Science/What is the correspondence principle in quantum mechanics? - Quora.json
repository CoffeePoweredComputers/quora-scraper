            "answer_text": "The correspondence principle states that the any model describing the behavior of quantum systems must yield the same results as classical physics in the macroscopic limit.  This principle prevents quantum physicists from using models which contradict results we know are true when we examine macroscopic systems. It helps us test whether a model for quantum systems is correct. Here is an example of the correspondence principle in action: We know from quantum mechanics that matter can exhibit wavelike properties. The De Broglie relation tells us if we have a particle with a momentum, , the wavelength of the propagating matter wave is given by  where  is Planck's constant. In macroscopic systems, the magnitude of the momentum of particles is very large compared to . So therefore the wavelength of the particles in macroscopic systems is zero, and we see no wavelike interference. This is why in your day-to-day life you do not observe quantum interference. ",

            "answer_text": "The correspondence principal was created by Niels Bohr by means of a simplistic obersevation using the coulomb potential as his starting point. It means in highly excited energy states where the energy states between quantum states is so small, it resembles the continuim of states, predicted by Newtonian Physics. It however does not hold to be true under these folowing listed circumstances: As shown by a paper in Nov 22, PRL - not all high energy states are classical.2. Does not apply to some of the most commonly studied atomic force laws - like van der waals interaction. 3. Does not apply in most cases of ultra cold atoms with extremely longer-wave lengths. Since modern Quantum Field Theory for the advancement of Quantum Computing and the experimentation in area's like retro-caustion and etc\u2026 require either ultra-cold atoms or a variance in the correspondence principal for their results, it is good Bohr was not completely correct. CP may work great for hydrogen atoms, but we are not in such primitive area's with our advancements now. ",
