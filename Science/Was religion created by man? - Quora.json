            "answer_text": "All religion is literally man made. Who wrote the books ? Every scripture was written by a man. Who built the churches ? Everything ever declared about god is based on heresay on someone else\u2019s account, and zero people can prove the existence of god today. The only evidence is the reference to what someone else said, or the selective interpretation of seeing an image in a cloud formation or a piece of toast. It is not without irony that the more we increase technological knowledge, the harder it becomes to prove that god exists. You would think it would be the other way around. Newton set out to study physics as a means to prove the existence of god. The more he studied the natural world objectively, the more he found there were explanations for why things happened that had nothing to do with any god\u2019s intervention. God is reportedly capable of hearing everyone\u2019s prayers independently, and yet is only capable of communicating to select individuals, and needs them to spread his word for him. If God was truly capable of communicating directly to any one individual, then he would be capable of communicating to all individuals. There would be no need for bibles or churches. Any baby born today would never know anything about any religion if no one ever mentioned it. In order for religion to survive, people need to teach it to one another. Every baby is born with a complete absence of religion. Every baby is technically born an atheist. This is why in order to become an atheist you simply need to let go of religion. You are actually reverting back to the state in which you first entered this world. But man needs for there to be rules in religion he created, and a structure to enforce them with \u2018shepherds\u2019\u2026..not unlike a prison, for the mind. There was no religion in the dawn of human beings. Religion occurred innocently and organically as a means to explain the unexplainable. The basic fundamental human survival instinct depends on being able to classify one\u2019s immediate environment: is it safe or dangerous ? Is it something I can eat ? Is it a tool I can use ? Religion provided a handy way to fill the gap for unknowns. Along the way, man discovered that religion itself could be used as a tool. Religion is actually just a phase of our evolution. One day, if the human race still exists, if religion hasn\u2019t driven us to annihilate ourselves, then we will look back at how ignorant we once were when we blindly followed rules written in some book that were written by a select few among us, based on their interpretations of cloud formations and natural geographical and geological forces.

            "answer_text": "Since the beginning of times there have been questions that people have sought answers for. These questions range from how humans were made to what will happen in 10 years. This curiosity has led humans to creating numerous possible answers about any topic that crosses their mind. One of the sources of these answers is the idea of religion. Religion is a complicated factor in the lives of people, but in reality religion is a manmade concept. Looking at any religious piece, one will find numerous controversial and inconsistent statements. However, there are already numerous articles that thoroughly explain these points. If one were to look at the most undiscussed argument that could be used to show that the construction of religion was by man, it would be the personality of god. In numerous religions, God displays disappointment, anger, regret, happiness, and numerous other human emotions. How is it possible for an all powerful enlightened being to display human characteristics and still be labeled as the deity it is supposed to be? The attributes given to God, a divine deity, are  similar to those possessed by his imperfect creation, humans. It can be concluded that God\u2019s attributes are a reflection of his creators and a direct representation of how man perceives themselves. Furthermore, the male father figure traits given to God show that God was designed around the male father figure. Religion being manmade does not disprove the fact that the bible and other religious texts were constructed 100\u2019s of years ago. Archeologist have found evidence to show that the first handwritten bible was produced in around 1380. Over the years the bible has been re-written and translated into numerous other languages. However, its followers still believe in the usefulness of it when there are clearly outdated principles. While God is a reflection of man, the bible is a reflection of the time when it was originally written. Due to that time period, there are numerous principles stated in the bible that would seem absurd if they were ever brought up in modern times. The main examples of this are found in bible verses that could be labeled as sexist. For example, In Timothy 2:11 it is said; \u201cI permit no woman to teach or have authority of man.\u201d This verse is clearly a reflection of the time when the bible was written. A time when women were below man and were seen as nothing more than an object of sex. In 1380, for it to believed that a woman has no right to teach a man is extremely logical. This leads to bible verses such as that of Timothy 2:11 to be seen as controversial in the equality striving world we live in. Yet logical to the sexist, racist world that was around when the bible was being constructed. In conclusion, religion being created by man is not an idea that most lead to pure chaos and self doubt. Instead it should bring questions as to how the human nature truly is. Why do humans constantly need answers? Why do humans fear not having answers to the point where they must create answers? The system of religions have been around for centuries. It is possible that as time goes on the same way the beliefs of the Greek became labeled as myths eventually the same will occur to Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and so forth. However, when or if this happens, how will it be handled? With man\u2019s source of answers being lost, will humans fall into complete anarchy, or will they start to see how the beings they have worshipped for so long are merely reflections of themselves?
