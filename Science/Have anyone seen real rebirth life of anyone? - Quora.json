            "answer_text": "Rebirth can never be proved, because the one who dies is never reborn. A very different person or personality is born. Obviously, rebirth is a myth. But, there is an essence, a \u201csomething\u201d that has continuity, and this \u201csame essence\u201d is present in the old individual (personality) that has died and also in the new individual (personality) who is born after the death of the earlier individual. That is, there is no period of overlap of the evolving \u201cessence\u201d during the change of the \u201cform\u201d it occupies in two different terrestrial lives. This \u201cessence\u201d is distinct in nature and distinguishable from another similar essence. In Hinduism, this essence is called Atma, and Christians call it the Soul. In Theosophy it is known by the term Ego. According to me, the essence is a distinct consciousness associated with a bundle of memories. Thus, the consciousness or the essence is reborn. This can never be proved. The essence, the consciousness, cannot be seen, tracked or measured by physical instruments. It can only be imagined, conceptualised, and simply believed (or disbelieved). [Both belief as well as disbelief in anything and not just in the question of whether rebirth is true or false, are false]. Rebirth can perhaps be proved by proxy, by analysing the memories of a few people who tend to remember a previous life. But that isn\u2019t conclusive proof or evidence. The reason is, someone reborn can also be impressed with memories of a dead person (who is still in the after-death realms) and there is no way to know whether the person is actually a case of rebirth or is it a case of impressed or precipitated thoughts of a dead person. There are people who can read the indelible records from the askasha and \u201csee\u201d how the essence has fared life after life. But, unless you yourself know to access and read akashic records first-hand, how do you know he is right and not being carried away with his own imagination? Moreover, that too is not irrefutable proof. Personally I firmly believe (know, not believe) in rebirth of the Soul or rebirth of consciousness. But, I just cant explain my insight. Yet at the same time I challenge anyone to prove it to me. I can easily prove him otherwise, and bombard him with such logical questions, he will find no answers. So matters like rebirth must not fall under the domain of belief or disbelief. Rather, it is best to come upon one\u2019s own understanding or insight about its existence or in-existence. Don\u2019t just believe in it; rather understand it. Once understood, don\u2019t go around telling others or proving it to others. That\u2019s foolish! ",

            "answer_text": "Is there a scientific basis for reincarnation? Indian forensic scientist Vikram Raj Singh Chauhan is trying to prove reincarnation is real. He has presented his findings at the National Conference of Forensic Scientists in India. Chauhan has discovered a six-year-old boy named Taranjijt Singh who says he remembers his previous life. According to his parents, he\u2019s been talking about this since he was two years old and used to run away from home. The boy knew the village he lived in during his former life, as well as his and his father\u2019s names. He knew the name of the school he attended as well. On September 10, 1992, he was riding his bike home when he was hit by a motor scooter. He received head injuries and died the next day. His present father, Ranjit Singh, says as the boy became more and more insistent, so he and his wife went to the village where he claimed to have lived in the past. At first, they couldn\u2019t find anyone who resembled the descriptions of his former parents. Then someone told him to go to another nearby village, where they met a teacher at the local school who confirmed the story of the motor scooter accident. They found out where the boy had lived and went there to meet the parents. When they told the family their story, Ranjit Singh mentioned that his son claimed the books he was carrying when the accident occurred had gotten blood on them. He also described how much money he had in his wallet. When the woman heard this, she began to cry and said she had saved the blood-stain books and the money in memory of her dead child. Taranjit Singh\u2019s parents and siblings from his former life soon came to his new home to meet him. The boy recognized a wedding picture his former parents brought with him. At first, Vikram Chauhan refused to believe this story but he eventually became curious and decided to investigate. He visited both villages and found the boy and both sets of parents repeated the same story. He spoke to a shopkeeper who told him that the boy had owed him the money that was in his wallet when he was hit, and was probably bringing it to him to pay for a notebook he\u2019d gotten on credit. Chauhan took samples of both boys\u2019 handwriting and compared them. He found they were identical. It\u2019s a basic tenet of forensic science that no two handwriting styles can be identical, because each person\u2019s handwriting has specific characteristics. Experts can usually spot even expertly forged handwriting. A person\u2019s handwriting style is dictated by individual personality traits. Chauhan\u2019s theory is that if the soul is transferred from one person to another, then the mind \u2013 and thus the handwriting \u2013 will remain the same. A number of other forensic experts examined the handwriting samples and agreed they were identical. \u201cI have some scientific basis to claim rebirth is possible\u201d, says Chauhan, \u201cbut I wish to do more research on the subject and am closely monitoring the development of the child.\u201d Singh\u2019s former parents wanted him to move back with them, but his current family still claims him, even though they are poor. Chauhan says, \u201cIn his present birth, Taranjit has never gone to school as he belongs to a poor family, but yet when I told him to write the English and Punjabi alphabet, he wrote them correctly.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Haven't seen a real rebirth per se. But I did come across a real life story of a 3 year old boy from the Golan Heights region near Syria & Israel Border. The boy belonged to Druze ethnic group, a group who culturally accepts reincarnation as a fact. De facto the elders encourage & push the infants to remember or try to recollect past life memories.  The story goes that the boy had a red mark on the forehead since birth. Like many other cultures, the Druze believe birth marks are related to past life deaths. When the boy turned 3 years old, he began revealing facts from his past life. He remembered his past life name, the family & village he belonged to, and that the birth mark on the forehead came from the blow of the axe that killed him.  The boy was taken to the village, the house & the family belonged to the same name the boy revealed his past life name to be. The elders got to know that the previous life person had gone missing four years earlier. The boy later continued to reveal his past life murderer's name. Upon reaching the house the boy identified the murderer who denied the accusation upon confrontation. The boy said he could take the elders to the place where the body was buried. They supposedly found a skeleton buried with a wound on the head where the boy had a birthmark. They also found buried the axe used as the murder weapon. Faced with evidence the murderer admitted his crime.  Follow Jatin Chheda on Quora for more.   ",

The so-called \u201cBardo\u201d between lives is likewise a concept, a designation like \u201cheaven\u201d, that of itself IS the conceptualizing \u201cI\u201d, the ego, which only has the thinking mind to call \u201cmine\u201d. Even intuition threaten\u2019s ego\u2019s artifice of autonomy. Only love\u2019s wisdom can replace the \u201cI\u201d. Knowing the difference between conditioned mind and unconditional awareness is something that should be taught to 5 year old kids, who are more than able to spontaneously recognize the acquired content of their minds, from the natural clarity of their present awareness. As to what happens \u201cin transition / between lives\u201d, let me assure you that your comfort and safety are complete and undeniable, so much so, you never give it another thought. What appears depends of how unwilling you are to let go of your past and self-image. Trust me, let go of it all, and let go of what appears in the Bardo! Focus on awareness free of any image or content, other than how good it feels, and that you always know what you see, is your reflection. You can TOTALLY relax. The more you can, holding nothing but the gentle joy of here and now, the more you know that ALL you see and feel, is light and energy you yourself are shining. This is why it is such an advantage to recognize while in human form, before death comes, so you will be prepared and unsurprised by what unfolds before your eternal eyes\u2026 It is the same as what happens when one\u2019s unconditioned awareness unmistakably sees itself. In that instant of naked self-recognition, the automatic process of taking form is set in motion. Yes, it\u2019s automatic and entirely the natural unfolding of empty presence into self-aware beings, just as we are\u2026 No one returns, no one is reborn. This is it right now, whether or not you have a body. This spontaneous, naked insight equally and completely resolves ALL misperceptions, whether in \u201cbirth\u201d, \u201cdeath\u201d or eternal life. The whole point is the changeless, causeless, undivided presence you always are this instant. That you are, means nothing, outside the remarkable certainty known in the complete surrender of belief in self. Wisdom and enthusiastic curiosity aren\u2019t knowledge. Your heart easily knows what\u2019s being pointed to, right now. Question the authority of ego, stay here, where the sufferer is no more. ",

            "answer_text": "Rebirth is an accepted fact in higher spiritual circles. In India, more so. In fact, all religions emanating from India believe in it - be it Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, or Sikhism. Proving rebirth, is tough. Of late, many studies have been scientifically conducted about this subject. One may check those out. Often on the TV, here in India, live screening of 5\u20136 year old kids remembering their past lives - and thereafter, going thereof, and correctly identifying his or her previous life family etc. - have been even very recently telecast. One may believe such matters thenceforth, or not. However, metaphysically speaking, a blessed seeker and devotee who is taken unto the Gnosis of What Is, does witness it, as a \u201cphysical\u201d phenomenon. In a nutshell, what happens in the phenomenon of re-birth is this: The \u201cself\u201d of the meditating being is \u201cseen\u201d to separate from one\u2019s body. In this body-less-ness state of spirit, the discerning \u201cethereal\u201d yogi then \u201clooks around\u201d, and finds that he is no longer the body. But more! In a way, it may well be understood and so said - in hindsight - that the yogi witnesses the \u201cphysical\u201d death of his body as if - though very much alive, paradoxically, in consciousness and in spirit-ness, so to say. Thence many a transcendental vision come, and go. But that is beyond the scope of the answer to the query at present. In any case, the yogi, after a transitory transcendence, self-witnesses the breath of life re-enter his body and being. And \u201ccoming back\u201d as though! From the state of \u201cnon\u201d of body-less-ness. And sees, as a virtual physicality, his human entity \u201creborn\u201d - back to what it were before this phenomenon. Therefore, to a blessed and chosen entity - by the Grace of That Which Is - the process of becoming, non-becoming, and re-coming etc. is \u201cshown\u201d as a virtual reality. As real as this writing being penned at this very moment. Summing up, it may be said a rare freemystic \u201creceives\u201d this blessing. Of witnessing by self, as to how the being is \u201ctorn\u201d from \u201cbeingness\u201d.And then, shown to be \u201csired\u201d from \u201cnothing\u201d as if.Then, \u201cdying\u201d as though. And \u201cborn again\u201d. Unto a no-thing-ness.And \u201creborn\u201d all over again. From That, which, is everything-ness.Hence, that which is self-witnessed and self-experienced, cannot be adequately and efficiently told in so many words - to someone other than the self. Either one can believe it, or one may seek and find by one\u2019s own-self. Most shall not. However, you may. Who knows! ~_~ ",

            "answer_text": "Rebirth is understood as a same person born again after death.  That is not Rebirth. To me Rebirth means a Renewed Man.  I was filled with all the wrong notions about life and death. I was wandering aimlessly. I kept thinking about past and future. Then I came across the teachings of many great masters like Gautama Buddha, Acharya S. N. Goenka,  Osho, Dr.  Ambedkar, Voltaire, etc etc. I met multiple enlightened men through books and discourses. I even travelled to distant places and understood that Nature is also a great teacher.  I lost anger, hatred, jealousy, possesiveness, laziness, and other vices and desires. I am living in the present in toto. Everyday when I wake up in the morning I feel I am reborn. I revel in the beauty of nature and enjoy every second of my existence.  Nobody can prove rebirth. One can only experience rebirth. ",

Though I have heard stories where a person knows what happened in their past life while living in their present life. However there isn\u2019t any evidence. Hardly there even can be a proof because not everyone sees things with the same eyes as that person with reincarnation must have. ",
