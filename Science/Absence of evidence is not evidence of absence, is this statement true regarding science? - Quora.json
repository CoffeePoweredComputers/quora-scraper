            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, To me this is about confidence levels. In statistics, a confidence level is a determination of how strongly you can be convinced of a general principal.  Random things do happen, including such random events as a fair coin landing on heads every single time for 20 straight throws. As unlikely as that seems, if all 300 million people in the US flip a coin 20 times, probably 300 of them will get that one in a million event. So you learn that the truth is sometimes hidden behind random events. If you flip a coin 20 times and it comes up heads 20 times, you can be forgiven for thinking it's a 2 headed coin or a rigged coin because the one in a million chance that this 20 heads happened randomly is a pretty rare chance. But here's the thing. Scientists know to keep flipping the coin and looking. They also always do their best to look at both sides of the coin, if possible, to weigh the coin, spin the coin, keep looking. One of the hardest things for the non-scientifically aware public to understand is the language of science. It goes far deeper than \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.\" Even the presence of evidence (as in the coin example) is not conclusive evidence of presence. Everything is couched in confidence level terms. There's sort of an accepted confidence level when scientists begin taking things seriously, and that at the 98% mark. That corresponds roughly to getting heads 7 times in a row. That's about the point you start saying, \"I think we've got a 2 headed coin here.\" But you always print the confidence level, \"I think we've got a 2 headed coin here with about a 98% confidence level.\" The general public has an entirely different way of talking because they seem to only know, \"Yes, it's certain,\" or, \"no it's wrong.\" Science gets picked on for lacking nuance, but science is nuanced in ways far more useful than the public's meaning of nuance. Science can put numbers on the results of data and continue to refine those numbers over time. Instead of saying, \"We absolutely positively have a 2 headed coin,\" they'll say, \"We've got a 99.99% confidence level\" (or more often in 0 to 1 parlance, we have a .9999 confidence level) \"that we've got a 2 headed coin\" So lets say you pick the coin up and see heads on one side. Then you turn it over and you see heads on the other side. Do you still know it's a 2 headed coin? Maybe you slipped when you turned it over. Maybe a guy trained in coin manipulation magic switched the coin so expertly  you didn't even notice. So one of the things about science is that everything remains negotiable.  But there's a different side of this confidence level thing, a side the public doesn't get at all. There has to be some efficacy. Think of the \"lack of evidence\" in the context of clinical trials. Here is a situation that happens all the time. New drugs are tested, go into clinical trials. In the lab they passed the 98% confidence level, so they go forward. Then what happens? A lot of the time the coin suddenly starts coming up tails, coming up tails half the time it's tossed, something that didn't happen once in the lab starts happening as expected in the field. We can call that absence of evidence, or we could call it evidence of absence. Whatever you want to call it, when it happens the drug doesn't get approved. And it doesn't get approved not because it has been proven without a doubt that the drug has no beneficial effects, but because no one could show any evidence of beneficial effects. So in that sense, absence of evidence is taken as evidence of absence. This works the other way too. Take the charge that GMOs are dangerous, or that living near power lines increases the risk of leukemia. Here too studies are done looking for some non-chance level of results. Study after study comes back with heads and tails both at 50%. Once again absence of evidence is used by scientists to say that this is evidence of absence, that there is no bad effect. The public loves to key in on the words, \"Inconclusive\" as if they are the most damning words that can be said about a trial. But there are only 2 kinds of results. Conclusive and inconclusive. What does it take to get conclusive results? It takes a level of occurrences so outside of chance as to be highly unlikely. What does it take to get inconclusive results? It just takes results that look like chance. So you flip a coin 20 times, get 11 heads and 9 tails, that would be inconclusive. If you flip it 2000 times and get 1100 heads and 900 tails that would not be inconclusive because it would be well outside of chance expectations. Inconclusive is the norm, not the exception. \"Inconclusive\" is generally what you expect to see whenever the effect is so small as to be immaterial. \"Inconclusive,\" really means that the effects are so small that they are indistinguishable from what you'd expect to see if there was no effect at all. And yet people routinely want to jump all over progress to chase down these inconclusive results further, hoping that if they flip a coin often enough they'll get a run with which they can see, \"See, there is an effect.\" The way I look at any claim is to see if it would pass FDA approval. Would the claim allow the medication to be marketed to the public? The FDA sets a pretty high barrier. There are not too many people (I happen to be one of them, but I'm in the tiny minority) who think we should stop this FDA approval process and just try things and see what happens. There are not too many people who say, \"Well, if there is no evidence of efficacy, we should still let the drug pass.\" But for the general public, if it is something they care about they are quick to say that absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, quick to find any way they can to get their point heard, quick to chastise scientists for their numbers and statistics.  But absence of evidence, in a world with scanning tunneling microscope and infra-red and radio telescopes, absence of evidence is evidence of absence, and pretty strong evidence at that. ",

            "answer_text": "\"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,\" is this statement true regarding science? As with so many things it depends on context: Many like Theo Williams  mistakenly or misleadingly attribute that quote to Carl Sagan, though he was actually quoting someone else to criticize the expression, as shown in the bolded excerpt below.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence  ...Carl Sagan \"impatience with ambiguity\" with cosmologist Martin Rees' maxim, \"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\" [4]  [4] Sagan, Carl (1997). The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark (1st ed.). New York: Ballantine. p. 213. ISBN 0-345-40946-9. OCLC 32855551. Appeal to ignorance\u2014the claim that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa (e.g., There is no compelling evidence that UFOs are not visiting the Earth; therefore UFOs exist\u2014and there is intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe. Or: There may be seventy kazillion other worlds, but not one is known to have the moral advancement of the Earth, so we're still central to the Universe.) This impatience with ambiguity can be criticized in the phrase*: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. *bold/italics emphasis added, As Christphe Crop said, a better iteration of this expression is: Absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence. If your powers of observation relative to the the area of search are sufficiently great, absence of evidence is clearly evidence of absence.  For example:  you can have perfect information about the contents of your pocket.  Absence of evidence of milk in your refrigerator, is evidence of absence of milk.Plain observation can see the absence of an Elephant in a small backyard, which serves as evidence of the absence.Specifically, in science there is sometimes room for debate, depending on the details of particular experiment.  In carefully designed scientificexperiments, even null results can be evidence of absence. For instance, a hypothesis may be falsified if a vital predicted observation is not found empirically. (At this point, the underlying hypothesis may be rejected or revised and sometimes, additional ad hoc explanations may even be warranted.) Whether the scientific community will accept a null result as evidence of absence depends on many factors, including the detection power of the applied methods, and the confidence of the inference.-Wikipedia \"Absence of Evidence\" article.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A Darius, your questions are always fun!  I think so, yes.  (1) If I'm grasping this little brain teaser properly, what you're saying is:  \"A scientist is testing for the eventual breakdown of substrate S by trying to find the enzyme E. The breakdown of S results only in the formation of protein P, and the breakdown of S is the only way P can form. She can't find any E, but finds plenty of P.\"  So she can't find E, but that doesn't mean that S doesn't break down.  This makes sense because we can't find any E (absence of evidence) doesn't mean that we have evidence of absence (in this case the state of affairs in which S doesn't breakdown).   Is that what the teaser means?  (2) If it means the other thing I'm thinking of then my answer is no because absence of evidence is still evidence which means it's not evidence of absence (of evidence...although it is evidence of the state of affairs which include an absence of some sort). Here we are not equivocating with the terms absence and evidence, but you asked about scientific inquiry which I took as an invitation to delve into reasoning using causal relationships as we do with scientific inquiry...    (1a) But I'm reading you charitably (first interpretation), so here we go...  The task of science is to explain the causal relationship between certain natural (ultimately physical) phenomena. Just because we can't find a thing that Q that we thought was caused by that P doesn't mean that Q doesn't exist (especially when we have empirical observations saying  that it does). Please note that if P then Q states only a logical relationship (maybe a way to articulate an observation in this case). Science is concerned with an additional causal explanation for the presence of that Q, which we'll play around with.  Maybe we find that the observation of that P was only a necessary condition in establishing a causal explanation articulating the presence of that Q (instead of a sufficient one as we had previously thought).  Welp, time to make a new model to explain a sufficient condition (or a series of necessary conditions which altogether are sufficient) which give a causal, physical, explanatory model for the presence of that Q.  extra reading: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency That's all!

            "answer_text": "No. We as human beings experience an absence of information via all of our physical senses. Our eye sight is limited and not as good as other creatures on this planet. Our nose is also very limited as the specifically skilled among us follows trained dogs around to find stuff. Our hearing is also very limited as other animals have far superior hearing. Then there are the comparisons to bats and dolphins and their form of radar. We are absent of those abilities. I\u2019m stopping there. You get the point. The human form is weak and very limited. The above illustration is proof that the lack of or the absence of information and/or evidence does not mean that any particular thing does not exist. Is God real? Which God or god? who is God? What is God? Are their gods? Who were they? Where did they all go? That most likely cannot be proven in any physical sense as we may not have the full extinct in mental capacity to truly pose the question let alone be able to comprehend the answer. We can look to our ancient history books. For some answers or just for clues. Either way the puzzle picture made up of many kinds of clues would be interesting to see. If you want to find the God of The Holy Bible. You have to follow His rules. Prayer, intentional fasting. Reading and continually reading the book. Becoming righteous and holy as only God accepts. Oh yea and that is without pride, ego, arrogance and superiority. Love one another. EZ PZ. Yet, if you actually do those things and do have that spiritual zinger. You still would not have the physical evidence on whether or not God exists. But, to you? To me yes, The God of the Holy Bible does exist. Can I prove it. No. Well, maybe that I\u2019m sitting here typing away is proof enough for some. ",

            "answer_text": "John wrote: \"It depends on what you mean. If \"absence of evidence\" means you have no evidence at all about anything, then of course you cannot conclude anything.\" Excellent observation, John. Consider a man who lived 200 years ago.  What scientific evidence was at his disposal regarding the quantum realm?  Well, any honest person would say absolutely zero.  This is obvious.  \"absence of evidence\" means you have no  evidence at all about anything (in this case the quantum realm), then of course you cannot conclude anything. And in the context of this question, we are considering scientific evidence, not subjective evidence, but evidence arrived at by scientific inquiry. So forgetting the last hundred years, no scientific evidence existed in support of the quantum realm. Without empirical scientific evidence, no conclusions nor probabilities can be summed. This seems quite obvious, does it not? Since no evidence existed, there is an absence of evidence. Why there is a lack of scientific evidence is irrelevant. 300 years ago there existed none. It doesn't matter why. So for the better part of 14 billion years (minus 100 years), not a single human ever expected to find the quantum world, simply because it was unimaginable, exceedingly counterintuitive.  And this is an excellent example of a scenario where the statement: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Is true.  It also raises a very important question: What other scientific facts are unseen and unimaginable today? What other \"quantum realms\" are we ignorant of and have a lack of evidence for? One cannot explain that which one cannot imagine. ",

            "answer_text": "\"'Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence' -- is this statement true regarding science?\" Not really. What's true is that if you haven't searched at all for something, or if you have searched for it very little, then you can't really say it doesn't exist. However, if you do an extensive search and still don't find what you're looking for, the chances increase that it doesn't exist. Consider searching for the proverbial needle in a haystack. If you just glance at the haystack and declare \"there is no needle\" just because you haven't noticed it in one look, then that's bad science. Surely it could be hiding somewhere where it's not easy to see. Similarly, if you only search the top half of the haystack, the needle could still be hiding in the bottom half. However, if you do an extensive search through the haystack and still find nothing, that's certainly evidence of absence. While it's in principle possible that the needle was there and you just missed it, the more you search, the less likely this possibility becomes. We use this kind of reasoning all the time. For example, we are pretty certain that non-avian dinosaurs no longer exist, although we've not searched every corner of the Earth where they may be hiding. ",

We understand this when we look across a table for our keys, or look for almost anything else as long as we're being honest. I have no patience for those who will pretend to not understand this.  Our preconceived notions can blind us, and we can draw constellations and confuse invention with discovery, but we nevertheless can see things that are not expected or desired. It is not the case that an elite few are 'sensitive' or 'chosen' or 'awake' while the rest of us are blind sheeple who must trust them to report on gods or ghosts or the Illuminati to us; this narcissism is typical of the conspiracy theorist who will tell you of your flawed reasoning while ignoring the most obvious flaws in their own thought.

            "answer_text": "Ok, this one is potentially quite interesting. In the simple case we have no evidence because we haven't looked for any:  clearly absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. In the second case, we look extremely hard, preferably by numerous people, for specific evidence and fail to find evidence.  If we are careful here, we can say that based on the effort so far, we can find no evidence of the phenomenon.  It is acceptable to conclude that there is high likelihood of evidence of absence in this case (but not full certainty). Now lets consider the situation of a phenomenon  which we can demonstrate can never be detected.  An example might be other universes orthogonal to our own (there are other more interesting cases, but this seems relatively uncontroversial).  If it can never be detected, it is a reasonable question of whether it actually exists.  Remember, from a scientific perspective, everything eventually is related back to experimental evidence.  If we can conclusively show that should such a phenomenon exist it can conclusively be demonstrated that it could never be experimentally detected, then scientifically, arguably it does not exist:  it is at best a theory (and arguably an uproveable theory at that). If you pursue this carefully in the context of the scientific method, which in part depends on replication of experiments, then it opens up some very interesting questions in and of itself. ",

This is like an orphaned toddler saying he does not have a mother, simply because he has never met her. Atheism trusts only what is immediately apparent to the physical senses.

It was assumed to exist because it was assumed light required a medium to travel in just as sound waves. Well, Michelson-Morley experiment always showed no evidence for the ether, i.e., no interference was measured. This is a classic case of absence of evidence is evidence for absence. Einstein eventually showed the ether was not needed.  Another case where absence of evidence may be evidence of absence is the lack of data for predicted supersymetric particles. With the energies achieved at CERN it appears these really do not exist.  Now for the other side. The search for the Higgs particle took over 50 years to find it. In this case the abscence of evidence was not evidence of abscence.  Now for a twist on this premise, consider the neutron and electron before they were discovered. You have centuries of absence of evidence, but we know they exist. An extreme case but it's there.  Another example of abscence of evidence is people flying!

In fact it's the best possible evidence. Nothing could be a stronger indication of A's not being in X than a systematic failure to find any trace of A in X. But failing to find A in X is not in itself evidence that A is absent from location Y or location Z. Obviously these have to be examined separately. As long as there is some relevant location which has not been examined, it's possible that an A may be found there. But unless there's some reason to think that A is in one location rather than another, then failing to find A in numerous locations makes it increasingly probable that it's not anywhere. And the qualifier 'relevant' is important here. If someone is arguing, for instance, that a supernatural being exists who causes events on earth, then the relevant place to look for evidence of that being is on earth. Supernatural beings may be in abundance out beyond the orbit of Neptune, or 'outside space and time', whatever that means; but if we can't find any here on earth, then we're entitled to conclude that they don't have any relevance for us.

            "answer_text": "It is true.  However, absence of evidence can still be used as an argument (not evidence) against some hypotheses. It is usually the case when the realm the hypothesis covers is well explained by existing theories which show no \"holes\", and there is no reason to choose one of \"alternatives\" over all others. Also, scientists often evoke (granted, unscientific, strictly speaking) arguments of elegance and parsimony (\"Occam's razor\"). For example, creationism vs. science: tremendously complex web of knowledge in cosmology, physics, biology, genetics, chemistry explains our physical world quite well. Introducing God, for existence of which we have no evidence, contributes nothing to our understanding. Moreover, there are thousands of contradictory concepts of deity.  So, science does not introduce a hypothesis of deity, which does not mean that some scientists are not religious or that some don't entertain us and themselves with speculations on creation of our Universe, or us creating other universes (Sagan, Brin, Benford...). The flip side is that \"holes\" or mere inelegance in our scientific frameworks will push us to look beyond present  evidence, for a \"bigger picture\": Higgs had no particular evidence pointing to existence of (now) eponymous field and its mediating particle when he proposed them - it's just that we didn't know what causes mass, which was unsatisfactory situation. Over years scientific community became so satisfied with coherence and elegance of the theory that tens of thousands of physicists, engineers and technicians committed their careers to the effort resulting in \"We have five sigma!\" Now, we are eager for LHC to show a crack in now complete Standard Model, in order to look further. Why would we look further? We are dissatisfied with the fact that gravity is explained by a theory separate from all other forces. (To be fair, we do have astronomical evidence, in the rate of expansion of the Universe and gravitational behavior of galaxies, that something is seriously amiss in our particle inventory.) Or, take Big Bang: for decades it was one of competing hypotheses (along with Steady State and others) of the origin of our Universe.  It was only the accumulating evidence like cosmic microwave background radiation that made cosmologists decide.   Or, various Multiverse hypotheses: the main reason of their poor acceptance is that scientists feel them inelegant. ",

            "answer_text": "Is the statement \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,\" true in the context of strictly scientific evidence? I have to say that my pedantic nature bristles at the implication behind \"strictly scientific evidence\": i.e., that there could be something termed \"loosely scientific evidence\" as well! But anyway, maybe that's just me.  Then again I wonder, why would the truth of the statement vary with the \"strictness\" of the \"evidence\"? What do we mean by strictness? Perhaps correctness, or even relevance?  There could be some truth in that, yes! Anyway, evidence is broadly and simply thought of as anything presented in support or defence of a proposition. In which case, irrespective of the strictness or looseness of the absent evidence, it is self-evident that you can't demonstrate \"evidence of absence\" without any evidence at all.  LATER EDIT: This question has been edited and the context re-written. In light of that, and other comments suggesting that 'evidence' is adequately defined by what I believe are actually 'types of evidence', here's an independent definition of Evidence. END EDIT. Which means that the statement as it stands is both self-evident and true, but only by default. Evidence failed to turn up to the match, so the win goes to...  (cheering subsides). We can do better than this by simply making our statement more relevant.   LATER EDIT: The context has been edited subsequent to my original answer, so I have taken a moment to add some clarification. I have always understood that the preferred type of evidence is \"scientific\", and that remains the case, irrespective of the edited context detail: Scientific evidence arrived at by the scientific method, not subjective speculative evidence.  This new context edit doesn't add a definition for evidence, stating only that the evidence should be arrived at by the scientific method. That is, by observation, testable hypothesis and experiment. Note that this remains perfectly congruent with any reasonable definition of \"evidence\", including that which I presented earlier, being 'anything presented in support or defence of a proposition'. It was already understood that evidence derived via the scientific method is required. Nothing has changed in any meaningful sense. I will add that I understand that \"subjective\" means not objective, or dealing with opinion rather than fact. I believe that my answer remains factual, not subjective, in so much as we can be currently confident of any particular \"fact\". In science, facts are mutable, they change as our confidence shifts to accommodate newer information. I have added references to reinforce the assertion, anyway.  Further, I contend that \"speculative\" means a wide range of things, from hypothetical to conjectural; that is, based on conjecture rather than knowledge. Whilst inevitable that some conjecture will exist in any answer outside of say a mathematical proof, I recognise also that the question itself invites conjecture as part of the context: namely that the argument be based on scientific principles. Hypothesis is an integral part of the process of investigation. The question and context are internally contradictory in that sense. END EDIT.    Now applying the supplied context here we get \"absence of scientifically-determined evidence is not scientifically-determined evidence of absence\". Which is where we get all semantic I guess.  Do we mean an absence of scientifically-determined evidence because we haven't even looked for any? In which case we have no evidence at all, either for or against any proposition, be it scientific or not. This remains self-evident and to my mind a rather pointless pursuit.  What other answer do you expect if you haven't collected any evidence?   However it seems to me that as soon as you do look for evidence of any sort (using a scientific approach or not) then you have created evidence by the very process of your search, and thus you no longer have an absence of evidence. (Although the evidence could be for, neutral or against.) LATER EDIT: For clarity, let me preface this example with an explanation. The following is in a sense a Thought experiment. It is widely used in science as a way of logically exploring concepts that are challenging to conduct as a physical experiment. Whilst hypothetical, another step in the scientific method, it is not speculative in the sense of \"a guess\" or based purely on \"conjecture\"; rather each point or principle raised is based on real scientific principles and falls within scope of current knowledge. For example, manned missions to the moon have occurred and more are planned to Mars. Probes and scans currently can and do test for a range of chemical compounds, including features that are considered life-supporting, including a \"breathable atmosphere\". I simply ask that we take our real experience of space travel and apply it to the question asked. To make this thought experiment entirely and completely real, if the first manned lunar mission had believed that \"absence of evidence (for a breathable atmosphere) is not evidence of absence (for a breathable atmosphere)\", then they could have simply opened their helmets to test this proposition. Instead they used scientific principles to determine with great confidence the absence of a breathable atmosphere and take the necessary precautions. In this particular case absence of evidence clearly is evidence of absence. END EDIT.   A manned deep-space vehicle could for example approach an unknown planet with an unknown atmosphere and by careful selection of scanning techniques mount a rigorous search for, say, a breathable atmosphere.  Where previously we had no evidence, ie an absence of evidence, by the act of scanning we have created a body of scientific evidence within the scope of the scanners and their range of calibration. I'm not saying it's ultimately comprehensive and the final word on the matter, I'm just saying that we now have evidence within some bounds. It is now useful and relevant. Perhaps the on-board scanners do their job correctly as designed and report that no breathable atmosphere is detected.  Now when we consider the enhanced statement that \"absence of evidence (for a breathable atmosphere) is not evidence of absence (for a breathable atmosphere)\" we are left wondering.  If we have rigorously searched within known parameters for evidence in support of a breathable atmosphere and found no such evidence, surely that is evidence of absence of a breathable atmosphere? In which case the statement is false. Or do we instead trust the blanket statement that \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\" and step outside of our spacecraft, helmet open?  It's certainly true that the quality of any experimental methodology and the resultant evidence itself will vary but it's in the nature of scientific enquiry to keep looking, to find other, perhaps better ways to test a hypothesis and collect superior evidence.  This is simply the Scientific method at work, at least as many understand and define it today.  And then we get all semantic. If we do apply the scientific method to a proposition, a hypothesis, run experiments and collect evidence, then we cannot then have \"absence of evidence\" in that strictest sense.  Absence of evidence (in this context) must surely mean that the scientific method has not been applied, and therefore it is self-evident that this lack of enquiry cannot be construed as \"evidence of absence\". It fails any reasonable relevance test.  However you could be implying \"evidence for a proposition\", as in \"absence of evidence for a proposition is not evidence of absence (for that proposition)\" of course. Which of course is also self-evident in the sense that you may not have searched in the right place or your experimental methodology was poor. To avoid this semantic quagmire simply apply the scientific method to any of the \"big questions of science\" you may have, be it cosmology or not. If you have observed an unexplained discrepancy in the standard model of cosmology, say, and collected and shared evidence of it, you may choose to label it \"dark matter\", for example. It then is up to you and others alike to set about composing hypotheses and designing experiments to test these propositions. This is the scientific method. Each validly conducted test (we do have standards here, after all) and its results will test a hypothesis and produce a result for or against, or somewhere in between. By the independent repetition of such experiments we gain or lose confidence in a proposition.  It may be that we don't find an answer to our question, if only because we don't have the ideas or tools to probe the right area or whatever; but it is self-evident that this doesn't mean our proposition is wrong, just that we may be justified in losing confidence in it. On the other hand if we get confirming evidence, our confidence rises. It still isn't \"proof\" in that \"mathematical\" sense, it simply represents a growing body of evidence in support of a proposition.  All of the topics raised, i.e. \"Cosmology, Singularity of the Big Bang, Black holes... (and)... Dark energy\" and many more are investigated in this way, using the scientific method and individual solutions explored and developed. Our confidence in any of these solutions will vary over time.  FWIW this is very similar in scope to The quantum world was unknown and unimaginable for nearly 150,000 years. Does this prove that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence? and my answer still applies.  Further reading Cosmological Models  Lambda-CDM model  Scientific method    ",

It is purely probability of existence at that point. Probability that God exists - 50% Probability that God doesn\u2019t exist - 50% So for all practical purposes, Science only considers things which do have evidence and its worked out pretty fine so far in the human history. The same applies to God as well, since it is another hypothesis put across by Human Beings. When evidence does show up, we can visit the probabilities again because it won\u2019t be the same for sure. So yes, the statement holds true! ",

BUTIf you look into inductive reasoning, the probability of presence lowers the more (relevant) information you have. For example: If I go to a sandbox and start looking for money (that may or may not be in there), finding no coins after two hours of searching will be \"evidence\" that there are few or no coins present in the sandbox. The likelihood of coins and likelihood of many coins drops.This does not mean that there are absolutely none, but it is \"evidence\" Only if I have completely searched the whole sandbox (by sifting every grain and inspecting the bottom when emptied), I can conclude there are no coins. But such absolute proofs of absence are vary rare in reality.  Same goes for Russel's teapot: There might be a teapot, but the likelihood is very low (well, not that we literally searched, we base our guess on the fact that there is no intelligence in that part of space that could have made and put/discarded a teapot there). But on a whole, en surely in deductive logic, one can not conclusively (completely) conclude that absence of evidence is evidence of absence. (one may have not even looked at certain information or has no evidence what-so-ever...) ",

Evidence by its nature is a positive indicator: it is an effect that we see that conforms to a particular theoretical expectation. Sometimes an absence can be a positive effect - for instance, if we normally expect to see effect X and it does not occur - but we cannot extend that to the idea of a negative indicator (a meaningful non-effect).  This is really an issue of the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis refers to what we expect to see if nothing particularly interesting is happening. If something new, different, or unexpected happens, then we have evidence of something. It is evidence because something other then what normally happens happened; there is a measurable difference in outcomes. But if nothing out of the ordinary happens, there is no measurable difference in outcomes, and that tells us nothing new about the world. ",
