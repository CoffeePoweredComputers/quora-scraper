I pretty much never am talking to friends on the phone. That said I am the same with texting as well. Most of my talking to people is on FB messenger which a lot of the time I use my phone to do. I also use my phone\u2019s camera a lot for work purposes. I use the internet on my phone a lot as well. ",

There was this one girl who I was close with that would text me surprisingly and would talk all night. Unfortunately our friendship dissolved and I miss her a lot. I might get a text or a call once a month and if I\u2019m lucky maybe two but generally I don\u2019t have anybody. ",
