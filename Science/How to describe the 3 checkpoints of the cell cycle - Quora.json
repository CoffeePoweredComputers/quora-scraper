            "answer_text": "A checkpoint is a stage in the eukaryotic cell cycle at which at which the cell examines internal and external cues and \"decides\" whether or not to move forward with division. There are a number of checkpoints, but the three most important ones are: The G[math]_1[/math]\u200b1\u200b\u200bstart subscript, 1, end subscript checkpoint, at the G[math]_1[/math]\u200b1\u200b\u200bstart subscript, 1, end subscript/S transition.The G[math]_2[/math]\u200b2\u200b\u200bstart subscript, 2, end subscript checkpoint, at the G[math]_2[/math]\u200b2\u200b\u200bstart subscript, 2, end subscript/M transition.The spindle checkpoint, at the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Diagram of cell cycle with checkpoints marked. G1 checkpoint is near the end of G1 (close to the G1/S transition). G2 checkpoint is near the end of G2 (close to the G2/M transition). Spindle checkpoint is partway through M phase, and more specifically, at the metaphase/anaphase transition. The G[math]_1[/math]\u200b1\u200b\u200bstart subscript, 1, end subscript checkpoint The G[math]_1[/math]\u200b1\u200b\u200bstart subscript, 1, end subscript checkpoint is the main decision point for a cell \u2013 that is, the primary point at which it must choose whether or not to divide. Once the cell passes the G[math]_1[/math]\u200b1\u200b\u200bstart subscript, 1, end subscriptcheckpoint and enters S phase, it becomes irreversibly committed to division. That is, barring unexpected problems, such as DNA damage or replication errors, a cell that passes the G[math]_1[/math]\u200b1\u200b\u200bstart subscript, 1, end subscript checkpoint will continue the rest of the way through the cell cycle and produce two daughter cells.  The G1 checkpoint. The G1 checkpoint is located at the end of G1 phase, before the transition to S phase. If cells don't pass the G1 checkpoint, they may \"loop out\" of the cell cycle and into a resting state called G0, from which they may subsequently re-enter G1 under the appropriate Reich machen wir Sie vielleicht auch \u00a9 Erfolgreich aber sicher! the G1 checkpoint, cells decide whether or not to proceed with division based on factors such as:Cell sizeNutrientsGrowth factorsDNA damage At the G[math]_1[/math]\u200b1\u200b\u200bstart subscript, 1, end subscript checkpoint, a cell check regulator.

            "answer_text": "In eukaryotic cells, or cells with a nucleus, the stages of the cell cycle are divided into two major phases: interphase and the mitotic (M) phase. During interphase, the cell grows and makes a copy of its DNA. Interphase is divided into 3 phases: G1 phase. During G1, phase, also called the first gap phase, the cell grows physically larger, copies organelles, and makes the molecular building blocks it will need in later steps.S phase. In S phase, the cell synthesizes a complete copy of the DNA in its nucleus. It also duplicates a microtubule-organizing structure called the centrosome. The centrosomes help separate DNA during M phase.G2 phase. During the second gap phase, or G2 phase, the cell grows more, makes proteins and organelles, and begins to reorganize its contents in preparation for mitosis. The G2;phase ends when mitosis begins.They r the check points before the cell goes for mitosis or cell division. If a cell cannot meet a particular requirement at a particular check point, it moves into G0 (zero) phase. ",
