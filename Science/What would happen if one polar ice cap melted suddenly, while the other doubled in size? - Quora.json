            "answer_text": "Q: What would happen if one polar ice cap melted suddenly, while the other doubled in size? A: This would mean that the earth\u2019s axis had titled so that one pole was now pointed towards the sun, and the other away from the sun. For most life forms living on the hemisphere now pointed towards the sun, temperatures would quickly rise rendering the land uninhabitable. For life forms on the other side, falling temperatures would have the same effect. Earth would experience the worst mass extinction event in its history. Perhaps some humans around the equator might be able to survive. ",

While such a circumstance would be most unlikely under the current orientation and orbital characteristics, there is certainly a possible scenario in which this would occur. Rather than answering what would happen though, it is somewhat more interesting to understand why that would occur. Essentially, it would mean the earth would have to be tilted towards the sun at a much greater angle AND the rotation of the earth would need to match the length of a year. ",
