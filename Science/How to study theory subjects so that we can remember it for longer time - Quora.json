            "answer_text": "Well, I have an interesting story for you. When in class 9, we were dealt with a pretty complex topic of digestive system. There were innumerable enzymes name and innumerable conversions taking place along the whole path of food from tongue till it is excreted out from the system. At the same time our biology teacher had left the school and we were struggling to have a new teacher for the subject. It was all theoretical as we had to learn each and every enzyme, organ from which it is secreted, place where it combines with the food, conversions that take place there and all that in the correct order! My friend Bhanu Pratap Singh Rawat (Bhanu) called me one night and asked if I can just explain him the working of digestive system.I had a brief idea of what goes on in the system, how things work in harmony to complete the process of digestion. Though I never studied it to completely understand myself, but my friend needed my help that night so I thought of something and explained the whole process on phone. Imagine yourself to be a spoonful of food. You have just entered the mouth and now you are resting in a pool of saliva on a tongue. Saliva starts extracting sugar from you while you are being ground into tiny little particles by the teeth. Now you slide down the food pipe. Chillax! it's a free fall, enjoy the ride. Now, thump! You landed in stomach. I know its pretty dark but don't worry, you can relax for a long time here. Let others do their work. Meanwhile liver extracts some enzymes, spleen and gall bladder also release enzymes to further digest the food. Water is taken out from you.(Here, in the sequential order I told him all the equations and their relevance in the process. Sorry I don't remember them now, it's been almost a decade since that call.)   After good three four hours it is time for you to resume your journey. Now you go into small intestine. It's a topsy turvy and kind of curvy journey. More enzymes follow you and take all good things you brought with yourself. Your colour is changing but don't worry it's part of the process. After sometime suddenly the ride, which seems more like a state bus ride, stops and you are in a much spacious area. The blood vessels, here, will take the rest of the nutrients that you brought with yourself.  And slowly, like a king, you will be out in the world again....only to be flushed down the drain! :P P.S.- I just shared how I made a topic interesting and informative enough to be remembered for a long time. You can also try for yourself. I remember stuff when there is a story associated with it or some interesting fact. You can find yours first and then work on it. All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Well to that question rather than advising you for something bombastic i would like to draw your attention on how you remember things. Now, when you go to your bed analyze your day like what things you did in that particular day in their order.You would find that your mind hardly cares about the things you do on regular basis and the phrase \"What you did?\" won't include things like brushing your teeth,bathing,clothing etc. Interestingly,if some event did occurred that day associated with a feel like you proposing someone,you getting into a fight[verbal] with someone say for some reasons etc.You would definitely remember that because those were reason being a)No regular event of your life b)Associated with a feeling Now,if you see the case of learning some new theory which is of course the part of our daily life but what we can do to remember those theory to last longer in our memory is we can associate it with things we are more familiar with like terms pandit-badri-prasad-har-har-bol which is actually a formula for sin(thetha),cos(thetha)...etc. For purely theory part like Newton's Third law you can associate it with daily life scenario like Slapping Someone!! Thirdly by knowing the application of theories will develop an interest of that theory.Like if you know the application of Pythagoras theorem you would get more enthusiastic about it,again feeling associated with it would make it last longer in memory.

            "answer_text": "Well this happened recently, During my training period in IBM Bangalore, we had one situation where everyone in my domain was struggling with concept of collections in java specially vector. As it was an important concept as well as, it is used very frequently, this made it a requisite for further training. After our daily training gets over, I stood up and started explaining to them an easy way to remember it. Imagine yourself a food delivery guy, and you only serve similar type of food like 3 chappatis, 1 dal, 1 salad, 2 sabzi, 1 sweet and only changes in order can be made is which dal or salad or sabzi they want to order and how much they want to order. You must be thinking how it can relate to Vector, let me explain bit more. So our java class is our thali and our different food items are its data members which can be different for different instances. So, we first fetch data from database as a result set , iterate it row wise and assign different attribute to relevant data member of object, after each row is completed pack your thali in small box (Class object) and place it in bigger box (Vector), and similarly you can place all your smaller boxes in a stack inside a bigger box. That's a natural way of packing anything. And then we will deliver our bigger box (Vector). And similarly unpacking of Bigger box (Vector) is done, we will open our vector, use iterator to point box sequentially and then one by one open our packed thali (class objects) and we retrieve our data members accordingly.

Basically what i want to say is try to make your study easier.... mine experience It a challenge for a CA student to retain the section in paper of law. But i have retain all the section of company law, and still i know it all.. The point is i had made a story type including the section. so it easy for me to retain you can follow the same.. For detail you can visti this link  ",
