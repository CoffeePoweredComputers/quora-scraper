            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think anything really replaces anything. There are various different times where something is more popular. Certainly, television supplanted radio for doing radio drama in North America, but it thrives again now. Radio wasn\u2019t dead because television came along. Are podcasts more popular than Youtube? Nope. But they are finally getting there. ",

            "answer_text": "Right now, no. But the popularity of podcasting has increased every year since 2004. YouTube is free. Podcasting is not. In both podcasting and youtube, those who take the time to put together an organized episode do the best. Those that that just press record with their friends are leaving a lot up to chance and that often doesn\u2019t work. ",
