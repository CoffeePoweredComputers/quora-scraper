            "answer_text": "The best realtor has your best interests at heart! They will advocate for you, from the first moments you begin thinking about purchasing, to when the ink is finally dry on the contracts. People get mixed up often by not realizing that unless explicitly defined, many realtors represent the seller, not them. Great realtors will go the extra mile to ensure the home you want is defect-free, and is properly priced for you. Especially if it\u2019s your first time purchasing a home, you need someone who knows the ins and outs of the industry, and can explain it to you in a way you understand best. An excellent realtor lays everything out for you on their website. You want to see transparency and an effort to talk to consumers in a real way. Content on their website should be helpful and in-depth, like how this site has a deep guide on how to buy a first home. In today\u2019s digital world, a poor website doesn\u2019t fare well, and it shows a lack of care about their image, which is huge for agents. Talk to people you trust who have had a realtor represent them as buyers before. A good referral is telling. If you know someone who\u2019s bought multiple homes with the same person, it\u2019s very telling that said person worked with the realtor multiple times. If they felt something was off, wouldn\u2019t they have taken their business elsewhere? Another aspect of the best realtor is, do you like them as a person? Is this someone you can see talking to for hours? Do you feel heard with this person? You may have found someone who\u2019s done millions of dollars in transactions, but are they friendly? Do you trust them with your personal finances? To be a good realtor, there needs to be more than numbers. A huge part of real estate is interacting with people, and you as the client need that respect. ",
