            "answer_text": "To answer whether he made the country great again, we just have to look at the statistics and what he\u2019s done so far as POTUS.  Everything is categorized in order from, Economy & Jobs, Immigration, Foreign Policy, Education, Environment, and healthcare. For Economy & Jobs: Under President Trump\u2019s leadership, Congress passed historic tax cuts and relief for hard-working Americans. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Provided tax relief for 82% of middle-class families.Doubled the Child Tax Credit proving an additional $1,000 per child in tax relief for working parents.Cut taxes for small business by 20%, providing $415 billion in tax relief for small business owners.Alleviated the tax burden on over 500 companies. who used those savings to fund bonuses, wage increases for 4.8 million workers.The Trump Administration launched the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity (W-GDP) Initiative, the first-ever whole-of-government approach focused on advancing women\u2019s full and free participation in the global economy and allocated $50 million for the fund.In terms of Immigration: The Department of Homeland Security launched the office of Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE).From President Trump\u2019s inauguration through FY 2019 to date, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made 269,419 arrests of illegal aliens.In June 2017, The Trump Administration announced the creation of the new National Public Safety Partnership, a cooperative initiative with cities to reduce violent crime.Mexico has agreed to deploy 6,000 national guard troops throughout the country and on its Southern border to stop the immigration crisis, dismantle human-smuggling networks, and work more closely with the U.S. to share information about migrants. (Thank you Mexico, your help is tremendous, believe me)President Trump called on Congress to fully fund a wall along the Southern border, to close legal loopholes that enable illegal immigration, to end chain migration, and to eliminate the visa lottery program.In terms of Foreign Policy: Upon entering office, the Trump Administration began renegotiations of trade agreements that contribute to the U.S. trade deficit and harmed American workers. One of President Trump\u2019s first actions was to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, advancing his agenda to protect American workers.With the completion of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, the Trump Administration successfully fulfilled President Trump\u2019s promise to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The USMCA is a modern trade agreement that opens new markets for U.S. farmers and manufacturers, will encourage increased manufacturing in the U.S., and allow workers and small businesses to flourish.The Trump Administration made enforcement of U.S. trade laws a top priority and has continually exercised its ability to block harmful trade practices and exchanges. To defend U.S. national security interests, President Trump blocked a foreign company from acquiring a U.S. business for only the fourth time in history.The President directed his Administration to consider a range of actions to respond to China\u2019s acts, policies, and practices involving the unfair and harmful acquisition of U.S. technology.Under President Trump, the United States has worked tirelessly to combat extremism and stick up for religious minorities. During his first international trip, President Trump pushed for a coalition of nations to confront Iran and attended the opening of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology. It was created to empower Muslim-majority countries in fighting radicalization. President Trump directed the State Department to send aid through USAID directly to Christians and other minorities facing genocide in the Middle East.In terms of Education: The Trump Administration implemented the year-round distribution of Pell grants, instead of limiting these grants to the spring and fall semesters. Low-income students will now have access to these funds over summer and winter breaks, so they can earn their degrees faster with fewer loans.The Trump Administration has reformed The Free Application for Federal Student Aid to make the program more accessible to students.The Department of Education provided $359.8 million in federal assistance to 20 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands to assist with the cost of educating students displaced by Hurricane Harvey, Irma, Maria, or the 2017 California wildfires.President Trump\u2019s proposed budgets have made school choice a priority. The President's FY2018 Budget Request included $1 billion in funding to Furthering Options of Children to Unlock Success Grants for public school choice and $250 million to promote private school choice through the Education Innovation and Research Program. In his FY2019 budget President Trump proposed a $5 billion federal tax credit on donations that fund scholarships to private and vocational schools, apprenticeships programs and other educational opportunities.In terms of Environment: President Trump\u2019s proposed budgets have made school choice a priority. The President's FY2018 Budget Request included $1 billion in funding to Furthering Options of Children to Unlock Success Grants for public school choice and $250 million to promote private school choice through the Education Innovation and Research Program. In his FY2019 budget President Trump proposed a $5 billion federal tax credit on donations that fund scholarships to private and vocational schools, apprenticeships programs and other educational opportunities.President Trump rescinded President Obama\u2019s costly Clean Power Plan and instead has proposed the Affordable Clean Energy Rule. According to NERA Economic Consulting, the CPP would have increased electricity rates by as much as 14 percent, costing American households up to $79 billion. The Affordable Clean Energy Rule will reduce greenhouse gasses, empower states, promote energy independence, and facilitate economic growth and job creation.President Trump announced his action to withdraw the U.S. from the unfair Paris Climate Agreement. (And yes the PCA is unfair as it would\u2019ve been too costly for our country to fund other nations ambition for clean energy as well as sacrificing too much while other nations would do very little to be environmentally friendly)And finally in terms of Healthcare: President Trump has worked to improve access to affordable quality health care.The Department of Agriculture provided more than $1 billion in FY2017 to be used to improve access to health care services for 2.5 million people in rural communities. The Trump administration expanded access to Association Health Plans (AHPs) allowing small business to pool risk across states. The Trump Administration allows for Short-Term Limited Duration plans to be extended up to 12 months.As part of the landmark Tax Cuts and Jobs Act President Trump repealed the individual mandate, which forced people to buy expensive insurance and taxed those who couldn\u2019t afford it.The mandate disproportionately hurt the poor: 80% of those affected made less than $50,000.President Trump has mobilized his entire administration to address drug addiction and opioid abuse by declaring the opioid crisis a nationwide public health emergency. President Trump created a bipartisan opioid commission that issued 56 recommendations to help defeat the opioid crisis. In October 2017, President Trump directed The Department of Health and Human Services to declare the opioid crisis a public health emergency, allowing grant money to be used to combat abuse. President Trump signed the International Narcotics Trafficking Emergency Response by Detecting Incoming Contraband with Technology (INTERDICT Act) that would give customs agents $9 million for screening tools on the border. In FY2017, HHS invested nearly $900 million in opioid-specific funding. President Trump successfully pressured China to close dangerous loopholes that allowed Chines fentanyl manufacturers to legally ship the compound worldwide, much of which ended up in the U.S.Whether you like him or not. He did a good job for this country and the facts show it. We don\u2019t need to be respected by the world to be a great country, the number of people who legally immigrate here proves that the word respects us and that people would rather drop everything to come seek a better life here. We don\u2019t need to show the world how much we love the environment when we are naturally progressing towards a cleaner nation without the need of government intervention. I should even add in that it\u2019s our amazing preservation of our clean national parks that inspired the Chinese government to create national parks of their own. We don\u2019t need to help the world before helping ourselves. Our nation has donated the most resources to the world, yet we do not ask for anything in return. When a disaster strikes your country, we send aid. But when a disaster strikes our country, no one but our immediate neighbors help us. Whether you like Trump or not, he made America great again and that\u2019s what\u2019s important to us. God bless you all and God bless the United States of America.

Funny thing is that it didn\u2019t matter to them when Obama boasted the same. And they overlook the periods of instability in the markets that turnip\u2019s mindless tweets and petulant ranting have caused. And they haven\u2019t commented on the fact that the Covid-19 worries for the US are cutting into those rises \u2014 because we may be in real danger. We have great healthcare hidden behind a mess of a paywall, our working-class being told to suck it up and come to work even if they are infected, our skeleton-crew government not set up to endure any large crises, a president telling the elderly who worship him that they are in no danger, and a zealot who has already presided over the creation of another epidemic being put in charge of the response. Never mind his \u201cKatrina Moment,\u201d a couple unfortunate twists and we have a nation-testing disaster on our hands, made worse by the ineptitude of the handling. Past that\u2026 we are more divided as a nation\u2026 we feel less safe\u2026 we are less safe on the national scale, with our allies alienated and insulted by the boorish comments and gross ignorance of our president\u2026 we have seen instances of bullying in schools skyrocket due to the \u201ctrump effect\u201d and membership in the adult-bullying organizations of hate groups increasing\u2026 we have seen opportunists taking advantage of the chaos and skimming off the top\u2026 we have seen corruption and partisanship rule the day time and time again\u2026 There is no way that a corrupt nation run by fools and opportunists could be considered \u201cgreat.\u201d We are less Great than we were six years ago. At least trump hasn\u2019t compromised our withdrawal from Afghanistan. He\u2019ll try to take credit for all the hard work that went into our ceasefire, to be sure, despite having little to do with it and how conditional it is. ",

            "answer_text": "America was great before Trump. Maybe a little banged up and bruised, but still great. Yes, we had (have) our problems and ups and downs just like any nation but America is still great. Since his arrival in office, we have lost allies, become a laughing stock, mistrusted. He\u2019s all about the rich regardless of the bs and babble that comes out of his mouth. He is a pathological liar and can\u2019t even keep his lies straight and even sadder is he believes the lies he tells. For him, there is only one reality\u2026 his. His reality has nothing to do with truth or facts - facts just confuse him. Even sadder, he is taking credit for things put into play during the Obama era. He talks badly about Obama, but the fact is Obama always had the people of America in mind when making policy. I find it hysterical when they talk about \u201cObama care\u201d when in fact it was the Republicans that wrote it and only a couple of minor changes were made before it was put into law. What has the current executive done? Dismantle programs designed to help the American People which in turn helps America - he doesn\u2019t understand that, he has opened up public lands to exploitation by his rich cronies, he has rescinded air and water quality standards. He understands rape and pillage of resources and has no care for future generations. He has abandoned the Kyoto accords because \u201cGlobal warming is a myth\u201d. He mocks science because he doesn\u2019t understand it. It doesn\u2019t seem as if he understands much of anything besides how to use people and resources for his own selfish ends. Anything he doesn\u2019t believe or understand is a lie. Anytime he is called to account for his actions, it\u2019s a witch hunt. The man is totally incapable of admitting fault or acknowledging his own more than questionable actions. He has repeatedly shown that he has no clue what exactly the powers of the executive entail and has no understanding of the constitution. Gosh, I could keep going on, but we all know, see and hear it every single day. Here\u2019s another tidbit you don\u2019t ever hear about in the news\u2026 his so called tax cuts for the working people? Yeah, he cut payroll taxes, but without changing tax laws people who used to get an income tax refund now have to pay. This includes many seniors who were caught totally off guard with that. No, he doesn\u2019t deserve to be re-elected. And if he is, I feel sorry for America and I\u2019ll be retiring out of the country. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll be able to afford to retire. ",

He has shown the Republican Party to be a bunch of \u201cStepford Wives\u201d with no thoughts of their own as well as spineless; no back bone. The once respected Republican Party has loss all sense of law, morality and just good old common sense. Their \u201cPied Piper\u2019s \u201c term is soon ending. He will not only have earned the title of impeachment, but will soon add to his resume a member of the \u201cone term President club\u201d; both of which his favorite person \u201cObama\u201d was able to totally avoid. The American people are not as stupid as he is counting on. He slid into the White House because people failed to use their voting power effectively and just plain \u201dshow up\u201d to vote. Different scenario now. Eyes wide open, 4 more years of his nonsense- not gonna happen!! People will show up to vote his ass out with the fierceness as if if was \u201cObama\u201d being counted out for a second term. Karma is a bitch, and now \u201cCorona \u201c seems to have popped up to wreak havoc at a time to further show his incompetence as a leader and further show him for the liar and idiot that he is- the great \u201cSwami\u201d who PREDICTS this viruses exit when it gets warm. GET A GRIP!! He fails to even listen to SCIENTISTS and continues on a daily to confirm his total lack of skill needed to lead a country. I know our misery will soon end, this embarrassment will be voted out and this nightmare will soon be over. The survival of DEMOCRACY depends on it!!! ",

However, he has definitely played a part in improving the \u201cquality of the American lifestyle\u201d in some aspects, while it has gotten worse in others. In regards to a second term, I don't like him, I don't think he DESERVES a second term, but I don't believe that anyone deserves a second term, they earn a second term by performing well in the first and in the campaign for the second term. However, I will say this. People keep saying no because \u201che divided the country\u201d. We need to remember that America was divided well before Trump was elected into office. Hell, it was divided before Trump even announced his candidacy back in 2015. But hey, it's a free countty, right? TLDR: No, but under extenuating circumstances; no, but it is not something that anyone is entitled to. ",
