The reasons people hurt themselves are many, but the most common are: It allows them to cope with problemsIt relieves themIt stops them from feeling angry or lonely,The have low esteemThey may have been abusedThey may have an addiction problemThey may no feel lovedThey may not be able to express their feelings and the only way they do that is by cutting themselvesIt\u2019s the only way they can really feel, because they have blocked their normal feelingsThey are copying somebody else doing it,Etc., you get the ideaThe only solution is to get professional help. Normal people deal with all the above by getting angry, by asking for explanations, by expressing their feelings, be letting go, by opening up, and by asking for help or explaining what\u2019s happening to them on the inside. If you can\u2019t then you need to ask for help. This can be anybody from a teacher, to and adult family member you trust, your grandparents, a priest or religious leader, a doctor friend, a help line,and even local youth groups or centers. But please get help, it\u2019s the only way out. Your problem is not the harm you are doing to yourself, but your incapability to deal with your emotions, abuse, pain, loneliness, lack of love or whatever may be affecting you. You are not alone, many people have these symptoms, and many have been helped and got over it! So please ask and get help! I\u2019m with you! ",

            "answer_text": "Self-destructive behavior in most cases is simply a behavioral pattern. I assume it bothers you so you are looking for the ways to break it. Understanding where the impetus for self-destructing behavior is seeded is important but not necessary. You can fight the symptoms first and see what kind of change it will bring to your life. Start changing your routines, change your environment, gravitate towards people who help you to foster desired behavior. If you are really concerned about the reasons, then sit down and write. All your self-reflections should be in the written form. Ask yourself questions: When did it started?How do I feel right before I do the things that are harmful for me?What are my thoughts in that very moment?How do I feel while I am doing it?How do I feel after?What are my projections of the future? What my life will be if I continue the same behavior after 1 years? After 5 years?Ask yourself uncomfortable questions and be ready to dig deep to find the answers. The truth is that there although there are some general fundamentals behind self-destructing behavior, no one will be able to tell you what exactly initiates it in your particular case. You have to dissect your psyche yourself. Good luck in doing that, Chengeer. ",
