            "answer_text": "As you are asking \u201chow\u201d did I gain interest in mathematics and science, i will share my story which is not very inspiring but can give you essence of going forth in these majors. Until i was in class 5 i had no idea what these subject are and how interesting they can be. I assumed that these are just common and wierd subjects as social science and English (seriously i hated both social and english. dont know why but now i realise that due to the method of teaching or my fault). I Gave freaking looks on my science and maths teacher. Then after stepping to class 6 i started gaining interest in science. (Major reason was my science teacher who taught us very well and interestingly he was mocking and weird man i ever seen in my life). I gained good knowledge in science and i was changed to Normal students from dumb student. Maths story was quite different. There was one guy (lets say him A ) who i hated a lot just because of his bold and arrogant nature. But he was good in maths and probably best in class. I feel irritated and this inspired me to study mathematics and give tough competition in class. (The guy mentioned above is now my best friend and we both give healthy competition to each other. We assume ourselves \u201cbrothers\u201d) So in math i changed from dumb to normal student. Class 6 -8 was spent as a normal student with good interest in mathematics. But the major change came after passing class 8. Exams were over and we were planning to do something new. I came to know about IIT from this guy A who told me how prestigious this institute was and how hard it was to crack JEE. So we decided to enroll in one foundation course and soon we both were the best in class for our calculation speed and extra knowledge.whenever our maths and science teacher ask question or numerical we were first to raise hands. (We say to ourselves that \u201c those were the days of legends!! ) Now from class 9 to 10 i was changed from normal student to a good student. You see the transformation dumb < Normal < Good. Lets sum up here . The conclusion is : Gaining interest in maths and science is not a big deal. The only difference is our approach to these subject and other factors ( which you may have noticed in the beginning of my answer). You cannot control \u201cother factors\u201d but you can definitely control your approach and that will certainly change these factors in favour of you. ",

            "answer_text": "How do I gain interest in mathematics and science ? Now I don't know which year you are in , considering your question you said mathematics and science , didn't specify physics/biology/other science subjects Considering you are in school still , I would advise you don't skip any concepts even the ones which are unnecessary looking one's Because if you make a habit of skipping them later on you wouldn't know what you don't know And mainly PRACTICE , in the beginning it gets really annoying for not understanding them , which is why you start losing interest in the subject , you just have to pull through that phase Once you do you will start to develop interest in the subject , if you forget a concept were it down till you remember , forgot the theorem ? Write it down so many times that even if someone wakes you up at 3 am and ask you to write the theorem you should be able to (my maths sir had told this) Same goes for science , know the meaning of the term DO NOT MUG UP ANSWERS , you have access to the internet use it , try to find the meaning and you will start developing interest in the subject ",

I viewed Physics as understanding the world, better. At least better than Civics. I viewed Biology as \u2014 Actually, nevermind. I hate biology. I viewed Maths as what it is. Numbers. Fucking numbers. People are scared of numb \u2014 \u201cCut the crap! Tell us about Biology! It falls in Science!\u201d Fine. Biology has all aforementioned subjects in it. Maths: \u201cx amount of y is present in z and their movement around\u2026\u201dChemistry: \u201cx amount of y is present in z and their movement around\u2026\u201dPhysics: \u201cx amount of y is present in z and their movement around\u2026\u201dSo, would I rather study all the STEMs than 3?

So fusing them with things we like or have fun doing in would be the best possible way through. These are the subjects of practically utmost importance. so ignoring them is never gonna help you. Fusing them with dance, music, favourite games would help to overcome ua boring attitude towards these subjects. ",
