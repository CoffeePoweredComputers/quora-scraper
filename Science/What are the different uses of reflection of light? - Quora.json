Fiber Optics \u2014 Light is guided in optical fibers due to total internal reflection, which is an artifact of refraction. This has proved to be a real work horse for piping high-speed information around the world. If you are interested, here is a link to a short video explaining why refraction happens using graphics and animations. https://empossible.net/academics/free-videos/ ",

It may reflect partially or completely,it depends upon the type of material on which the light is falling.reflection property is used to view images in mirrors in our daily life,and reflection of light is used to measure the distance like depth of the ocean,at what altitude the flight is flying,to locate the distance of the enemy ships in navy etc. ",
