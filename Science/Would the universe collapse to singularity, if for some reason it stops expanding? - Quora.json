            "answer_text": "There are theoretical reasons to believe the universe is powered by expansion - as I and others have shown, the gravitational attraction created by masses is the result of the expansion factor 4(pi)G. This term happens to have a value that very closely approximates Einstein\u2019s Cosmological Constant term \u201c Lambda x R/3\u201d which has a present value in the range of c^/R. If the root cause of gravity is expansion, then w/o expansion, there would be no cause for collapse. It is probably safe to assume that expansion is intimately tied to the existence of a process that creates positive and negative energy equally, ergo, the universe must expand as it is intrinsically linked to factors that determine the existence of the universe. Regarding Expansion, Eddington had this to say: \u201cThe conception of the expanding universe seems to crown the edifice of physical science like a lofty pinnacle. I few years ago I became strongly convinced that in these astronomical discoveries in the remoteness of space, we had picked up the key to the mysteries of the proton and electron \u2026.\u201d Incidentally, there is a force predictive model of the electron based upon cosmological expansion.

Mathematicians will say that this solution is unstable. Well, at that point, I will just turn the table and say that GR is wrong..:) Marco Pereira's answer to How would anyone defend general relativity from Marco Pereira's HU challenge? and start a brawl, so pointless it is to discuss Singularities..:) and 4D Spacetime\u2026:) Time Dilation\u2026etc ",
