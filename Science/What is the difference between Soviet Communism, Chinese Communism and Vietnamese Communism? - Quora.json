            "answer_text": "Commuism as an idea originated from the writings of Karl Marx (1818 - 1883), a German philosopher [ Karl Marx ], who saw the social disaster that the English Industrial Revolution had turned into (slums, broken families, rich capitalists etc.) He spoke of revolutionary socialism. His ideas were appealing, and his writings inflammatory. [ Marx & Engels Selected Works ] (1) SOVIET COMMUNISM - When Vladimir Lenin finally succeeded in ousting the Romanov dynasty and its monarchical rule from Russia in 1917 ( Russian Revolution ), he realised that Marx's ideas needed a lot of local modification to turn into a 'State level Communist government'. Thus was born the Soviet model - Soviet = Workers' Committee to run/decide things [ Soviet (council) ]. These \"Soviets\" would run the show across the USSR, and they did for many decades, before internal imbalances, a huge defence budget and collapse of global oil prices destroyed them [ Dissolution of the Soviet Union ]. Essentially, Soviet Communism = Revolution of the Industrial Workers + Leninism + Stalinism. It ended 1992, and today Mr Putin runs the most centralised capitalistic state imaginable!  (2) CHINESE COMMUNISM - When Mao Tse-tung finally succeeded in ousting the Kuomintang Party (KMT) and its leader Chiang Kai-shek from the mainland (they ran away to Taiwan - today's ROC), the PRC as we know of today [ China ] came into being in 1949. Mao realised he had a poor nation that needed radical reforms. He tried many things, most of which were utter disasters. In the process, he fell apart from the Soviets who despised him. Then, post his death, Deng Xiaoping came to power and liberalised Chinese economy, while retaining brutal central Party control. Thus began PRC's modern rise (1979 till date). Essentially - Chinese Communism (1949 to 1979) = Revolution of the Peasants and Rural Folks (Maoism)Chinese Communism (1979 till date) = Capitalism controlled by Communist Party's whims (3) VIETNAMESE COMMUNISM - The French had directly controlled Vietnam from 1858 till 1945, as a colony. It was exploitative. The communists got independence for Vietnam in 1945, and it has been a one-party socialist republic ever since. The key communist leader was Ho Chi Minh [ Ho Chi Minh ] who maintained relations with both USSR and China and fought the colonial French rule. The Americans got involved, fearing South Vietnam would be won by the North and Communism would spread, and then came the bloody two decades Vietnam War (1955 - 1975), another proxy Cold War. Finally, the communists prevailed. The capture of Saigon by the North Vietnamese Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year. Essentially, Vietnamese Communism = One Party Socialism (based on Marxism + Leninism + Ho Chi Minh Thought)  Hope it helped!

            "answer_text": "The differences are not as significant as the similar lie, that they are or have had, anything to do with communism or socialism. The terms mean the same, common or social ownership of the means ind instruments for creating and distributing wealth, by and on behalf of the whole population. It requires an educated working class which will make the revolution and is to be built over a developed capitalist infrastructure to enable a production for use free access society. It will be a classless society. Socialism/communism is an advanced , post-capitalist society, run by us all, locally, regionally, globally, in administration over resources and not a government over people. It is a market -free, money -free, production for use (not for sale), free access (not rationed access) commonly owned,(not private, corporate or state owned) revolutionary permanent break with the present capitalist one. It has never existed anywhere. It is not a \u2018reformist\u2019 nor a \u2018statist\u2019 version of capitalism which retains wage slavery in any form. It is the mature, politically conscious task of the immense majority to make it happen and not the minority vanguardist led actions of pseudo-revolutionaries. If there are wages and salaries, it is not socialism/communism. State ownership is not socialism/communism. Social programs are not socialism/communism. Socialism/communism means democracy at all levels of society, including the workplace. Socialism/communism means a wageless, moneyless society. Socialism/communism means voluntary labour. Socialism/communism means free access to the goods produced by society. \u201cThe organising tenet will be from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.\u201d _________________________________________________________________  \" The emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves. We cannot, therefore, co-operate with people who openly state that the workers are too uneducated to emancipate themselves and must be freed from above by philanthropic big bourgeois and petty bourgeois.\"(1879 Marx and Engels ) ",
