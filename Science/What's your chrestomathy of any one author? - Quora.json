            "answer_text": "The collected adult short stories by Roald Dahl. He is primarily famous for his children's novels like \"Matilda\" and \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\". However, his short stories written for adults are an absolute pleasure to read and give great insight into the human condition. Some of my favourites are \"Taste\", \"Neck\" and \"Skin\". They have weird titles and an unconventional storyline, but that only increases one's fascination. ",
