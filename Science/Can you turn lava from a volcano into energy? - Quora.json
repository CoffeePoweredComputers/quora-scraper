            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a great question to seriously think about. Thanks to the advancement of technology , i think it is completely achievable. See, to predict earthquakes , as of yet is pretty difficult, whereas Volcanoes are quite predictable considering the available technologies. So if we can build lead coated or nano material which resist ultra high temperature and pressure, then we can simply dig a hole, insert the pipe and pump out the lava outside and use its heat to convert steam or like a Molten Salt Reactor ( water steam will become highly unstable and possibly radioactive). The cooled lava can be used for various purposes like raw material for building purpose, filling dumping yards or can be dumped straight into sea. What we can achieve from here is mainly 2 things Energy from the lava can be extracted in a controlled way. and believe me if we can even achieve an efficiency of 5%, a huge amount of energy can be obtained from one single volcano.Possible volcanic eruption can be prevented as we decrease the pressure by taking the lava out. Hence saving the world from all the negatives of another volcanic eruption.Possible problems that we may face: Exorbitant price: The initial cost will be huge. and finding the perfect material for extracting lava requires loads of research.Maintenance: The maintenance has to be done automatically, especially the instruments in direct contact with lava need continuous maintenance which can only be done by robots as human cannot tolerate the radioactivity.The amount of lava to diffuse a volcanic eruption can be huge ( read millions of ton) so this require a huge machinery.the waste disposal is again a big trouble.I need to read more about this to see if it is actually doable but let me assure you this possibility sure is safer than creating suns on earth (read Fusion Reaction O:) ). And it also doesn\u2019t require much complicated processes , all we need is right materials and right techniques. Hope we see this happening within the next few decades. N.B- As of yet, all the above content is a product of my imagination. :D :) ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Mother nature allows us to cheat a little because the heat from the lava is transferred into the rock surrounding every volcano. That hot rock stays hot for a long time, continually heated by the nearby lava. So, what we can do is drill holes down into the hot rock to extract that abundant energy in the form of heat. It is called \u201cHot rock energy\u201d or scientifically: geothermal energy. To get the energy out into a form that can be used in turbines to make electricity, they pump water down into the boreholes. This gets heated and converted to steam, the steam expands in the turbine and cranks the electricity making machine. This is such a clean way of making electricity. Once the steam condenses at the downstream end of the process, the water is collected and recycled back down into the borehole to make more steam. It\u2019s not quite as simple as this, but in principle, this is the science behind getting energy from lava. ",

            "answer_text": "We already do in an indirect sort of way. We use the internal heat from the Earths crust to produce geothermal energy. The earth naturally gets hotter the deeper you get, and you don't have to go very deep to reach energy producing temperatures. This is done using drilling rigs. Trying to use actual lava would be very dangerous and unpredictable. Volcanic eruptions are extremely hazardous. Even the pretty gooey ones you see on Hawaii. Only super villains would dare such a thing. ",
