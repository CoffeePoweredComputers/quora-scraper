            "answer_text": "To expand a little bit on Ian\u2019s answer, I think it is important for you to understand the manner in which we come about this 9.81 [math]\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2} [/math] acceleration that we experience on the earth\u2019s surface. First of all, the force of gravitational attraction between two objects (ignoring direction/signs) is : [math]F = \\frac{GMm}{r^2}, [/math]where M is the mass of the larger object (the planet in this case), m is the mass of the smaller object (person), r is the distance between the two objects\u2019 center of mass, and G is the universal gravitation constant, which we precisely know as a result of years of experimentation. ([math]G =6.67408 \\times 10^{-11} \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{kg}\\quad\\text{s}^2}[/math]). Using this mathematical approach, along with Newton\u2019s second law which states that when a force [math]F[/math] is applied to an abject with mass [math] m [/math] the resulting acceleration [math]a[/math] of that object is simply the force divided by the mass ([math]F = ma)[/math], [math] [/math]it is a straightforward matter to determine [math]g[/math], the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of a planet. [math]F = mg = G\\frac{Mm}{r^2}[/math] [math]g = \\frac{GM}{r^2}[/math] So you just plug in the known quantities ([math]G,[/math]the mass of the planet/moon/star, and in this case [math]r[/math] is simply the radius of the body in equation). For Mars, [math]M = 6.4171 \\times 10^{23}[/math] kg and [math]r = 3.3895 \\times 10^{6} [/math]m[math].[/math] Plugging this in, we see that [math]g = 3.7279 \\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}^2}[/math] on the surface of Mars. This can be done for any other spherical body in our universe, although things get a little weird when talking about black holes (if the black hole is small, your head will feel much much less \u2018pull\u2019 than your head, hence the spaghettification phenomenon).

            "answer_text": "The idea for acceleration due to gravity is very simple. If you drop a body from a certain height under the influence of gravity, you will observe that the velocity of the body increases CONSTANTLY. Thus, there is an acceleration acting upon the bodies which are in free fall and this acceleration is better known as acceleration due to gravity. The expression for acceleration due to gravity actually comes from Newton\u2019s Gravitational law. Vishakh Rajendran's answer to What is Newton's Law of Gravitation? Between two bodies, irrespective of their mass and the distance between them, there is a gravitational force that is present. The expression for this gravitational force is F = G M m / r^2. This gravitational force is significant if the masses of the body is very large and if the distance between them is small. By Newton\u2019s second law of motion, we know that F = m a. When under the influence of gravity alone, this \u2018a\u2019 can be replaced by acceleration due to gravity \u2018g\u2019. Thus, F = G M m / r^2 = m g. We can cancel the \u2018m\u2019 terms on both the sides. Thus, G M = g r^2 (or) g = G M / r^2  So, the acceleration due to gravity depends only upon three factors a. Gravitational constant (which is universally a constant) G=6.67\u00d710^-11 m3 / kgs2 b. Mass of the larger body (in this case Mars) c. Distance between the body and the planet\u2019s centre. This corresponds to radius of the planet if we are talking about the surface of the planet. So, the mass of the object isn\u2019t an important consideration and can be safely ignored. So if we know the mass of mars, we can determine the acceleration due to gravity. The mass of mars is 6.41\u00d710^23 kg and radius of mars is 3.3\u00d710^6 m. Why do we consider the radius? Because normally we calculate the value of \u2018g\u2019 at the sea level (that is, the surface). Even for the case of Earth, the value of g has been determined to be 9.81 m/s^2 at the surface of the earth (At sea level). So , using these values, the value for \u2018g\u2019 at the surface of mars is 3.72 m/s^2.  Compared to Earth, the value of \u2018g\u2019 at mars is just around 40%. This is because, a. Mass of Earth is 5.86 x 10^24 Kg whereas the mass of mars is 6.41\u00d710^23 kg. b. Radius of Earth is 6.3\u00d710^6 m whereas the radius of mars is 3.3\u00d710^6 m ",
