            "answer_text": "Neither of the two theories of relativity \u201ccollect all the physical theories\u201d. Now, if we are talking about \u201cSpecial Relativity\u201d (aka E = mc^2), then for something to exist in our universe it must necessarily have energy and/or mass (relativistic or otherwise). Or it doesn\u2019t exist. So when you are talking about anything which exists, a formula that\u2019s talking about mass/energy would summarily include it. Especially the full formula which has both the rest and relativistic mass in it, because some objects only have relativistic mass and lack rest mass. The reason behind all the hype over the truncated E=mc^2 formula is not because it is profound or somehow innovative, but rather because of its elegance (and lending itself well to being printed on t-shirts for people who want to appear smart). Physicists like elegant formulae with as few factors as possible. The rule is that the fewer the variables/factors a formula has - the more superior it is considered among the physicists. Plus, there indeed was a very serious drive to do concerted PR support for Einstein at the time due to geopolitical reasons. What Einstein fundamentally did was, in essence, take some known laws of electromagnetism and extrapolate them to a broader context. The whole highly hyped E=mc^2 is based on the Lorentz Transformation and the implications thereof. The Lorentz transformation itself was based on the works of the likes of Maxwell and FitzGerald[1] . Now, I am not saying that Einstein wasn\u2019t great. Though he hardly contributed anything new per se, the ways how he summarised both the General and Special relativity were undoubtedly exemplar of the true genius of the highest caliber.

Relativity has been demonstrated as correct time and time again, many times by prediction and experiment, sometimes by failure and fixing the problem using relativity Theory.
