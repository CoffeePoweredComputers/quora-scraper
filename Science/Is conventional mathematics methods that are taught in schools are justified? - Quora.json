As I understand right- and left-wing politics, the labels refer to opposing positions on policy issues that are related to the liberal-conservative continuum of ideologies. I don\u2019t see that addition to left or right is at all related to this concept except in the sense that left-wing notions are often associated with change and addition left to right might represent change from the more conservative right to left method. Such a cognitive habit might have implications for other policies, but, at present, I don\u2019t see how. ",
