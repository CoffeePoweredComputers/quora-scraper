            "answer_text": "As much as I can make out 1) electrons maintain electrical neutrality of atoms.2) they are transferred in between metallic and non metallic atoms ,that's how they form ionic bonds.3) they are shared in between atoms to make covalent bonds.4) they impart colours to salts.5) their configuration around the nucleas gives the energy of the atom in that state.6) they are necessary to explain atomic spectra.7) they are the reason,why we have switched to quantum mechanical model of atom from Bohr' s model.
