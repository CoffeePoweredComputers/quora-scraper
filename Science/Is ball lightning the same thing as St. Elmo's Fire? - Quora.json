            "answer_text": "Is ball lightning the same thing as St. Elmo's Fire? Short answer: No \u2014 these are two different phenomena (one of which is in dispute). Saint Elmo\u2019s Fire is a straight-forward electricity phenomenon, which could be said to be \u201cthe lightning bolt that couldn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 not enough charge oomph to initiate a full discharge. First \u2014 Who is/was Elmo? From Wikipedia article Erasmus (Elmo) of Formia: Saint Erasmus may have become the patron of sailors because he is said to have continued preaching even after a thunderbolt struck the ground beside him. This prompted sailors, who were in danger from sudden storms and lightning, to claim his prayers. The electrical discharges at the mastheads of ships were read as a sign of his protection and came to be called \u201cSaint Elmo's Fire\u201d[more below]. For ball lightning, there is at present no widely accepted scientific explanation for what it is or may be. Reported sighting descriptions vary wildly, many appear to have been colored by the witness\u2019 state of mind at the time of sighting, and many reek of both superstitious and religious overtones (these last two may be the same). Until I read a paper with well documented results from repeatable experiments, scientifically explaining what \u201cball lightning\u201d actually is, I will remain doubtful (but hey, that\u2019s me, and I\u2019m no subject matter authority). To each his/her own! From Wikipedia article Ball Lightning(bold added): Ball lightning is an unexplained and potentially dangerous atmospheric electricalphenomenon. The term refers to reports of luminous,spherical objects that vary from pea-sized to several meters in diameter. Though usually associated with thunderstorms,the phenomenon lasts considerably longer than the split-second flash of a lightningbolt. Two reports from the nineteenth century claim that the ball eventually explodes, leaving behind an odor of sulfur. Until the 1960s, most scientiststreated reports of ball lightning skeptically, despite numerous accounts from around the world. Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but how these relate to the natural phenomenon remains unclear.[ \u2026 ]Characteristics Descriptions of ball lightning vary widely. It has been described as moving up and down, sideways or in unpredictable trajectories, hovering and moving with or against the wind; attracted to, unaffected by, or repelled from buildings, people, cars and other objects. Some accounts describe it as moving through solid masses of wood or metal without effect, while others describe it as destructive and melting or burning those substances. Its appearance has also been linked to power lines,altitudes of 1,000 feet (300 m) and higher, and during thunderstorms and calm weather. Ball lightning has been described as transparent, translucent, multicolored, evenly lit, radiating flames, filaments or sparks, with shapes that vary between spheres, ovals, tear-drops, rods, or disks. Ball lightning is often erroneously identified as St. Elmo's fire.They are separate and distinct phenomena. The balls have been reported to disperse in many different ways, such as suddenly vanishing, gradually dissipating, absorption into an object, \"popping,\" exploding loudly, or even exploding with force, which is sometimes reported as damaging.Accounts also vary on their alleged danger to humans, from lethal to harmless. From Wikipedia article St. Elmo's Fire(bold added): St. Elmo's fire (also St. Elmo's light) is a weather phenomenonin which luminous plasma is created by a coronal dischargefrom a sharp or pointed object in a strong electric fieldin the atmosphere(such as those generated by thunderstormsor created by a volcanic eruption).[ \u2026 ]Characteristics St. Elmo's fire is a bright blue or violet glow, appearing like fire in some circumstances, from tall, sharply pointed structures such as lightning rods,masts, spiresand chimneys,and on aircraft wingsor nose cones. St. Elmo's fire can also appear on leaves and grass, and even at the tips of cattle horns. Often accompanying the glow is a distinct hissing or buzzing sound. It is sometimes confused with ball lightning,In 1751, Benjamin Franklin hypothesized that a pointed iron rod would light up at the tip during a lightning storm, similar in appearance to St. Elmo's fire. Cause St. Elmo's fire is a form of plasma. The electric fieldaround the object in question causes ionizationof the air molecules, producing a faint glow easily visible in low-light conditions. Conditions that can generate St. Elmo's fire are present during thunderstorms, when high voltage differentials are present between clouds and the ground underneath. A local electric fieldof approximately 100 kV/m is required to induce a discharge in air. The magnitude of the electric field depends greatly on the geometry (shape and size) of the object. Sharp points lower the necessary voltage because electric fields are more concentrated in areas of high curvature,so discharges preferably occur and are more intense at the ends of pointed objects. The nitrogenand oxygenin the Earth's atmosphere cause St. Elmo's fire to fluorescewith blue or violet light; this is similar to the mechanism that causes neon lightsto glow. Cut from greencomet.org article Saint Elmo\u2019s Fire(bold added): Saint Elmo\u2019s fireis sometimes confused with ball lightning,but the two phenomena are quite different. While Saint Elmo\u2019s fire is a well-understood and predictable electrical event, ball lightningis unpredictable and not yet fully understood. Saint Elmo\u2019s fire is always associated with solid objects, such as ship masts and airplane wings, while ball lightning\u2019s main identifying feature is its independence.  Image credit \u2013 John Kain Saint Elmo\u2019s fire forms when there is a strong electrical field around the object (mast or wing, eg) which causes air molecules to become ionized,creating a visible plasma.It\u2019s a relatively mild cousin of lightning. In a mechanism similar to aurora, the ionized nitrogen and oxygen molecules fluoresce with blue or violet light.

Observations of ball lightning have been reported for centuries, but the origin of this phenomenon remains an enigma. The \"average\" ball lightning appears as a sphere with a diameter of 300 mm, a lifetime of about 10 s, and a luminosity similar to a 100 W lamp. It floats freely through the air, and ends either in an explosion, or by simply fading from view.  Far-fetched hypotheses abound, none very convincing (to me, that is!) Thanks for asking, Annika! I learned a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "St. Elmo\u2019s fire is a corona discharge that happens when a static discharge ionizes the air around sharp points like the top of masts and such. Ball lightning is believed to be plasma. There are numerous observations of the phenomenon but little analysis has been done because of the random nature of its occurrence. My grandmother was a switchboard operator in a tiny town of Texas around 1900. Lightning struck the lines outside of the telephone office during a thunderstorm. She said a ball popped out of the switchboard, rolled across the desk, fell onto the floor and then exploded. No one was injured. ",
