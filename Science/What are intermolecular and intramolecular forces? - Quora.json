            "answer_text": "lets first understand meaning of intermolecule and intramolecule; intermolecule means between the molecules and intramolecule means within the molecules. Lets take a molecule \u2019 H-Cl \u2018 the bond you see within the molecule HCl or between hydrogen and chlorine is intramolecular bond or force experienced by H and Cl. \u2014[H-Cl]\u2014[H-Cl]\u2014, The bond(\u2018\u2014\u2019) between the molecules of [H-Cl] is called intermolecular bond or force experienced by [H-Cl] and [H-Cl]. Hope this helps! ",

            "answer_text": "Intramolecular Forces:- Forces which comes into action within the molecule. Eg. In CO2 molecule the force because of which two oxygen atom are bounded to carbon atom is because of bons formed due to intramolecular forces called covalent bonds. Intermolecular Force:- Forces which comes into play between two neighbouring molecules. Eg. Force of attraction between two hydrogen bonded molecules. ",
