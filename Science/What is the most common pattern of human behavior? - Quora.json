            "answer_text": "We give love to naturally receive love, we are courteous and exhibit good manners in order to receive acceptance in society. We strive to help raise our kids better than we were raised (hopefully for the best interest of the child, but more often than none to prove that success happened to the parent\u2019s credit.) When we have lost everything and failed in our lives, when we are alone and do not know where to turn somehow this is how people discover God and/or begin to have a reason to turn to God. (excluding those who do not believe in a spiritual being). I rarely have seen patient on the verge of death (and this almost everyday for me) who hasn\u2019t somehow told their story, expressed regret, or have wished they could go back and change some things. When we are at our weakest, we automatically wish we could have done better, we would go back and change the way we were to our friends or family, if we could just go back one day would have told our spouses or children or parents we love them, we wish that we didn\u2019t go to bed angry. It is very easy and natural for us to treat others how they treat us. Some of us are taught this at a young age. However, the challenge for people is to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d and regardless of what a person did or didn\u2019t do or said or didn\u2019t say, to be able to go above and be kind and understanding thus not being distracted by that person\u2019s behavior or letting them dictate how we respond. Also, we all want to be accepted. It is natural to feel good when you have been recognized or accepted by someone or a group, to the extent at times that one will sacrifice his/her moral code to obtain it. ",

            "answer_text": "Ideologies, movements.I\u2019ve noticed that, more often than not, movements and ideologies who involve massive quantities of people, and their number begin to increase drastically, the initial movement purpose or ideology on which the behaviors of that group of human beings are based, begins to change and the control over the situation is worser. This is possible probably because, if more people are being involved in a movement, the higher is the possibility that it will be reshaped by the same members of that movement or ideology, something over which the original proposer of that idea, has not anymore control over. 2. \u201cRacism\u201d among differences about anything. This isn\u2019t valid only for physical differences, but conflicts between ideologies, ideas, what\u2019s better, what isn\u2019t, which glasses are better, is Pepsi worse than Coca-Cola, is a Christian or Atheist better and a variety of every possible difference about anything. People argue. That\u2019s common. People discuss, and that\u2019s common. But for anything in this world, there is always a human expression that decides what is better and what is worser. 3. Projections and counter-projections at the infinite. The title explains it simply. Anyone who\u2019s aware of this psychological behavior knows that projections happens very often, if not always, positively assuming positive characteristics of someone else or negatively projecting internal negative characteristics on others, narcissists or not. Anyone likes when there is someone who reflects what does she/like and affirms his/her viewpoint. 4. People who become mentally ill, were once sane, but were damaged by people who now walk freely in society, while people who are now mentally ill, stay trapped in a psychiatric institution. As such, mentally ill people are institutionalized only when they push an agenda that isn\u2019t positively correlated with economical benefits. See how wide-spreaded are flat-earthers, extraterrestrial government and others extreme conspiracy theories, that affect other weak minds to be subjugated in a massive psychotic delusion. When they say that psychological illness can be diffused as a pandemic trough air, it\u2019s true. Those who come pure in this world, will be probably damaged by the impurities of accumulated present days of others. Good people are those who suffer for the survival of evil, not the opposite. 5. Ignorance is choosen, not unintentional. Anything in this world that happens to succeed, is because someone knows more than those who fail to realize it. Exploitation of ignorance is the top factor for huge wealth. Ignorance is choosen for individual happiness, because if knowledge is seeken, happiness will disappear. 6. There are laws that are ethically wrong and right, and illegal activities that are ethically right and wrong, even if not formalized by no-one of any nation. 7. We all know wars are evil. No sane human being would ever go to war if he did choose the path of knowledge. (\u201cIgnorance is death.\u201d) 8. Dumbing down overthinking, is a practice of lazy minds. Overthinking is labeled as such, only by those people who don\u2019t think. 9. The fear of being alone made people wear masks. 10. No genius, or humankind\u2019s \u201csavior\u201d, lived a life without being himself, which equals loneliness. A price payed to save ignorant minds from themselves. 11. Wars are fought by people who risk their lifes, for people who own too much. 12. No movement and no ideology is right as long as it puts people against each other. 13. Utopias are possible, human beings are the problem. Human beings can, but they don\u2019t want to. ",

            "answer_text": "That would probably be looking for sense of security, send of control, sense of safety. The most common pattern of individual behaviors emerge for that need. Its more precious to humans that air we breath. e.g. far more people drown because of panic than by loosing all air, or technicality speaking they accelerate the process of drowning because they feel they are loosing control. This emotional need for sense of control is so common because its so deeply necessary for us humans. Look at any human behaviors and that is the most common pattern you will find, a need for control and endless ways we humans try to achieve it. I know you used the word \u201cbehavior\u201d in your question, but I will expand on it by saying that techniques are all over the place, but the pattern is found in the principle (humans need to feel they are in control to feel safe, and that is our primary emotional concern.) and therefore most common human behaviors emerge from that emotional need.

Otherwise, mankind invented rules and standards to live by that would effect/affect our patterns of behavior. Yet, one common natural and basic instinct survived and is still the most common among human behavior and that is \u201cfight or flight\u201d The problem is, humanity has forgotten how to properly react or decide upon said instinct.

For instance, the failure to introduce one\u2019s self or nearby family, friends, or associates to others says a great deal about how the speaker feels about both parties. Sensing the gaps in relations, breaches of cause and effect, blockage and obstruction, and tolerance for disrespect tells that trouble exists. So, I sense what\u2019s not being said, and what is not being done to combine to explain the real reasons that things are about to fail in the natural path of success. If a restaurant doesn\u2019t supply a menu, there is a reason why they don\u2019t want to serve you. I usually consider leaving when that happens, because servers know when the kitchen is wrong.

Except\u2026they're not, they were actually laughing about something in their life. To them, you're the jerk, and they have a reason.

I kept contacting the doctors and they all were telling me they had not received their renewals. I decided it was time to contact the medical board to verify that the doctors had renewed and were legally practicing their professions. The answer I got was that they had moved their office and were working out of boxes because the prison was on lockdown. I was told that the State requires all State offices to get furnishings through the prison and because of the lockdown, no furniture was being made or distributed! They were giving verbal provisional renewals until such time as they got furniture and could set the office up for the work they did. It took awhile for me to digest this information and then I had to laugh, thinking that doctors were working without a hard copy of their medical license because some prisoners had misbehaved! I contacted my counter part at hospitals who had been calling for the licenses and some were willing to take my word that I had contacted the medical board and some thought the story was too far out and called the board to get the \u201cfacts.\u201d ",
