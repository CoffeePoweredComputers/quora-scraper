            "answer_text": "Dear Mr. Faroque, In my opinion,product cycle depends upon the production of certain products and life achieved before putting a new product in its place. This is the benchmark for an engineering product. For consumer goods it's the perception of the customers about the product. Few people would state that the product has given good life looking again into the perception of an individual. A good example should be the tyres used in 2 wheelers or 4 wheeler. ",
