            "answer_text": "Sinkholes are caused by water eroding the rocks below the surface, leading the the collapse and sinking of the overlying rocks/sediments/soil. The erosion can be due to the flowing action of the water or more likely, mildly acidic rainwater dissolving carbonate rocks such as limestone or evaporites. Acidic rainwater forms from the combination of rain water and carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid. Sinkholes are more likely in areas with underground networks of shallow caves with flowing water or underground mine workings that have not been properly supported to prevent collapses. ",

            "answer_text": "Sinkholes can form chemically or mechanically: (1) Chemically formed sinkholes: Normal atmospherically equilibrated rainwater has a pH that is slightly acid and chemically undersaturated with respect to mineral species. When rainwater falls on soil or bedrock, the water will percolate into the substrate or, if the substrate is water saturated (like a wet sponge), water will run off the landscape in surface drainages. Regardless of the route (infiltration or surface runoff), the water will immediately begin to equilibrate (chemically and physically) with the substrate.  In the process, some mineral matter will be dissolved.  Landscapes that are dominated by carbonate or evaporite bedrock (at or just below the surface) are most susceptible to chemical dissolution because of their primary mineralogy (calcite, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, or halite).  What is unique about sinkholes is that sinkholes are the end result of focused flow of water (surface and subsurface).  Hence, sinkholes are features on the landscape where preferential dissolution of the bedrock has occurred due to focused flow of water.  The focusing of the flow can be due to pre-existing joints, faults, or fractures in the bedrock, or collapse of weakened strata into underground caverns created by earlier, past subsurface dissolution of bedrock. If you examine a topographic map of Kentucky in the areas of Mammoth Cave or around Bowling Green, the alignment of sinkholes (areas of depression) is suggestive of the role of joints, faults, and fractures in focusing fluid flow to create sinkholes.   I have noticed (based on news reports) that new sinkholes tend to open up more frequently in areas that have experienced an extensive period of drought followed by a rainy period (such as in Florida a few years back). Why? During drought, the watertable drops and layers of limestone, no longer buoyed up by (presence of) water, become more susceptible to mechanical failure (fracturing due to a relative increase in overburden or burial pressures).  With the end of a drought, focused flow returns to the landscape and new sinkholes appear in locations containing these new subsurface physical weakness. In reality, a sinkhole formed chemically can develop in any type of rock, including granite, if focused flow of water has chemically removed enough mineral matter to weaken the rock.  However, since igneous and metamorphic rocks are not as chemically soluble as sedimentary rocks (like limestone), frequencies of occurrence of sinkhole development in igneous and metamorphic rocks are much lower.  (2) Mechanically formed sinkholes: Another \"type\" of sinkhole is associated with \"piping\", a form of erosion. Piping develops in landscapes dominated by poorly consolidated mudstones, particularly in \"badlands\".  The \"pipes\" form in the near subsurface along joints and natural fractures in the bedrock.  The pipes develop and grow by physical erosion and transport of suspended clays and silts - liberated from the bedrock upon wetting (during rainfall and runoff events). Once these subterranean pipes become large and the overlying roof strata become thinned and weakened, the ground surface can collapse into the cavity.  This collapse forms what many people refer to as a \"sinkhole\".  Here is a link to a USGS website that discusses the \"Science of Sinkholes\"!  http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/the-science-of-sinkholes/  ",

            "answer_text": "According to Google Trends, searching for the term \"sinkhole\" is definitely increasing, and this generally indicative of the real world increase in the term searched for. I.e, I think sinkholes are becoming rapidly more common.   So on the above graph you can see a rapid and continuous increase over time for the last ten years. There is a particular step increase in 2010 and another in 2007. As a student of trends, the above trend is odd. Geology isn't supposed to change, ever. This points to manmade causes, and I think that's pretty much a 99% certainty. The most plausible manmade cause that would show a trend like this is that sinkholes are a hoax. Given the huge amount of money generated online solely by click-through advertising, there is a large potential motivating factor. The same goes for photoshopped pictures of extraordinarily large muscles, unfathomably huge animals, and so on. Questions you could ask are: are there eyewitnesses to these? Are the pictures suitably individual or potentially copied and digitally manipulated from one legitimate image? What kind of news sites are running the stories, and are they known for good reporting? The following trend shows that the adoption of Facebook and Twitter could be driving the step changes seen in 2007 and 2010.   Secondly, the term \"sinkhole\" could simply be a new term for an old phenomenon. This seems less likely as one would expect to have seen these holes on the news in decades previous. Third. Could be that in the past districts kept sinkholes quiet because talking openly about it would damage the local economy and lower house prices. The invention of social media would make cover ups impossible. Seems quite a likely. Fourth. Some kind of new weapon, either space ray or underground. Fifth. Fracking.    Seems a pretty close correlation. ",

            "answer_text": "One Word. Erosion.  You should always assume that erosional processes are going on with water and wind being the primary causes. Normally, erosion can be classified into two categories, depending on the speed of the erosion. You could be looking at a natural, long term progression of erosional processes that can be managed by smart land management alone or a more dangerous accelerated erosion. For a sinkhole to open up, erosion would be happening sub-surface, which can only be detected by tonal changes by looking at aerial photography or satellite imagery. Subtle vegetation changes or a new type of sediment that shows up are also telltale signs that sub-surface erosion is active.  With a sinkhole you could get accelerated erosion activity that is too quick to control, and could have an anthropogenic influence to it. An alignment of sinkholes in a non-geometric shape would indicate a natural type of erosion, but if it looks too straight and unnatural trust your instinct. It probably has man-made origins. In residential areas, the micro-surface features of the landscape are masked by the anthropogenic modification, and it becomes nearly impossible to notice the tiny depressions on the surface until a catastrophic failure occurs such as a sinkhole.

To make one, FIRST you have to make a space for things to fall INTO, so usually you find sinkholes in the same area where you find caves - typically, where the rock below the surface is limestone, or some other relatively easily dissolved rock material. Plain rainwater is acidic enough to dissolve - slowly, slowly, bit by bit - limestone rock. Eventually you can create larger spaces of empty (dissolved away) areas - \u2018caves\u2019. This is a common kind of scenario for solution collapse, and a sinkhole is basically a cave where the roof has fallen in. Eventually, that kind of area CAN get to the point where it is MOSTLY collapsed spaces with only a few remaining \u2018pillars\u2019 standing, and we get a \u2018karst landscape\u2019 (Karst is the term for an area with many caves and sinkholes). And I basically only answered this so I could post a really neat picture of karst:  South China images of karst landscapes:     What you are seeing here, is a landscape where the CURRENT flat land, is the BOTTOM of old sinkholes, which have become so numerous that the area is almost entirely collapsed - and the original land surface used to be somewhere above the tops of the \u2018hills\u2019. Karst is cool. ",

            "answer_text": "I answered a similar question that made reference to the state of Florida specifically. I'll paste that answer at the end. Generally, sinkholes occur where there is a combination of mobile subterranean water relatively near the surface, and some degree of solubility in the rock through which it flows.  Much of Florida is extremely close to, if not at, sea level. This gives rise (pun intended) to a high water table relative to the land surface. Subterranean water is not sitting still; it flows, and the level rises and falls based on a variety of factors not wholly relevant to the discussion. In addition to being very close to sea level, much of the land mass of Florida happens to be composed of carbonate rock, which is somewhat soluble in water. This means that it will dissolve slowly over time. So the carbonate rock under the surface dissolves into the rock, and the subsurface water flows. This, over time, increases the porosity, or sponginess, of the water under the surface. Now the water can flow more easily along these dissolving channels. By the familiar process of erosion, more and more of the carbonate rock is dissolved as water continually flows through it, until there is literally an underwater cavern. Networks of these caverns form over time. I previously mentioned that the subsurface water level (water table) rises and falls. If the water table falls below these caverns, they are no longer \"underwater\" and the lithostatic pressure of the surrounding rock can collapse into them more easily than if water were supporting that pressure. Think of this as almost like a mine shaft collapsing. Gravity dictates that when the cavern collapses, the material above it will crash down into it. Unfortunately for Floridans, homes and roads are the \"material above\"  ",

            "answer_text": "They tend to occur where either there has been a lot of mining and some passages collapse, or where the local underlying rock is limestone. The reason is simple rain with disolved carbon dioxide (and humic acid in peaty areas) is a weak acid which can react with the limestone to release carbon dioxide and water leaving a more soluble salt Calcium BiCarbonate making the residual rock slightly more soluble. This over time seeps down joints and along bedding planes to disolve tube which can become an underground stream . The water enlarges this indefinitely until a cave and then a cavern may form. At the enlargement continues the roof may start to cave in. Often there are layers above this some of which are poorly consolidated and it is there that a sudden collapse can make some sinkholes open rather suddenly. Big Cavern can collapse directly particularly if they are completely flooded. The Florida Sinkholes happen in both areas with weak overlain strata and flooded big caverns. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends more or less of WHERE the sink hole occurs. In the vast majority of cases, They occur in regions where the underlying rock is limestone. Limestone reacts with the acidity of rain over time. Consider this chemical reaction between sulfuric acid (present in much of acid rain) and Calcium carbonate which is limestone. CaCO3 + H2SO4 --->Ca(2+) + SO4(2-)+H2O+CO2This shows the dissolving of the limestone. This results in calcium ion, sulfate, water and carbon dioxide gas, meaning we no longer have rock, just dissolved ions, water and gas. Over long periods of time (because acid rain is relatively weak compared to lab-grade Sulfuric acid), the acid rain absorbs into the ground and compromises the structure of the limestone layer beneath, causing the ground above to collapse in. However, as the concentration of acid rain increases from pollution, you can expect to see the frequency of sinkholes increase. Ever notice why sinkholes are more common in Florida? Because at one point in Florida's geologic history is was one big reef! meaning almost all of its underlying rock is limestone. ",

            "answer_text": "With eustatic sea level changes (rise and fall) the depositional environments for sedimentary rocks also change. The geology of Florida is a perfect example of this. Florida is essentially an exposed carbonate shelf. In order for limestone to form you need an environment in which the zooplankton (foraminifera, who\u2019s shells comprise massive pelagic limestone) can thrive. This would be a shallow, warm water environment with little clastic sedimentary influence from rivers. Foraminifera thrive in waters such as these. As they die their shells collect on the sea floor and over time forms limestone. If sea level drops that depositional environment would move further offshore. Now the area that previously supported the foraminifera is a depositional environment that is characterized by estuaries, rivers and creeks. With this comes more clastic sediments and the formation of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. Should sea level rise again the shallow, warm waters that support the foraminifera would be prevalent and limestone would be deposited on top of the sandstone, siltstone and mudstone that the estuaries, rivers and creeks deposited. Within the geological time frame eustatic sea level changes are a regular occurrence. So the lithology of an area like Florida would have alternating beds of limestone and sandstone. Now the part groundwater has in the formation of sinkholes is considered. Both limestone and sandstone can be excellent aquifers where tremendous amounts of water can be held within the pore space between the grains of the rock. However limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO3) dissolves in the presence of acid. As precipitation falls on the surface and it leaches downward it picks up constituents from the atmosphere and decaying plant matter that make it a week carbonic acid. So over time the limestone will dissolve and create subterranean caverns and caves. The clastic sedimentary rocks like sandstone do not weather in this way and typically stay intact. So it\u2019s easy to see how a \u201cbridge\u201d of sandstone could very easily be over the top of one of these subterranean voids. Over time the sandstone becomes weak and will collapse in on these voids. This is exacerbated by the human development of buildings and streets which adds weight and vibration to these sandstone \u201cbridges\u201d. When it gives way, you get a sinkhole.    ",

Drainage leaks from a single house is IMO unlikely to cause a major sinkhole but a leak in the combined drainage from a small housing estate or a city block may just create a new sinkhole or make an existing one big enough to be hazardous.

Reasons for the earth disappearing could be multiple reasons like: water pulled out for irrigation, mining and oil drilling. And the earth could be frozen beneath then a fast thaw might leave an empty space. And change of an underground river, rain and texture of the ground below a sink hole. Someway, the earth was moved to a different location leaving a void which caved in after stress on the ground above! Earthquake, explosion could be a factor! ",

            "answer_text": "Sinkholes most often happen in areas underlaid by limestone rock. Rain is naturally mildly acidic; when this rain soaks into the ground, it reacts with and partially dissolves the limestone. This produces caves. Caves gradually move upward, as rocks break loose from the cave's roof and collect as a pile on the floor of the cave. Eventually, the layers of rock between the cave and the surface collapse, forming a sinkhole. The same phenomenon happens on a smaller scale when a buried pipe leaks. The leaking water washes away dirt, finally causing a collapse at the surface. ",

As we take more and more water out of wells, the aquifers which had been made of both rock and water, effectively lose much of their mass.
