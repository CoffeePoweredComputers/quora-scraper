            "answer_text": "RETHINK - BLACK HOLES What the common term \" BLACK HOLE \" is referring to is a \" HOLE \" at the center of a Galaxy which has a gravitation intensity so strong that nothing can escape. That is wrong. At the center of Galaxies the \" CORE STAR (S) \" do not emit enough light be seen against the brightness of it's surroundings. I prefer to call them \" GALACTIC CORE STARS \". Thy are not black at any time of their existence. There may also be circumstances where the galactic core is a formation with no firm boundaries, just a jumble of gravity, energy, and matter be pulled in all directions by the gravitational forces surrounding it. Some people have related the look and formation of Galaxies to \" TORNADO\u2019S, HURRICANES, CYCLONES \" with a \" CALM EYE \" at their center. They conclude that the \" CALM EYE \" they think lies at the core of Galaxies to be a \" BLACK HOLE \". However, Galaxies are based on gravitation, and there is \" NO \" calm eye at their core. Carbon and iron comprise the major portion of a star's surface after has used up all or most of it's available fuel. \" MOST \" of the electromagnetic spectrum would be absorbed, and not be reflected or radiated from most of the surface. However, every type of energy known and matter has been detected being ejected from the poles. There may also be circumstances where the galactic core is a formation with no firm boundaries, just a jumble of gravity, energy, and matter be pulled in all directions by the gravitational forces surrounding it. The \" HOTTER \" something gets, the greater is the intensity of energy. Like a carbon filament in a light bulb - ( i.e. it glows. ) - taking into account the entire electromagnetic spectrum. The gravitational intensity at the core of galaxy's would \" NOT \" be strong enough to retain all of the energy types being generated - keep in mind gravity is the weakest of the forces. The energies surrounding a \" CORE STAR (S) \" at the center of galaxies would have an energy buildup extending millions of miles. That is far beyond gravity's ability to retain it - ( i.e. the energy escapes. ). Back to the color of a Galaxy Core Star (s) - the color would be bright and probably white or close to it depending on it's composition, but not black. http://www.creationoftheuniverse.org/ For more info on how the process started.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to keep things simple here, and just use a Newtonian frame of reference. What I mean is that we\u2019re not invoking Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity just yet, and just talking about simple motion through space with a fixed frame of reference. In this sense, do black holes move? Of course they do. In fact there is such a thing called rogue black holes. And yes, it is as scary as it sounds. It\u2019s essentially a black hole, moving through space, at a fierce velocity. Hunt Is On for 'Rogue' Black Holes Remember, black holes aren\u2019t magic, they behave under the same laws of physics, right up to the singularity. At the singularity, all laws of physics break down, or we\u2019re just plain dumb stupid as to what happens. Both possibilities are true here. That\u2019s a field that\u2019s being studied, so for now we\u2019ll regard it as a weird thing that happens. Let\u2019s now invoke Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. Take a black hole. Take a stationary observer. Accelerate them away from the black hole at 10 m/s, and ask them what they see. They\u2019ll see a black hole moving away from them at 10 m/s. Most people will cry foul and say the observer is moving, not the black hole. However, in relativity, each inertial frame of reference is just as valid, including stationary, both moving away, and only one moving away. The math on each count will yield the same answer, because Einstein demonstrated that there is no frame of reference that should be given special treatment. In other words, if we can define a thing as something moving with respect to an object, the object itself can also be defined as moving with respect to said thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes move relative to other things in the Universe. We have observed the radiation emitted by their rapid spin. The massive star that forms a black hole due to gravitational collapse after it consumes all its fusionable material was spinning before it began to supernova. As it collapses, that rotational momentum is concentrated, just as an ice dancer's spin increases when they pull their arms and legs in close to their center or rotation. The very rapid rotation of a central black hole appears to be what powers the enormous emission of radiation from a quasar. See: Movement of black holes powers the universe\u2019s brightest lights, study finds.  Black holes also move in relation to the galaxy containing them just as the star that underwent gravitational collapse to form them moved before its nuclear fuel went out and it fell inward into itself. Finally, the galaxies move relative to one another, and most galaxies--our Milky Way included--contain a supermassive black hole that the entire galaxy is orbiting about. The Milky Way and our nearest neighboring galaxy, Andromeda, are currently moving toward each other. They are 2.2 million light years apart now, but they will collide in about 4 billion years and their supermassive black holes will merge.  ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! Absolutely. Black holes move just like all other matter in the universe. I know, it\u2019s odd to think about; A hole moving. Not only can they move, they can move FAST. Really, really fast. Millions of miles per hour fast. Most black holes start moving this fast as a result of a collision or a near-miss with another black hole.  As black holes move throughout space, they gobble up just about anything they can. The size of the black hole is irrelevant. All black holes can move, even the supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. Black holes also spin. Also, really fast. They can spin at near light speed. Because they spin so fast, they can distort space-time around them. Making a new odd layer of black holes called the Ergosphere. Anatomy of a spinning black hole:  Here is this nice animation to help explain the ergosphere and its uses a bit more: The Black Hole Bomb and Black Hole Civilizations Sources: Does a black hole move through space?

Step 1: Locate the black hole Step 2: Walk towards it (or in any direction)Step 3: Congratulate yourself, the black hole is now moving through space. It is utterly wrong, a deep misunderstanding of physics, to think the preceding is a gimmick, that it\u2019s really you that is moving and not the black hole. Such was the error of Aristotle and the foundation upon which classical mechanics and relativistic physics was built. Relative motion is a deep seated illusion, one that perhaps formed during hominid evolution on the savannas of Africa where the land and mountains were seen to be in a state of absolute rest, or perhaps even deeper, the mental schema used by organisms to have an intuitive map of there environment. In addition it should be noted that all free-fall objects, black holes, wormholes, Quora writers, and tennis balls, all follow the geodesics of the spacetime. A black hole and a star would orbit their center of mass just as the Earth and Moon do and there is nothing special or different about a black hole\u2019s motion than there is with anything else. ",

To be precise, motion is relative, that means when there is no reference point, you cannot judge whether the object is moving or stationary. For example, consider yourself at a point x in the space and this is the reference point. If you move say 5 feet from point x, for an observer it looks that you have moved 5 ft because they are measuring the distance from reference point x to you. But assume there is no point of reference x and assume after you move, x has also been moved 5 feet. Now that both X and you are at the same point. For a person looking, it will be like you are stationary. ",

Most stars orbit something. So when the star collapses into a black hole, the black hole will continue orbiting the same thing what the star was orbiting. Everything inside our galaxy orbits the center of our galaxy - which is a supermassive black hole (hundreds of thousands to billions of solar masses), which has an enormous gravitational pull. Which over powers a normal black holes gravitational pull. That is why black holes remain in galaxies.  For details check out  www.hawking.org.uk/into-a-black-hole.html",

But now we know that black holes, specially those with a rotation move across our galaxy and by that account also our universe. Those moving black holes are extremely dangerous mainly because of one thing. If they come too close to another source of gravity they are attracted towards it. So if one of those black holes moving through our galaxy comes too close to our solar system\u2026 Well. We can basically say goodbye to the human race. Because there's no way we could stop it from tearing our solar systems to shreds. With a bit of good luck or bad luck, you decide\u2026 What could happen would be that our planet would be drawn to the black hole event horizon, but we'd slingshot from it without falling into it. Of course that would mean our planet would basically be set loose on the universe. A rogue planet moving through space to god only knows where. ",

I know how a black hole is created, or how it's said a black hole is created, and there is no reason the creation of a black hole isn't because of a rip in space, especially since we don't know much about much, and if as a lot of theorists say there are multi dimensions and so on. It's very possible I'm way off, but it's very possible that I'm correct, and if I end up somewhere in the middle of both I'm ok with that also ",

Like for example, if its small-mid size black hole in a galaxy, it will be bound to the gravity of the super-massive black hole at the center and will revolve about it (just like our sun does). If its a super-massive black hole at the galactic center, they too will be in motion with respect to other galaxies. ",
