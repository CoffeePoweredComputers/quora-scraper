            "answer_text": "The question should be answered with your personal and career objectives in mind. I'm sure there are various interpretations, but in my experience, cognitive science is a very (academic) research oriented major best fit to students planning to do graduate studies in that field. As interesting as the topic is to just about everyone, it might be a tough sell by itself looking for employment, especially compared to a computer science degree. It's much easier to explain to a potential employer how your experience building JavaScript frameworks, some machine learning work, and making a few APIs is applicable to a company's goals than a little trick you learned to do in statistics software for applying your regression or ANOVA analysis to a dataset so you could tell if some mostly white, male undergrads were more or less sympathetic depending on the color shirt you wore. But I digress. Let's get back to why cognitive science education differs from computer science, in my experience. There are night and day differences in how computer science and cognitive science approach teaching programming. The latter is concerned mainly with the application of programming to data analysis and statistical testing, hence its much heavier emphasis on languages like R and MATLAB (and more recently, Python), plus special statistics packages like SPSS and SAS. Less emphasis is placed on understanding how these tools work than what problems they should be applied to and when. By contrast, computer science programs usually start by introducing freshmen to a 'base' language (traditionally C++ or Java, increasingly Python), and after a semester or two of experience and confidence building, delve into how these languages are made and how they manipulate data (structures). The aim is usually for the students' experience to be applicable to any software problem, not just scientific question answering. There's also a greater emphasis in computer science on making code that's 'good,' which usually means reusable and built on in your later projects. I know several biologists and cogscis who start from scratch with each new analysis, instead of putting in the effort to make what their code maintainable, through version control and all that stuff. I don't completely agree with Robbert Hofman's answer. At least for research, it's true that a solid background in mathematics greatly enhances any cognitive science pursuit, especially with the growing awareness of statistics being done incorrectly in many publications. That said, there's a difference between being able to prove a theorem, crunching numbers by hand, and knowing how to implement that formalism into a working script. Doing the statistics by hand for most datasets these days is nearly intractable. Bottom line, your future boss will be employing you, not your major or your school. It's unlikely your major program will prevent you from getting experience in the related fields, and the faculty will probably cross paths frequently, so the choice of major really just changes who you have to report your progress to. Computer science may be preferred in some industries, but it's the skills, experience, and recommendations that'll determine employability. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly I have to admit that, after completing a master degree in Cognitive Science at Lund University, Sweden, I am still unable to fully understand the actual scope and main goals of this highly versatile interdiscipline field. It involves so vast a scope, including computer science, AI, robotics, neurology, psychology, philosophy, linguistics... or everything you can think of about the human brain and the human mind (or artificial versions of these). One just need to look at the list of topics chosen for individual master theses in my class. It was so diverse that we were like studying in totally different fields -- AI automatic car parking, fashion design, animal cognition, eye tracking for computer UI, and my topic, a human neurological condition called synesthesia. To me the Cog Sci master is some kind of personal interest and not to boost my career (my bachelor was in Computer Science). But it seems the most successful student in my class, in terms of utilizing what's learnt in class to future career, is the one who focuses on eye tracking and UI design. He made use of the eye tacking facilities in the university and developed a simple UI where you can select drop-down menus and click buttons using your eyes. After the master he went to Stanford, and now he is one of the founder of The Eye Tribe, a start-up company in Copenhagen that uses eye tracking technology on mobile computing and gaming. [edit 2017: recently his company has been acquired by Facebook] So it seems to me that Cog Sci is very useful to a technology related career. The two trendy paths: UI and AI. The main difference with Computer Science as I see is that, Cog Sci (on the technological side) is more on exploring innovative and futuristic ideas, and Comp Sci is more on utilizing existing technologies and building powerful applications. Of course you can explore the more scientific aspects of Cog Sci by researching the mysteries of the human brain, like my thesis did, and the same can also be said to Comp Sci, like one of my friend who is doing a PhD in computational music theories here in Hong Kong.
