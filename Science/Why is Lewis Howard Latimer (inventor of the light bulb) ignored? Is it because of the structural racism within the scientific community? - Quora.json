            "answer_text": "Much more likely to be because although he was as much an inventor of the light bulb as any of about 2 dozen people none of them were THE inventor. Various electric light bulbs existed before his work on an improved carbon filament for such bulbs allowed him to gain a patent in 1882, 80 years after Davy first demonstrated an electric incandescent light. Latimer was involved with Alexander Graham Bell\u2019s telephone patent having been a draftsman employed by his patent agent, this seems to have started his interest in electricity and (and this is a further clue to him not being THE inventor of the electric light bulb) he went to work for the U.S. Electric Light Company, Hiram Maxim\u2019s vehicle for developing electric lighting. Maxim found there was a lot more money to be made from arms but he had lots of electrical inventions including the light bulb, Eventually the company became part of General Electric (the US company not the British GEC) where Latimer continued to work in the legal department.Eventually he became a successful consultant to patent law firms. Most Americans believe that Edison invented the light bulb, most Brits believe Swann did, I\u2019m sure other countries credit others, what Latimer most certainly did do was to write the first book on electric lighting.

            "answer_text": "Lewis Howard Latimer was not the inventor of the light bulb. He was the inventor of a better way to produce carbon filaments that Edison used to make light bulbs that were long lasting and inexpensive enough to be sold to the public at large. And the scientific community has nothing to do with Latimer\u2019s obscurity with the public at large. It\u2019s mostly a product of Edison\u2019s relentless self-promotion which obscured people like Joseph Swan who figured out that creating a partial vacuum would make the filaments last longer, and Warren de la Rue who invented the bulb itself. Edison was the first to bring a functional light bulb to market and he wasn\u2019t overly inclined to celebrate the contributions of employees like Latimer to the creation of \u201chis\u201d inventions. Latimer\u2019s contribution to light bulbs going into mass production when they did was substantial, but he is one of many people who contributed to Edison\u2019s success without being remembered for it. And the reason why his name and not theirs has come into some slight prominence these days is because he was black. ",
