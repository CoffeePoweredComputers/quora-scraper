            "answer_text": "Is organic chemistry a better option for pre-med than biomedical science? I don\u2019t know what your college\u2019s \u201cbiomedical science\u201d curriculum contains. If it is only a one- or two-semester course, it sounds like a very superficial treatment of many topics \u2014 probably including a superficial introduction to organic chemistry \u2014 that will not prepare you for the MCAT or other related professional aptitude tests. I won\u2019t pretend that all the content of a majors\u2019 course in organic chemistry will come back useful in a medical career, but a great deal of it is preparation for biochemistry, which is central to medicine, and which you will see again in your first-year professional curriculum. You need that. Further, the way of thinking \u2014 and learning \u2014 that are necessary for you to be successful in organic chemistry are very much echoed by a medical school curriculum. If you can\u2019t hack OChem, you might want to rethink your future plans. ",

No one is a \u201cpre-med\u201d major. \ud83d\ude31You have to major in something substantial and which is offered by your school. One doesn't need to be a science major to get into medical school, but you should have some science background and a degree which will earn you a living should you not get accepted. Medical Technology, Nursing, Biochemistry, Pharmacy are great careers to pursue for admission. They will also acquaint one with the medical side before applying for medical school. Organic chemistry will be part of the classes required with those majors. \ud83c\udf83 ",
