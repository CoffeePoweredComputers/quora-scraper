            "answer_text": "You may want to either edit, instead of copy and paste, or provide the free body diagram.  This is a right triangle showing F1 = 65 N at 58 degrees above the horizontal. The horizontal side of this triangle is adjacent to the 58 degree angle. Using the SOHCAHTOA mnemonic, solve for the adjacent side. If you are unfamiliar with right angle trigonometry, it has to be in your textbook or some other resource available to you. This calculated value for the adjacent side of this triangle is the only force that is acting in the horizontal axis, so this must be the net force. ",

What is the net force in the x-direction? Answer: Given: A force = 65 N is applied to a box at an angle 58 degrees above horizon. To find net force in the horizontal direction or x -axis(x) : cos(58) = x/65 65( cos(58)) = 34.44475218 N or approximately 34 N >>>>>>>>>>approximately 34 N ",
