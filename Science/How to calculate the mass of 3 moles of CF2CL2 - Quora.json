            "answer_text": "In order to calculate the mass of one mole of a molecule, we must simply find the atomic weight of each atom in that molecule, multiply each by the number of times it appears, and add them all together. I would assume the reason you are asking this question is because you do not truly understand what is happening during this process, so before we go through everything, let\u2019s clarify what it all means. On the periodic table, every element is given an atomic weight, which is the average mass of that element on Earth. That might sound confusing, but just think of this number as how much one atom of the element weighs. Notice that this number is given in atomic mass units (amu). Atomic mass units are very small, and therefore capable of describing the masses of atoms without using needed huge negative exponents as one would have to with grams. Now let\u2019s talk about moles. The only purpose for using moles in a problem like this is because a single atom is incredibly difficult to work with. Instead, people prefer to use small lumps of atoms which can fit comfortably in the palm of their hands. So, at its core, a mole is simply a number of atoms which makes thinking about them much easier. In fact, a mole was chosen to be exactly the conversion rate between atomic mass units and the more commonly used grams. This was a clever decision, because it means that if a single atom weighs some number of atomic mass units, one mole of that atom weighs exactly that same number of grams. This means that we can easily use the masses given in atomic mass units on the periodic table, and just by calling them grams instead of amu\u2019s we are suddenly talking about entire moles instead of single atoms. Let\u2019s do this! The periodic table gives us the atomic weights of Carbon (C), Fluorine (F), and Chlorine (Cl): Carbon \u219212.011 amuFluorine \u219218.998 amuChlorine \u219235.450 amuSince the question asks about the molar mass of [math]CF_2Cl_2[/math], which contains a single carbon atom, two flouring atoms, and two chlorine atoms, we add the atomic mass of carbon, twice the atomic weight of fluorine, and twice the atomic weight of chlorine, giving us a total mass of [math]12.011+2\\times18.998+2\\times35.450=120.907amu[/math]. The problem is that we are looking for the mass of an entire mole of [math]CF_2Cl_2[/math], not a single molecule, and so we change the mass from amu\u2019s to grams. The final step is simply to multiply this number by 3, because the question asks us for the mass of 3 moles, not just 1. This multiplication gives us the final answer of 362.721 grams. ",

So you get the molecular weight of Carbon + (2 x Fluorine) + (2 x Chlorine) to get the grams for one mole, then multiply by three. ",
