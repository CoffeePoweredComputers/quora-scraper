            "answer_text": "Intuitively, it's a ruler for abstract sets and you're allowed to break that ruler up into countably many pieces to do the measuring on those countably many subsets that are easily measured.  In normal euclidean space, those easy to measure subsets are intervals or hypercubes, and the measure would be more or less Lebesgue. ",

            "answer_text": "A measure is simple yet profound, and you can understand it by adopting the Grand Topological Basis of math.  When one drops the preposterous ideas of sets and set theory, as It's pure haberdash, the necessary ideas behind measure theory of math become clear. Consider the Topology of a point. Now consider the negation of that topology. Take the Cantor Union over all points of all the negated topologies -- this is a measure. Pure and simple. ",
