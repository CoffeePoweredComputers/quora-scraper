            "answer_text": "Wow there is a lot of disparity on the answers for this one! First, regarding the atmosphere: Some planets rotate much faster than Earth (Jupiter) and some much slower (Venus).  Both of these have massively thick atmospheres.  Mars, which rotates at roughly the same rate as the Earth has very little atmosphere.  So I disagree with the answers that are saying the Earth's atmosphere would redistribute or radically alter in some way.  Earth once rotated much faster than it now does, and it had a thick atmosphere at that time.  As it slowed down, it maintained its atmosphere.  My bet is that a 1/3rd slowing would temporarily shake up the atmosphere, but not redistribute it in any long term way. Second, regarding temperature:  I don't there'd be much difference here, either.  There are places were it is dark for months at a time and then light for months at a time.  These places (the poles) are chillier than the rest of the planet, to be sure, but not ridiculously so.  And the sunlight they do get is very weak due to the long angles. So while there would be greater cooling at night (though how much remains subject to debate here), there would be greater warming during the day.  This greater warming would drive more powerful winds and storms than we currently have, but these would have the effect of mixing the atmosphere more quickly and thoroughly, which would redistribute the heat.  Also, that increased heat on the daytime side would increase atmospheric humidity levels.  Since water is a greenhouse gas, this would serve to warm the planet.  Again, this would mitigate nighttime cooling. Third, regarding the core:  The rotation of the core is very complex, and not directly tied to the rotation of the Earth as a whole.  We know this because the poles switch their polarity from time to time, and this appears to have nothing to do with the rotation of the Earth.  It's certainly possible that slowing the Earth would reduce the magnetic field, but it would not necessarily do so.  If we just slowed the planet as a whole, the core might continue to spin as it does now - it does have a rather enormous amount of inertia! So, all in all, I would take some of these answers with a grain of salt.  There would certainly be impacts, but what those would be is far from certain. ",

Tjis may impact growing cycles and weather patterns. Etc. If you meant a slower orbital speed then the Earth would move closer to the Sun until our orbital speed matched the gravity of the sun. This could Depending on just what was to become our orbital speed move us into a close proximity to venus. This could involve risks of planetary collision. Effects on tides etc when our proximity to Venus got very close. Or perhaps we would just move a bit closer to the Sun without much effect at all. It would all depend on how much the Earth were to slow down. To much and we might spiral right into the sun. However it is a moote pointvas the Earth isnt abot to slow down. Newtons laws say it wont. Im sticking with Newton. ",

The temperature differences would make the oceans' streams change dramatically. All climate would be affected. Forests could turn to deserts, deserts could start to receive more and more rain and become fertile terrain. Droughts, ice, completely different seasons... Not to mention that a slower rotation could make the sea levels lower near the equator and raise near the poles, as there would be less centrifugal forces applied to the planet's water masses. This very same mechanism could put some stress on the planet's crust, so vulcanism and earthquakes could be possibly expected as well. ",

            "answer_text": "Would it get hotter in the day and colder in night? Yes. How much?  The average temperature on Earth is 15\u00b0C. The temperature amplitude (Max - Min) in a day around where I live is typically 10\u00b0C. It\u2019s less near the sea and more further inland. I live 300 km from the nearest sea so I\u2019m a good average. The average would stay the same and the amplitude would triple. In spring and autumn, we\u2019d freeze every night and have a few hours of beach-worthy temperature every afternoon. Winters would be much more pleasant, freezing past -10\u00b0C at night, but we\u2019d have 20\u00b0C some afternoons. Summers afternoon would average at 35\u00b0C, with the occasional 50, I\u2019m sure. But it\u2019d still be survivable. For us. The relocation of the atmosphere and oceans (due to the Earth bulge not resorbing as fast as them) will already kill off half the biosphere. The temperature extremes will do half of what\u2019s left in. Including 100% of our crops. Our new everyday will also involve much more powerful winds than before because wind is caused by temperature differentials. But, the superstorms we\u2019ll get used to will still feel like nothing compared to the megastorms caused by the slowdown. Not so survivable after all\u2026 ",

But if it is slow then we would not notice it for a long time as we would evolve to compensate it and it's effects. But if it's drastic then first of all the day and night would become much much longer. All the clocks and watches in the world will be useless as 24 hours is no more a day. The climate would be affected as earth rotation has an impact on it. Temperatures will drastically fall and rise at places. I think due to newton's law that objects in motion will stay in motion flooding might occur from oceans.this needs validation. Earthquakes will also happen as fault lines will slam against each other just like we do when we suddenly apply breaks in a car. There will be much more changes for sure but more things are not coming into my mind. I will post when I figure it out. ",
