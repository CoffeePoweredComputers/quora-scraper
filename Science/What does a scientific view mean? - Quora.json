            "answer_text": "This is referring to the fact that there are many ways of understanding something that has been happening around us. The way we see and understand what is happening then largely depends on which skills or intellectual understandings and skills we apply. Thus you could see someone who is \u201c a sick person who always has headaches \u201d but should you particularly choose to see it from a Scientific point of view you may say that there is a quite understandable and Scientifically logical reason medically speaking (medicine being a Science) why that person is always ill. Alternatively if you saw it from a Spiritual point of view, you could say that there is a root spiritual problem in that the person has deep emitional relationship problems that cause tension. ",
