            "answer_text": "Lots. Distance from SunSize and internal heatMagnetic field and internal motion of magmaSo Venus has low magnetic field Earth has a robust magnetic field Mars has a collapsed, non-existent magnetic field. Venus is very hot volcanically but low motion means it has low externalised eruptions, but instead has a high internal heat that finds difficulty escaping. Hence the planet is very hot insulated by a thick atmosphere. So thick that it is only comparable to the pressure 3 km under the sea on earth!! Earth has active internal heat and has escape channels for volcanoes and is a regular feature. Mars has a cooled core which means no more magma activity, no more magnetic field being generated. Atmosphere mostly lost. Venus closest to the sun but sun hardly lights the ground! Earth is nice and sunny. Mars is no Spain. Sun is dimmer and cooler as it is farther away. Just a note. Mercury has a robust magnetic field that means it has some protection from sun even though it is closer. Mercury has internally cooled down compared to Venus. Most of its surface is scorched by proximity to sun. Venus though farther away is hotter because of its own internal heat at its core. Contrary to some myths, the heat of Venus is not due to its atmosphere, or greenhouse effect. It is due to its internal volcanic heat.  The path of masculine Mars above. Below is the beautiful feminine pattern of Venus (as seen from Earth).   Mercury appears to form a rather busy pattern!  Venus shown in a cathedral as a window. Valuing the beauty of Venus through the 5 petalled pentagram symbolises valuing feminity, harmony and beauty in one\u2019s life. Mars symbolises brash masculinity. Thanks for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are a few general differences between the planets Venus and Mars : Venus is hotter than Earth and is the hottest planet in the solar system (hotter than Mercury), Mars is colder than Earth.Venus is the second planet from the Sun , Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. Venus is an inferior planet from Earth, Mars is a superior planet .The astronomical (and astrological) symbol of Mars is the following one (Free image from Wikipedia):  It is the alchemical symbol of iron, the gender symbol for male, and the symbol of the god Ares/Mars . The astronomical (and astrological) symbol of Venus is the following one (Free image from Wikipedia):  This symbol is the alchemical symbol of copper, the gender symbol for female, and the   symbol of the goddess Aphrodite/Venus . Venus has no natural satellite , Mars has two moons .Thick sulfur dioxide clouds cover and obscure the surface of Venus . See the image below (image source : MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging ):   Mars is often called \"the Red Planet\". A large portion of the surface of Mars is covered by iron dust. See image below (image source : Mars Kicks Up the Dust as it Makes Closest Approach to Earth ): Now for some more detailed differences between Venus and Mars : Venus has a similar size to Earth : Venus radius is 6,051.8\u00b11.0 km , about 0.9499 Earths . Mars is smaller with a radius of 3,396.2\u00b10.1 km , about 0.533 Earths.Venus has a mass close to Earth's mass: 4.8675\u00d710^24 kg , about 0.815 Earths . Mars has about 10% the mass of the Earth : 6.4171\u00d710^23 kg , about 0.107 Earths . Mars has about 10000 times less Carbon Dioxide in its atmosphere than Venus.Orbital Period for Venus : 224.701 Earth days , orbital period for Mars :686.98 Earth days (1.88 Earth years) .The surface gravity or the gravitational acceleration on the surface of Venus is approximately 8.87 m/s^2 , whereas the acceleration of gravity on the surface of Mars is about 3.711 m/s^2 .An additional difference between the two planets is that Mars is going to be the first planet to be visited and explored by humans from planet Earth .Some similarities: Neither planet has rings . In the next 20 to 40 million years , Phobos ,the largest moon of Mars , will be torn apart by gravitational forces , resulting in  the creation of a ring which could last up to 100 million years.The structure of the magnetic fields of Mars and Venus are alike.  For both planets the density of the ionosphere at 250 km altitude is similar.For more info about Venus and Mars, see the following links: Venus  Venus Facts - Interesting Facts about the Planet Venus  Mars  Mars Facts - Interesting Facts about the Planet Mars  ",
