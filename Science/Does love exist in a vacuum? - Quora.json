            "answer_text": ">>>Does love exist in a vacuum?<<< Unfortunately you are proclaiming a categorical mis-take: Love and any other emotion/sensation/opinion such as: Space, time, mass, energy, forces, accelerations (such as gravity), laws, G-Ds are undetectable. Love and any other emotion/sensation/opinion such as: Space, time, mass, energy, forces, accelerations (such as gravity), laws, G-Ds are made up TO/ON/OF/ABOUT the material universe. Love and any other emotion/sensation/opinion such as: Space, time, mass, energy, forces, accelerations (such as gravity), laws, G-Ds they do not exist: NOT as SUCH, NOT them-SELVES, NOT on their OWN.Even the measur-ability of space, time, mass, energy forces, accelerations (such as gravity), is NOT tantamount to any detect-ability of space, time, mass, energy, forces, accelerations (such as gravity). All that DOES exist in this respect, WAS invented, DID emerge, is detectable, it is utterations = manifestations = assertions = object-IFICATIONS OF Love and any other emotion/sensation/opinion such as: Space, time, mass, energy, forces, accelerations (such as gravity), laws and G-Ds. The object-IFICATIONS, they are existing, detectable, (quite) permanent, durable, and they [have our brain] elicit, make up, fabricate, fake that Love and any other emotion/sensation/opinion such as: Space, time, mass, energy, forces, accelerations (such as gravity), laws and G-Ds be existing - as such, on their own, them-selves.

            "answer_text": "The perfect vacuum is both eternal (having always existed) and infinite. Love does exist in a vacuum. God is love and his name is Jehovah. The vacuum is the infinite abyss of nothingness. Love exists because God is and always has been and will be love. So, love exists because God exists. He has always existed in the vacuum of nothingness. From there he created all of creation. God is love in the vacuum of nothingness and mankind has love on earth in the vacuum of space. 3) The eternal and infinite dark abyss of the vacuum of nothingness engulfs God who is love.
