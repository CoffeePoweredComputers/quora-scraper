            "answer_text": "The Big Problem with current Black Hole Theory is not that it is wrong. It is that current theory applies to a situation which is quite different from reality. All the formulas and deductions about Schwarzschild Radii and Event Horizons apply to entities which are NOT ROTATING. Real Black Holes ARE ROTATING, and doing so incredibly fast. Many of the explanations of Black Holes do not mention that the theory only applies to stationary objects, although the Wikipedia entry does.  There is a brief summary of the situation at: Is it true that nothing can escape from a Black Hole, not even light? <Is it true that nothing can escape from a Black Hole, not even light?>. This summary is only 10 lines long, so it can be quoted in full here. ================= Q. Is it true that nothing can escape from a Black Hole, not even light? A. Not true. In fact, huge amounts of matter and energy are continually emitted from Real Black Holes, those found in the real Universe. Q. But hasn't it been proved mathematically that nothing can escape from a Black Hole? A. There is such a formula, but it only applies to Concept Black Holes, as envisaged in theory. Q. What's the difference between Real and Concept black holes? A. Concept Black Holes are not rotating. Real Black Holes rotate extremely rapidly. Q. What does the formula say? A. The formula gives the Schwarzschild Radius of the Event Horizon, beyond which nothing in a stationary Black Hole can escape. Q. Where can details of Real Black Holes be found? A. Look at \"XT805: What's inside Real Black Holes?\", at http://www.aoi.com.au/Extracts/XT805.htm . ================= The graphic above depicts a Supermassive Black Hole or AGN, the Active Galactic Nucleus at the centre of each galaxy. Smaller black holes, derived from the expansion/collapse stage of ageing massive stars (many times the mass of our Sun) exist within each galaxy. All are rotating extremely rapidly. It seems that in black holes, which are orders of magnitude denser than neutron stars, their mass is a reflection of their rotational energy. This is a newer concept to grasp -- we know that in atomic nuclei, mass and energy are just different views of the same thing (as with gluons, attractive forces treated as particles). In AGNs, sufficiently large energies will have an expression as mass. There is a more detailed analysis of this scenario at: UG101: Recycling the Universe: Neutron Stars, Black Holes, and the Science of Stuff <http://www.aoi.com.au/Recycling/> .

            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cblack hole theory\u201d. Black holes are predictions of a theory, namely general relativity. The existence of black holes is evident already from the very first solution of the equations of general relativity written down by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916 (though it was not recognized until much later that the solution does, in fact, harbor a black hole.) An explicit mathematical description of how matter can collapse and form a black hole was given by Oppenheimer and Snyder in 1939. We have very little doubt that black holes exist. We have seen stars moving in the gravitational field of an unseen, massive, compact object (including stars that are believed to be orbiting the supermassive black hole near the center of our Milky Way, Sagittarius A*.) We have seen precursors to black holes or things that are almost black holes, such as supernova explosions and neutron stars. We have recently seen gravitational waves from the merger of black holes. We will soon see the \u201cshadow\u201d cast by Sgr A* by a radio telescope as a result of an ongoing effort to image this black hole\u2019s event horizon. A black hole is known, in addition to having an event horizon, to harbor a singularity inside that horizon. Near the singularity, physical variables become divergent. The gravitational field, in particular, becomes extreme, leading many to believe that in this region, Einstein\u2019s gravity does not suffice; we need an (as yet non-existent) quantum theory of gravity to be able to accurately describe this region. So to the extent that something is \u201cwrong\u201d with the prediction of black holes, it\u2019s that the theory may be incomplete. That said, this affects only the extreme environment near the singularity, which we cannot observe anyway, not unless we are foolish enough to jump into the black hole, and even then, the singularity is not a place that you can visit but an unavoidable moment in your future\u2026 So not exactly something that you can observe and tell others about. So perhaps we will never need a \u201ccomplete\u201d theory, since the incomplete theory fully and accurately describes everything we observe. Then again, this incompleteness also affects our ability to describe the extreme early universe, which might have aftereffects that can be detected by detailed cosmological observations. (Not too long ago, just such a detection was announced, the so-called BICEP2 result of polarization in the microwave background due to gravitational waves originating from those very early moments; later, however, this discovery was retracted, as the analysis was flawed and there really was no signal detected.) But none of these mean that the black hole predictions are wrong. They simply mean that, as so many times in the history of science, some predictions are valid across a wide range of parameters, but for extreme parameter values, the theory must be refined or amended.
