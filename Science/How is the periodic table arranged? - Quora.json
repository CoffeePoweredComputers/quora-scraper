            "answer_text": "The first scientist to classify the then know elements was D\u00f6bereiner. He made 3 triads. But there were many limitations to his theory as at that time 30 elements were known and he gave only 3 triads with 3 elements in each. Then came Johann Newland with his \u201cLaw Of Octaves\u201d. He gave his theory that if elements are arranged in increasing number of atomic mass then 8th element after a element will show the same property. But his law also had many disadvantages as he didnt left gaps for the elements that were not known at that time. He was after fame and pride. But pride has a fall and his model got rejected. Then came Dmitri Mendeleev. He also gave his table in increasing number of atomic mass. He also predicted the oxides and hydrides of the element which were not known at that time. He gave a precise periodic table. But his table had so much disadvantages. Henry Moosley gave a law. He gave basis to the new periodic table. He made order out of chaos. He gave atomic number of elements. The modern periodic table is based on the increasing number of atomic number. No one made it but people from different times. Neil Bohr had a big hand in it. ",

            "answer_text": "Periodic table was created by a Russian scientist Dmitry Mendeleev. He noticed that some molecules tended to reoccur, and there was an unexplained pattern of reoccurance. Mendeleev was in the habit of writing the known 65 elements onto cards and playing 'chemical solitaire' on long train journeys. His obsession with investigating of the materials related to each other led him to develop the first periodic table in 1869. The early sketch of periodic table was so insightful that it guided and   accelerated progress in chemistry for the next 150 years. It provided the scaffolding for pragmatic discovery, laying out the basis of what should be. A truly elegant theory gets things right enough to foster progress - from many people only loosely connected (? Like Quora?). Mendeleev's periodic table of elements has been enduring- it is one of the quintessential example of scientists taking something tough and making it brilliant, simple and elegant.
