            "answer_text": "This question should be asked this way: Why does energy \u2260 mass? Energy is not substance; it is the existence state of mass. Energy is a parameter that describes the mass existence state which has the ability to do work --- the degree of freedom of movement of mass. Mass is the only substance of matter, and matter is the abstract term that represent mass with all existence states of it. The substance cannot be exchangeable to or equal with its own existence state. The intrinsic quality and quantity of mass never change, not even in the most extreme conditions in the central black holes --- where only the existence state of mass is changed (changed from position potential locked movement of mass into highest degree of freedom of movement of mass) but mass itself did not change at all. The substance and the existence state of this substance are two different categories of things; things in different categories don\u2019t have comparability, so they cannot be equal or unequal. E = mc\u00b2 is a mathematical equation that only can give quantitative statement but any qualitative statement should be left to physics to make. E = mc\u00b2 means: how much energy this amount of mass m carries at the compounded movement that equivalent to c\u00b2. Note: due to c is the mass movement speed limit, so the c\u00b2 has to be an equivalent of the compounded movements at speed c or near c. Here it means: the structure of this amount of mass m stored the universal structural position potential energy that is equivalent to the compounded movements of c\u00b2. ",

            "answer_text": "By historical artifact. In the opening of the Principia, Sir Isaac Newton defined mass as the amount of matter in an object. Newton had valid reasons for doing so but centuries of physics later we now know that mass is not the matter in the object, but the energy in the object.  So we now have two words, mass and energy, that mean the same thing. This is not as bad as it seems and it works out quite nicely. It turns out that we can use the word \"mass\" to separate the frame dependent dynamics of a system (momentum, kinetic energy) from the object's total internal energy it has at rest and this works out very nicely. Historically this has happened a few times. In thermodynamics both heat and work refer to the same concept, the amount of energy transferred from one system to another. This too has worked out nicely as heat is the quantity of transferred energy that happens by a temperature difference and work is the quantity of energy transferred non-thermally (or equivalently, work is the organized transfer of energy and heat is energy transferred by random thermal motion). In a similar historical example, created by the same principle that resulted in mass being identified as energy, relativity has magnetic field and electric fields being aspects of one unified electromagnetic field.  I would be remiss if I did not point out a subtle difference between historical examples. In the cases of thermodynamics and electromagnetism the quantities involved may refer to the same concept but distinctions can be drawn between them, e.g., work and heat refer to the same concept of energy transfer but the processes are distinct. This is not so for mass and energy, which are fundamentally exactly the same. ",
