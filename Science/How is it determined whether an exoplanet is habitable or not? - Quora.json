            "answer_text": "By calling plants in the habitable zone the astrophysicists mean planets lying in a region at a particular distance from their host star such that the temperature on it is suitable to sustain water in the liquid state, it has a solid surface and appropriate atmosphere and pressure. This is not even nearly to the idea of human habitability. Kepler-186F is said to be in a habitable zone according to the research made in April 2014. This planet was actually seen indirectly i.e. observed by the dip in starlight when it passed from the front of the star after knowing about the properties of the star. This planet is 10% larger in radius than the earth orbiting around the size of mercury around a dim red dwarf star. It is at a distance of 500 light years from the earth. No idea about its mass or atmosphere. But now, NASA announced that the Trappist-1 system has 7 planets in the habitable zone out of which 3 were found to be extremely similar to earth. The could be habitable according to NASA. The spritzer space telescope launched by NASA in 2003 had been giving information about the cool dwarf Trappist-1 since 2015. This star is located at a distance of 39 light years from our solar system in the Aquarius constillation. Initially only three planets of this system were known. But yesterday (22 Feb 2017) NASA announced that four more planets are in motion around the star. These planets are called Trappist-1 b,c,d and the next four batches are named as e,f,g,h according to their orbits. Based on their densities, all of the TRAPPIST-1 planets are likely to be rocky. Further observations will not only help determine whether they are rich in water, but also possibly reveal whether any could have liquid water on their surfaces. The mass of the seventh and farthest exoplanet has not yet been estimated - scientists believe it could be an icy, \"snowball-like\" world, but further observations are needed. In contrast to our sun, the TRAPPIST-1 star - classified as an ultra-cool dwarf - is so cool that liquid water could survive on planets orbiting very close to it, closer than is possible on planets in our solar system. All seven of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary orbits are closer to their host star than Mercury is to our sun. The planets also are very close to each other. If a person was standing on one of the planet's surface, they could gaze up and potentially see geological features or clouds of neighboring worlds, which would sometimes appear larger than the moon in Earth's sky. - NASA There is no specific criteria for determining if it habitable or not. But we do hear about colonisation of Mars. So if humans are capable of doing that, then living in one of these planets would be much easier. The only problem is the distance. It is 39\u201340 light years away i.e. if we travel at the speed of light ( not possible as of now) for 40 years, we'll reach there. This sounds illogical. But you never know if alien civilizations have already formed there !! This is a 360\u00b0 view of the Trappist-1 d   Hope this answers your question. ",
