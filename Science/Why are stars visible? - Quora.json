            "answer_text": "Every object that emits or reflects light is visible to our eyes. And in case of stars they emit their own light which travels astronomical distances to reach us and thus are visible to us. In addition to this let me tell you an amazing fact about stars. When we look at the stars we are actually looking into the past. This is because the light that is reaching earth right now was emitted by that particular star years ago. For example take the closest star Alpha Century A which is 4 light years away from earth, i. e. , it takes 4 years for light to travel from ALPHA CENTURY to EARTH. That means if you are looking at Alpha Century star right now then you are able to see it because of the light it emitted 4 years ago. If the star dies right now, you will still see it for the next 4 years. Hence, the night sky that you see is just a refection of the past.  ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: in Southern Hemisphere in mid July - mid August Also, from there you can clearly see the Magellanic Clouds, the galaxies satellites of our Milky Way and our Galaxy center. But if you live in Northern hemisphere, also July -August (then Milky Way is overhead) is a good time, but is REQUIRED a moonless night and clear sky away (15 miles at last from any city light). A desert will do.My magical experience was when I was climbing Kilimanjaro. From there, high altitude and dark sky, almost you can see your shadow from the light of the stars! No joke! And regardless the hemisphere, binoculars will help a lot. Just lay on your back and wander along the Milky Way with the binoculars. You will be totally amazed! Literally you will see the stars like you see the grains of the sand on a beach. Also, star clouds and small nebulas. And try to accommodate your eye to see the faintest stars, not the obvoius front ones but those faint behind. It\u2019s a great experience. But I repeat, you need a clear sky and very dark location. Please use this map of light pollution, to find your nearby dark location here: Light pollution map Remember, a city nearby make the total difference from a dull gray or reddish sky with a max 6 to 10 stars, to this wonder:  ",
