            "answer_text": "If it didn\u2019t there would be no redox reaction! Are you asking why do redox reactions happen? The oxidant can accept electrons in such a way that the electrons end up in a lower energy level than they were in the reductant. This is a matter of degree. The more tightly electrons are held[they are in lower energy orbitals] the more difficult the substance is to oxidize and the stronger an oxidizing agent must be to react with them. So oxidants have high positive oxidation number because they have reacted with elements such as oxygen that have removed electrons from a central atom. Examples are permanganate, MnO4-; Nitrate, NO3-; chlorate, ClO3-. Ions of higher charge for the same element, Fe+3 is a stronger oxidant than Fe+2. Finally elements with higher electron affinities are better oxidants The strongest being O, F, and Cl followed by Br and S ",

            "answer_text": "Because the oxidizing agent accepts an electron from the reducing agent. The oxidizing agent gets reduced, and the reducing agent gets oxidized. Such reactions are named RedOx reactions. There are a great many of them. This is the nomenclature that describes electron transfer reactions. The mechanisms of such electron transfers is described in great detail in chemistry books. ",
