            "answer_text": "No. The stars are what we call \"cosmic kitchen\" which cooks various elements and to specify them we classify them into various generation of stars  I. First Generation.  The first generation of stars as the name suggests are the first stars that were formed after big bag. During that phase, only hydrogen and helium were prominent in the universe so the first generation stars had only hydrogen and helium. Now as I said stars are cosmic kitchens,  via nuclear fusion, H is now He (Helium) ! Now comes the exciting part ! Supernova! BANG ! goes the star and all the elements cooked inside them are now spread out in the galactic area. II. Second Generation.   you see, the star is like a phoenix it rises from its ashes again. When the matter which was spewed out by GEN 1 stars, new stars are born with these materials. Now the NEW or 2nd gen stars have  H and He, eventually they run out of fuel, become a red giant and in that process H and He form Carbon and Oxygen.  Our sun is a second generation star.  III.Third Generation.After sweeping up C and O the stars have - Hydrogen- Helium - Carbon - Oxygen etc  remember cosmic kitchen ? yup, through fusion, given \"appropriate\" conditions even heavier elements like Silicon are forged in stars and later on in a supernova that Si is turned into Iron.  So all in all, Yes stars do contain H and He but no H and He aren't the only elements inside a star. ",

            "answer_text": "Each and every star contain hydrogen and helium only when they are in their infant stage.The amount of hydrogen a star start with determine its size. During whole of its lifetime a star experience two forces. Gravitational pull which is trying to pull it inwards and a force genrated by fusion of elements in its core which is trying to pull it outwards.  Intresting things happen when a star exhaust its hydrogen. The force due to fusion gets weaker and gravitational pull dominate over it. Thus shrinking the star in its size. In the last stages of its life a star do fusion reaction as much as it can to fight the force of gravity. It makes carbon,nitrogen and then iron. After iron fusion reaction stops and this results in the death of the star. A star as big as our sun can't make elements after iron. (Fun fact: 1 kg iron is sufficient to kill our poor sun if you are able to put it inside its core)However some stars bigger than our sun make rest of the elements of our periodic table in just last few seconds of their life. And after that they result in supernovae. Spreading all the elements in the universe. So ya the gold and diamond ring that you wear was once made in core of a star which was 1000 times bigger than our sun and who died fighting his own gravitational pull.",

            "answer_text": "No, they are not.In fact, every single element that you see in the world around you was formed in the core of a star! That's right, the carbon in your body, the iron in your haemoglobin, the silicon in your computer or mobile devide, they were all formed in the cores of stars. Once the hydrogen in the core of a star is nearly exhausted, almost all  naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime and, for some stars, by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Other than the popular Hydrogen to Helium fusion, a number of reactions take place in stars. Examples of element making (nucleogenesis) reactions:  3 helium atoms fusing to give a carbon atom: 3 @ 4He \u2192 12C  carbon atom + helium atom fusing to give an oxygen atom: 12C + 4He \u2192 16O  oxygen atom + helium atom fusing to give a neon atom: 16O + 4He \u2192 20Ne  neon atom + helium atom fusing to give a magnesium atom: 20Ne + 4He \u2192 24Mg Source: http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Just-Elemental/Science-Ideas-and-Concepts/How-elements-are-formed These reactions take place because the core is always under huge pressure and under high temperatures. The temperature in the core region of a star is several million kelvins. Like the above reactions, the elements keep fusing under these extreme conditions to form the 90 natural elements. This periodic table shows where and how these elements were formed.  ",

            "answer_text": "Sudarson Nantha covers most of the points; but I want to add one more. There are no stars which are made of solely H and He. However, the abundance of heavier elements varies greatly. Especially, older stars have much less abundance of heavier elements (called metallicity) than younger ones. This is because when the older stars formed, there was less time for heavier elements to have formed by nucleosynthesis. As the universe ages, the amount of heavier elements in the interstellar medium increases; causing the newer stars to have more metallicity. Existence of stars with almost no metallicity (i.e., they are the earliest stars - also known as Population-III stars) has been hypothesized; but none have been found so far. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Hydrogen and helium are the primary fuels. As they burn up, various possibilities are there for a star's life. In one particular case (by far the best concerned with this question), the atoms fuse to form heavier atoms like carbon, releasing energy. This will continue as long as fusion releases energy. And how long is that? For that, you need to study the thermodynamics, or rather, energetics, of nuclear processes. Look up the binding energy per nucleon versus atomic number curve. You will see that it peaks at Iron: Iron has more binding energy per nucleon than any other element. So, if fusion occurs after iron, it will absorb energy, rather than release energy. So, elements may fuse up to iron, but fusion of iron to form heavier elements cannot occur inside the star's core to fuel it. When the star explodes in a supernova, a huge amount of energy is released at once. Then, a part of this amount of energy may be absorbed by iron to form more energetic and less stable (nuclear point of view) heavier elements. This is the history of formation of all naturally found elements, in our universe. ",
