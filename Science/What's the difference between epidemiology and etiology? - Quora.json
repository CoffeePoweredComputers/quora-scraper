            "answer_text": "Roughly:  Epidemiology answers the questions - who's sick? How does it behave and spread? Who's likely to be sick next week/month/year? Understanding the epidemiology of a condition is a major component of public health.  Aetiology answers the question: what causes the condition?  Note that you don't HAVE to know the aetiology of a disease to study its epidemiology, though it may help you avoid dead ends. Example - the emergence of a cluster of rare malignancies and unusual infections in a small group of gay men in San Francisco lead to the discovery of the condition now called AIDS. At that stage, that aetiology was unknown but the pattern of disease incidence and prevalence helped target the search for a cause. We don't know what causes multiple sclerosis but we have a lot of data about geographical and seasonal variation.  ",

            "answer_text": "\"Etiology\", also written \"aetiology\" or \"\u00e6tiology\" is the study of the cause or origin of the illness. So the etiologic agent for the disease called bubonic plague is the plague bacillus (Yersina pestis). However the etiology of the that disease includes the other contributing factors such as being bitten by a flea that had been infected with the bacillus through feeding on an infected rodent.\"Epidemiology\" is the field where all factors that contribute to health and ill-health among a population are studied.  Of course when considering a specific illness, the main focus of epidemiology is finding the etiology of that illness. But epidemiology takes a much wider view of the population, studied over time, and includes relationships between illness and wellness and social and behavioral factors, genetics, economics, treatments, and compliance.

            "answer_text": "For Epidemiology I like the definition from Principles of Epidemiology, 3rd Edition. \u201cBy definition, epidemiology is the study (scientific, systematic, and data-driven) of the distribution (frequency, pattern) and determinants (causes, risk factors) of health-related states and events (not just diseases) in specified populations (neighborhood, school, city, state, country, global). It is also the application of this study to the control of health problems\u201d. Etiologic studies the cause or origin of diseases. A disease's etiology, or cause, generally falls into three main categories; intrinsic (comes from within), extrinsic (comes from external factors) and idiopathic (unknown cause). Epidemiology focuses on health (not just diseases) and population levels, while Etiology\u2019s focus is only on diseases and it\u2019s on the individual level. ",

            "answer_text": "Timothy Sly's answer is perfect, but if you want a condensed version: Etiology is the (usually unknown) set of causes of the disease.  It's important to keep in mind that etiology is not only disease-specific, it's also person-specific, in that a set of factors can cause Disease X in one person but not another (given their genetics, how they grew up, their fitness level, their co-exposures, etc.). Epidemiology is the study of both the distribution of disease (who has it, where, and when), as well as its causes (etiology).  Some epidemiologists exclusively study disease distributions while others exclusively try to pin down causal associations with the disease, but generally the training includes both types of work. ",
