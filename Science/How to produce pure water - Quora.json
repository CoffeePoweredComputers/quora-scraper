            "answer_text": "You are spoiled for choice: Controlled burning of pure hydrogen in pure oxygen followed by condensation of the water vapour produced.Passage of virtually any water source through activated carbon (to remove organic and other non-ionic chemicals from solution), followed by ion-exchange resins to remove ions.Treating the water to reverse osmosis as done in the Middle East where fresh water is scarce.Distillation.Rainfall collection in a non-polluted region (not, for example, in many industrialised parts of China!).Obviously, the purer the starting condition of the water or its gaseous components, the less work will be required to purify it further. You do not specify its end use and, therefore, it is pointless advising on which is the most appropriate option. For example, it would be unwise to rely on your total bodily water intake in its pure form. The natural electrolytes in water are generally beneficial to maintaing health, excluding obvious toxic ions and compounds generally a product of pollution by man. And finally, if the water hasn\u2019t been heat-treated it\u2019s always advisable to heat the water to bp in order to kill off all microorganisms. Prions would require higher temperatures to inactivate them. ",

            "answer_text": "Deionise tap water. Distill it under vacuum with a \u201ccold trap\u201d, which is a condenser that can freeze out the water vapour by being at a very low temperature. Contaminants such as carbon dioxide and residual oxygen, nitrogen and argon from air will be drawn off by the vacuum and will not condense in the trap. If you can heat this cold trap, and have a second stage cold trap, you can repeat the operation to pull away a few more residual atoms of contaminants. Maybe a third stage if you are really fussy. Don't forget that you do not have protium oxide only: there will be some deuterium oxide (heavy water) and (I think) some tritium oxide. Also, to prevent contamination of your reasonably pure water, you should shield your equipment with lead shielding, to protect against radioactive decay products entering your product through the glass. Of course, as soon as you open your trap to the atmosphere, your pure water is \u2018toast\u2019. ",
