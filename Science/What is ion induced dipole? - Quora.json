            "answer_text": "This type of attractive forces operate between the polar molecules having permanent dipole and the molecules lacking permanent dipole. Permanent dipole of the polar molecule induces dipole on the electrically neutral molecule by deforming it's electron cloud.Thus an induced dipole is developed in the other molecule. ",
