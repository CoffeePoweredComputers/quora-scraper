            "answer_text": "Black is not a colour as it has no \u2018chromaticity\u2019. Your visual system represents color pretty much like an old-style color television. It has a \u2018luminance\u2019 channel that is backwards compatible with older black & white televisions, and then it has 2 color channels added on to that. You can see that directly by the video inputs \u2014 which consist of one luminance cable and two \u2018chrominance\u2019 cables. If you unplug the two color inputs and leave just the luminance input (Y) then you will get a black & white image.  What can be confusing is the fact that there are two types of white. The first \u2018white\u2019 is what you see on your black & white television. It represents how bright something is. The second white is part of the color space, and it represents how saturated a color is. A fully saturated color has no \u2018white\u2019 mixed in with it and is represented at the outer edge of the chromaticity diagram. As you add more white a color becomes less and less saturated and the color is represented closer to the center of the chromaticity diagram. Right in the center is 100% pure white (which still has a hue associated with it, but you just can\u2019t see it). This is what you see when you look at a white flower. Put that white flower next to a black & white television and you will see that the white of the flower is different from the white of the television. Neither the black nor the white of that television are colors. Black is also not the \u2018absence of light\u2019. You can see pure black but yet there is plenty of light hitting your visual sensors. To see this just have a look at the glossy screen on phone or on your tablet (Samsung OLED tablets are particularly reflective). When it is off its almost like a mirror and you can easily see your reflection. This means there is plenty of light hitting your sensors. But when its on and it is displaying an object that is pure black then you will see exactly that. It follows, therefore, that \u2018black\u2019 is something your visual system calculates from sensor input rather than it simply being the lack of sensor input. Another curious fact is that psilocybin will reduce the threshold for seeing black and demonstrates that when you normally \u2018see\u2019 black that your visual system is actually being conservative when it decides that something is \u2018black\u2019. If you turn the dial up to maximum luminance you can literally see in the dark \u2014 that is, what normally appears as pitch black looks like it is glowing with its own light. Of course there has to be some light that is recorded by your visual sensors, but this clearly demonstrates that \u2018black\u2019 is a product of your visual system not of your sensors. You might have noticed something similar with your digital camera, when it shows you something on the screen preview that looks perfectly fine but when you actually take the picture all you get is black. Which can be quite annoying when you are trying to take pictures in low-light conditions. This is the chromaticity space for the CIE standard observer:  This is the ideal form of this chromaticity space, which might make more sense:  A color space can be a bit difficult to understand. Basically it represents the information that is coming from the two colour channels of your old-style television. Colours are represented by the outer circle and the center point is white. All colours within that circle are a proportionate mixture of white and a specific color (hue). This can be more easily understood from looking at how colours look on the spectrum. White is simply light at equal strength all across the visual spectrum. The \u2018colour\u2019 is a narrow spectral component. When the white component is low we see the colour as pure (highly saturated) and if the white component is high we see the colour as mostly white-ish. If the white component is at exactly the same level as the colour component then we see 100% pure white, which is right at the center of the chromaticity space.  What this systematic illustration of colour shows you is that what the visual system is coding when you see colour is the wavelength of the colour component and the degree to which there is white in that colour. It does not matter how strong the light is, it is the ratio of the narrow spectral component to the broad spectral component that matters. As can be seen from the \u2018square\u2019 chromaticity space above, the visual system codes \u2018wavelength\u2019 in a peculiar way. It is not coded directly as a number in the way a spectrometer might do it. It is coded as the distance from known reference points on the spectrum. These reference points are perceived as the \u2018primary\u2019 colours and they are shown by the 4 vertices in the chromaticity diagram above. This particular chromaticity space is produced by 3 specially selected visual sensors, which by coincidence have a response function that is quite similar to that of the the human visual sensors. The circular colour space is that of a visual system with 4 visual sensors \u2014 which also has 4 primaries, but its not clear where they are as the chromaticity space is entirely circular. The two chromaticity spaces are equivalent though because there is a simply mathematical transform from one to the other. ",

            "answer_text": "It all depends on your perspective. You could define black as the absence of colour, and you could say that anything that reflects or emits light to some extent has a colour. White light contains all colours, and if you filter it you can extract any colour you want from white light depending on the filter you use. Switch off all the light sources and you are left with black - no light. People talk about black light, but it just means light that you can\u2019t detect with your eyes. Certain animals can see light that human beings can\u2019t. Colour is in the eye of the beholder. What we call the visible spectrum - light wavelengths from violet to red, is the light that typical humans can see. But many animals, such as birds, bees and some fish, can perceive ultraviolet. Some snakes can see infrared. For those animals, what we see as black might appear coloured to them. From an emission viewpoint, pure black emits nothing (in the visible spectrum). The most extreme example is a black hole. From an absorption or transmission viewpoint, black absorbs everything. We say that some spectacle lenses are colourless. That\u2019s true from a light transmission perspective. It\u2019s interesting that black people are sometimes called coloured. If they are jet black, they have no colour. Actually everybody else should be called coloured. Don\u2019t overthink that. I am no racist. ",
