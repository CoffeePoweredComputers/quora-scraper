            "answer_text": "There is land around the perimeter of Antarctica that our nuclear bomb submarines can\u2019t penetrate, and there are rocky mountains. A dead giveaway that there is a likely continent in the middle. Then as technologies have improved like ground penetrating radar and observations from space, as well as geological and seismological investigations, they all began to paint a picture of the continent below, starting in the 1950,s I\u2019d imagine.

            "answer_text": "You can see a whole lot of land features such as mountains poking through the ice:   Images: Wikipedia Or in the rare ice-free areas:  McMurdo Dry Valleys - image: Atlas Obscura Also, if it was purely water, you wouldn\u2019t have ice-caps - you\u2019d have pack-ice and floes like the Arctic Ocean. These are rarely more than a few meters thick, and will be broken up by winds and waves before they can get overly tall. So, even before we had deep radar, seismic mapping, and other high-tech ways to map out the topography of the land under the ice, it was pretty widely accepted that the ice was on land, not on water.

Later, when explorers moved inland, they spotted more mountain peaks sticking above the ice. Finally, after WWII, radar technology made it possible to look beneath the ice and see the contours of the entire continent. ",
