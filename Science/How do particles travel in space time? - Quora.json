            "answer_text": "See the wave you are talking about regarding particles is not what you know about waves.  See for photons it's a different ball game. Photons are in another way electromagnetic waves and are actual physical waves in true sense. But waves of matter particles are not waves at all. They are PROBABLITY WAVES.  By probability wave it means the probability of finding the particle within the wave packet  which is dependent directly on the square of the wave amplitude.  So if you are told about proton waves then they are not physical waves but guassian wave packets of probabilities.  It's that that simple ",
