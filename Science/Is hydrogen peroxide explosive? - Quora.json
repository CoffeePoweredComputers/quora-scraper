            "answer_text": "I say no. It is an oxidizer. I do not consider it explosive\u2026 just dangerous. I suppose seeing what happens when hydrogen peroxide decomposes would give you some idea of how dangerous it is. There is a lot of chemical energy released when it decomposes; but, not really explosive. Hydrogen peroxide is an unstable chemical and will break. It will decompose over time to water and oxygen. It oxidizes things by releasing an oxygen atom as a free radical (really toothy mean form of oxygen). If you want to break hydrogen peroxide, just sneeze. There is a plant called a touch-me-not that grows in ditches in wet areas, if you touch the banana-shaped seed pod\u2026 it explodes and throws seeds everywhere. Hydrogen peroxide is like that, unstable! We use liver dust to break H2O2 to propel chemical cars in engineering competition. It is very exothermic and gets very hot. You can use yeast or potassium iodide solution to break H2O2. There is very famous demonstration for chemistry students called \u201celephants toothpaste\u201d which demonstrates disassociation reactions to college students.  Hydrogen peroxide burns things when it decomposes\u2026 such as hair. It breaks double carbon bonds and oxidizes them causing them to reflect instead of absorb light, sodium hypoclorite will also oxidize bonds and will lighten the color of hair (bleach blonde).  Nitrogen triiodide is the best demonstration of a decomposition reaction. It is like peroxide; but, it is a nitrogen based compound which is unstable\u2026 very unstable. The peroxide sold in drug stores is only a few percent H2O2, the strong solutions used in our labs and for bleaching hair is very concentrated and should be handled carefully. Do not try this type of decomposition reaction demonstration without very careful training. These are fun and educational; but, very dangerous because the hydrogen peroxide, if concentrated solution is used, will burn you. When it touches your skin or eyes, the free radical oxygen will destroy your tissue just like you touched it with a hot poker. Your skin will turn black and peel off. ",

            "answer_text": "Note: I am referring to pure hydrogen peroxide, not the stuff they sell in the drugstore that is 96% water. If you handle hydrogen peroxide, you do have a certain risk that sooner or later an explosion will occur. The peroxide does not just spontaneously explode: the explosion happens when catalysts cause a sudden decomposition producing singlet oxygen which rapidly combines chemically with anything handy. The Royal Navy ship (submarine) HMS Sidon sank when a torpedo that used hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizer inadvertently exploded. The Royal Navy immediately ceased use of hydrogen peroxide for torpedoes.  The Russian submarine Kursk carried torpedoes that used hydrogen peroxide. One of them exploded while the ship was submerged. The resulting damage led to the explosion of several other torpedoes, sinking the Kursk and dooming its crew.  Many who read my answers will know that the early chemical lasers, HF and DF, carried hydrogen, deuterium and some form of fluorine such as 2,3,6 trifluoronitrile. We had accidents when the fluorine contacted bare metal, and spectacular things happened, throwing large pieces of equipment hundreds of feet into the air. (We ran like hell.) Later chemical lasers mixed potassium hydroxide with hydrogen peroxide, which we called \u201cBHP\u201d (basic hydrogen peroxide) for short, but no one was fooled. The slightest contamination would at the very least cause the BHP to rapidly foam like a giant diet-Pepsi bottle with Mentos added. It is not just a sticky mess: it is a real hazmat clean up.  Followers will also know that the US DoD decided to stop work on chemical lasers after the airborne laser was mothballed and after several minor accidents on the Advanced Tactical Laser that we flew on a C-130.  Video showing how to force an explosive decomposition of H2O2. There have been several even more spectacular accidents in transporting hydrogen peroxide. A road accident with a tanker truck full of hydrogen peroxide is just asking for an explosion that even Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman would dread. ",

            "answer_text": "If stored under proper conditions of temperature, in a smooth non-reactive container, hydrogen peroxide is fairly stable. But it can decompose in the presence of various catalysts and contaminants, or at high temperatures, to oxygen and water. This decomposition is an exothermic reaction and the decomposition reaction can in fact run away catastrophically under the wrong conditions, since the rate of decomposition increases with increasing temperature. This can cause a large buildup of pressure in the container, which may cause it to burst if there is no pressure relief valve. Oxygen can easily support combustion and if anything is present that can burn, such a process can potentially lead to a vapour phase explosion due to gas pressure and any combustible materials around, and a serious fire can result, especially with hydrogen peroxide at high concentration. So at high concentration, 60% or over, hydrogen peroxide certainly must be stored very carefully, and under proper conditions of temperature, with no contaminants at all in the containers that are used. The hydrogen peroxide that you get from pharmacies for use as a disinfectant is only 3% typically, and poses little danger. The plastic containers it is sold in are not airtight, and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is low. But with 30% concentration and over I would start to take some care in storing it. It is a strong oxidizing agent but it is not itself usually considered an explosive. Nevertheless even small amounts of contamination can lead to a runaway decomposition reaction, and if this happens the effects may be nearly indistinguishable from an explosion. So real care is needed when storing or transporting large amounts. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.859.2410&rep=rep1&type=pdf Hydrogen peroxide is becoming popular in the chemical industry owing to its environment friendly advantage. In general, the normal rate of decomposition for commercially supplied hydrogen peroxide is extremely low, well under 1% loss per year [1]. However, it is well known that dramatically breakdown can be triggered by even micro amount of reactive impurities, or by contacting with incompatible rough surfaces. Therefore, hydrogen peroxide should be stored in a container composed of non-reactive materials. However, contamination accidents frequently occur due to mishandling or other reasons. On 15 September, 2010, at 12:30, a powerful explosion occurred on the 307 National Highway in Jinzhou, Hebei. The explosion was caused by a truck loaded with 5 tons hydrogen peroxide. Shock waves from the blast shattered almost windows of the building within a 150m radius. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. However, 19 people had injuries from the H2O2 or scattered fragments. Table 1 shows the major accidents in the past 30 years that caused by H2O2 owing to its thermal instability or incompatibility. The major safety problems of hydrogen peroxide are the potential for rapid pressurization from catalyzed decomposition, fire due to oxygen formed in decomposition and vapor phase explosions. There are several works concerning runaway reaction hazards of hydrogen peroxide both with and without contamination. Eto [2] studied effects of various ions on the runaway reaction of hydrogen peroxide by using a glass vessel. Wu [3] analyzed the thermal hazard and incompatible reaction of hydrogen peroxide by DSC (differential scanning calorimetry). Lu and Yang [4] estimated the criteria of critical runaway at various volumetric ratios of the hydrogen peroxide to hydrochloric acid. Liu [5] investigated the effect of micro amount of Fe3+ on thermal explosion of hydrogen peroxide using ARC (accelerating rate calorimeter). Zhang [6] studied thermal explosion mechanism of hydrogen peroxide and its prevention measures. Raines [7] estimated the contaminated hydrogen peroxide for storage and transport by using the FTAI (fast thermal activity interpreter). ",

            "answer_text": "Is H[math]_2[/math]O[math]_2[/math] explosive? Short answer: Yes, but not on its own \u2014 it is a highly reactive oxidizer, so it depends on with what it is mixed. Cut from Wikipedia article Hydrogen peroxide (bold added): Hydrogen peroxide, either in pure or diluted form, can pose several risks, the main one being that it forms explosive mixtures upon contact with organic compounds. Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide itself is unstable and can cause a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE) of the remaining liquid. Distillation of hydrogen peroxide at normal pressures is thus highly dangerous. The same wiki also lists a few known incidents of exploding H[math]_2[/math]O[math]_2[/math]: On 16 July 1934, in Kummersdorf, Germany, a propellant tank containing an experimental monopropellant mixture consisting of hydrogen peroxide and ethanol exploded during a test, killing three people.In April 1992, an explosion occurred at the hydrogen peroxide plant at Jarrie in France, due to technical failure of the computerised control system and resulting in one fatality and wide destruction of the plant.The Russian submarine K-141 Kursk sailed to perform an exercise of firing dummy torpedoes at the Pyotr Velikiy, a Kirov-class battlecruiser. On 12 August 2000, at 11:28 local time (07:28 UTC), there was an explosion while preparing to fire the torpedoes. The only credible report to date is that this was due to the failure and explosion of one of the Kursk's hydrogen peroxide-fueled torpedoes.When it comes to making use of the explosive/expansion forces bound into H[math]_2[/math]O[math]_2[/math], evolution beat human chemists to the punch by many millions of years! Cut from Wikipedia article Bombardier beetle (bold added): Bombardier beetles are ground beetles (Carabidae) [\u2026] which are most notable for the defense mechanism that gives them their name: when disturbed, they eject a hot noxious chemical spray from the tip of the abdomen with a popping sound. The spray is produced from a reaction between two chemical compounds, hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide, which are stored in two reservoirs in the beetle's abdomen. When the aqueous solution of hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide reaches the vestibule, catalysts facilitate the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide and the oxidation of the hydroquinone. Heat from the reaction brings the mixture to near the boiling point of water and produces gas that drives the ejection. Cut from weebly.com article Bombardier Beetles \u2014 Physiology:  The reaction chamber is much smaller than the reservoir and contains two kinds of enzymes \u2014 catalases and peroxidases. Catalases promote the release of oxygen from hydrogen peroxide. This freed oxygen is then used by the peroxidases which catalyse the oxidation of the hydroquinones into quinones. The pressure from the liberated oxygen in the small chamber simultaneously causes the ejection of the quinones. Thermodynamic calculations predicted that these reactions would release enough heat to bring the aqueous solution to boiling point. This was confirmed by measuring the temperature of the secretions with an electric thermometer (Anashansley et al. 1969; Eisner, Eisner & Siegler 2005). Handling with care advised!

            "answer_text": "Not really. Hydrogen peroxide releases oxygen when decomposing to water. This can cause two \u201cexplosive\u201d problems. First, oxygen causes combustibles to burn really fast. That can ignite fuel in a way that causes really rapid burning. Close it in a container and that reaction can cause an explosion. The second way is simply by building up pressure in a container to the point it ruptures. In these cases hydrogen peroxide isn't the explosive but contributes to a potential explosion under certain circumstances. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes it is, it is an unstable molecule, danger depends on the concentration, the temperature and what substance is reacting with it. The drug store bottle at 4% is ok, no danger there but higher concentrations may be offered elsewhere and may become explosive. Never attempt to distill it, at concentration higher than 30%, it starts to be really dangerous. A student of my university waas distilling peroxides under a protective hood but there was an explosion and this guy lost a hand setting fire to the department. We are talking about a chemistry lab in a major University. So do not try to repeat, strong oxydants can get out of hands depending on a simple reactive impurity. ",

            "answer_text": "As a pure substance, hydrogen peroxide tends to explode, by decomposing into water and (di)oxygen. When it is in the form of an aqueous solution, the risk of explosion increases with increasing the concentration of H2O2 in the solution. Usually, concentrations higher than 40% (as weight) are considered to be dangerous and caution is required in handling and storage. The risk of explosion greatly increases if hydrogen peroxide comes into contact with easily oxidizable substances, such as fuels. In these cases, hydrogen peroxide reduces to water. ",

            "answer_text": "Hydrogen peroxide decomposes into oxygen and water. The decomposition is very exothermic - it gets hot - so much so that at concentrations of 68% or so the water arrives in the form of steam. At higher concentrations, the steam is just produced at a higher temperature, and the decomposition is more rapid. Highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide is extremely dangerous and has caused a number of industrial accidents, including sinking the Russian submarine Kursk. Now one definition of an explosive is a substance that releases a large volume of gas very rapidly when it decomposes, and that\u2019s exactly what concentrated hydrogen peroxide does. So is H2O2 explosive? Well, not really, but it\u2019s a distinction without a difference. ",
