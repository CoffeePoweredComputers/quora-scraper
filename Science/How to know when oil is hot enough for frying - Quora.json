            "answer_text": "I normally use a thermometer. You can use a candy thermometer if desired as it handles high temperatures quite well. In the absence of a thermometer, if you have battered something, drop in a couple of drops of the batter. If it sizzles and bubbles, it is ready. Likewise with breading. Take a small scrap of the breading and drop in. See how it reacts. The chopstick idea is nice, but you have to have bamboo chopsticks. The absolute best is a thermometer. I found this on online for the bargain price of $2.63 USD. It works from 100\u00b0 F to 400\u00b0 F. Well worth it to take the guesswork out of your cooking and it will clip on to the side of the pan.  ",
