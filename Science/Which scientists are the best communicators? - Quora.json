            "answer_text": "The best scientific communicator is the person who translates the world of fancy jargons to the minds of non scientific background. However there are few scientist who bridges the gap effectively. Prof. Brian Cox is my personal favourite role model, Some of the best scientific communicators are Michio Kaku, Stephen W. Hawking, Brian Greene, Neil Tyson, Michelle Thaler, Hakeem M. Oluseyi, Phil Plait, Lisa Randall, Sean Carroll, Alex Filippenko and many others. Carl Sagan and Richard P. Feynman are the king of science personality. ",
