            "answer_text": "Yes. Age related hearing loss is also known as presbycusis. There are 4 types of presbycusis. Sensory, neural, strial and cochlear conductive/mechanical. The first type is sensory presbycusis. This happens when you lose outer hair cells within the inner ear. Higher frequencies will be lost first followed by lower frequencies. This disease spreads from the base to the apex of the cochlea. The base contains hair cells that detect higher frequencies while the apex contains hair cells that detects lower frequencies. This is also the most commons form of presbycusis Neural presbycusis is the degeneration of nerves that connects the cochlea to the brain and is the second most commons. This form of presbycusis is the most severe as speech discrimination is the worst among all 4 types. It is also more difficult to detect through hearing tests like pure tone audiometry because pure tones don't get affected until 90% of neurons are lost. With each decade you lose 2100 neurons. In total we have about 16000 neurons. Strial presbycusis occurs due to the atrophy of the stria vascularis that provides nutrients and oxygen to the inner ear. This affects the loss of all frequencies equally. Lastly, cochlear conductive presbycusis. Here, thickening of the basilar membrane occurs. This normally affects low frequencies because it is most severe at the narrow turns of the basal region of the cochlea. ",
