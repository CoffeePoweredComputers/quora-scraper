            "answer_text": "How would the uncertainty principle be explained in layman's terms? This answer will be a little long and detailed, but I promise it\u2019s in layman\u2019s terms, in the sense, you don\u2019t need a lot of prerequisites to make sense of this answer. We will first explore what the uncertainty principle really is,  Then explore some facts about quantum nature,  Then understand both of the above using some wave theory. [visuals, no math] So let\u2019s begin. The uncertainty principle [HUP] is not a fundamental property of nature at all. In fact, it's a consequence of something deeper. It's also got nothing to do with measuring or quantum. It's got something to do with waves, any waves for that matter. So first, what is the uncertainty principle. In simple terms, if you try to figure out exactly where a particle is, you will see that the particle has undefined speed/direction. [Notice I am saying it has, not that it cannot be measured, this is super important]. Similarly, if you try to figure out exactly the speed/direction of a particle's motion, you will find that it exists in multiple locations at the same time. Now the above statements might sound weird. Because it's hinting that somehow particles can be at multiple locations at the same time, or have multiple speeds at the same time isn't it? Guess what, as weird as this sounds it's absolutely true. Unlike what our day to day objects (big things) behave, quantum particles don't have a defined location or speed/direction. You might ask, why this is true? But then I can ask why not? That's fundamentally how things behave. Then you may ask a better question, why most big things don't behave this way? Then that's a good question. The answer is, they still do behave this way. It's just that the range of locations and speeds that these tiny particles posses are way, way smaller than the size of our big things. Imagine an ant teleporting and dancing all over the earth, the ants' location is totally undefined isn't it, but if you zoom out and see from the sun's point of view, the whole earth looks like a dot, and we could say that this ant is having a definite location. But remember the quantum particles are not really teleporting or dancing, that was just an example to explain why we miss these undefined location/speed thingy for big things. In summary, when you look at the quantum world, there are two levels of weirdness. Level 1 - Accepting that quantum particles have undefined location or speed at any given moment. Level 2 - When you try to narrow down one, the other ends up becoming super undefined [HUP]. Now let's convince ourselves that HUP has really nothing to do with the quantum world. It's got something to do with waves. Consider the simplest wave ever. A sine wave.  Imagine that this is a wave on a surface of water. It has a single frequency of say 10 Hz. This means, that any point, if you wait for 1 second, 10 waves will pass by you. You can also see that this wave has no beginning and no ending, it\u2019s infinitely big. Now get this, this wave has 1 and only 1 single frequency [and just one particular speed say 10 km/hr to the right], but it\u2019s location is everywhere. This wave is everywhere isn\u2019t it? So we have a system, whose speed we know precisely but it\u2019s location is everywhere in the universe. Now let\u2019s say we want to confine it\u2019s location, how would we do that? Say we wanted that wave NOT to exist at certain locations, what can we do? Well we can use the concept of \u2018destructive interference\u2019. Let\u2019s take an example. Suppose we generate another such wave, but this time it has a slightly higher frequency say 11 Hz and moving to the right at say 11 km/hr. It would look like this  The lower one is of 11 Hz. You can see this lower is a little tightly packed compared to the one above. Now notice that there are places where the two waves line up exactly peaks on peak valleys on valleys [like at the beginning of the wave], and at certain places they line up opposite peaks on valleys [like when you go to the 5th peak of the first wave]. So imagine these waves were to be mixed together, what would happen? Well, where the waves line up, they would create bigger wave, and where they line up \u2018opposite\u2019 they would destroy each other. So together it would look like this  The combination of the two waves is shown by the third one, the bottom most one. Now let\u2019s just concentrate on this wave  Can you see, that at certain locations the wave doesn\u2019t exist anymore. So in sense we have \u2018decreased it\u2019s uncertainty in location\u2019, but now what\u2019s the speed of this wave now? Is it 10 km/hr? is 11 km/hr? It has both isn\u2019t it [because it\u2019s made of these two travelling waves]. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s 10 or 11, we know it\u2019s BOTH!. So to summarise, when we narrowed down on it\u2019s location (just a little bit) it\u2019s speed became a little uncertain (10 and 11) This is the uncertainty principle. Now let\u2019s get rid of all the misconceptions. Notice this has nothing to do with measuring things. It has nothing to do with information. It\u2019s just the way how waves work. Just for the sake of completeness, we can keep going further, let\u2019s keep adding more and more waves and see how the system evolves. After adding three waves,  Now, the location is more precise but speed is more uncertain (three speeds)  With 5 waves, you can already see, the location is getting more and more precise, and as a result it\u2019s speed is more and more uncertain. I am too lazy to keep doing this, but you can see what would happen if we were to keep continuing. We would eventually get a very sharp narrow peak meaning the location is very precise but speed is very imprecise. The quantum particles are pretty much like these waves. [I say pretty much because they are super weird to imagine, but mathematically almost identical to these water waves]. So when we are detecting an electron, say, we are making it\u2019s location super precise. When that happens, we can imagine the electron as a super position of almost infinite waves each one have it\u2019s own speed. As a result, it\u2019s speed gets extremely uncertain, satisfying the HUP. When we try to figure out it\u2019s speed, what we really do is we select one of these interfering waves, and get rid of all the others, when that happens, the electron has just one single speed, but now it\u2019s position ends getting super spread out [because we have stripped away all the waves that would cause destruction at many locations] Hopefully, this answers the question. If you found it satisfactory feel free to leave a like. I am happy to answer any questions you may have :) ",

            "answer_text": "Perhaps the first thing to realize is that the uncertainty principle is not about limitation on the accuracy of our measurements. It is poorly named in this regard. The most common expression of the uncertainty principle is something like this. The more precisely you know an object\u2019s position the less you can know about where it is going. That sure sounds like a limitation of our measurement ability but it is something more fundamental than that. The uncertainty principle is closely linked to the wave-particle duality, which is at the heart of quantum mechanics. When we try to observe really fundamental small particles like electrons we find that sometimes they behave like particles and sometimes like waves. Waves and particles seem really different to us, like a baseball seems different from ocean waves, but this is because our brains perceive things at a much coarser level where this dual nature is not apparent. If two groups of waves pass over each other interference occurs. Some places the peaks of the waves in each group arrive at the same time and add together making a larger wave, other places a trough from one group lands on top of a peak from the other group and cancels out making a flat spot. This causes an interference pattern. This interference pattern can be observed with light but more surprisingly it can also be observed with electrons. For years the behavior of light was explained by assuming that light was a wave. Diffraction and interference patterns can easily be observed in water waves as well as light. However Planck and Einstein discovered something odd, light is always emitted and absorbed in little packets now called photons. This is a granular, particle like behavior, you never find any half photons. Another young physicist, Louis De Broglie suggested that if light displayed this dual nature perhaps matter particles also had wavelike properties. This turned out to be true. This is the subject of the famous double slit experiments which you can find described many places on the Web if you are interested. This topic is really an amazing portal into another level of reality. I recommend Richard Feynamn\u2019s lecture on this,  It turns out that you can observe the wave nature of an electron or you can observe the particle nature of it but never both at once. If you have a setup where you can measure an interference pattern of an electron, its wave nature, you cannot localize it, determine the electrons position. If you do manage to pin down its position the interference pattern vanishes. Returning to the uncertainty principle: It turns out that knowing where something is going, knowing its momentum, is a wave property of the thing. Knowing its position is a particle property. We are comfortable with a particle concept like a baseball and a wave concept and so we try to create models based on these ideas to understand our world. But what we see in the sub atomic world is that these are both aspects of some more fundamental thing, aspects which cannot be simultaneously pinned down. When we say if you know very precisely where something is you cannot know much about where it is going it is because knowledge of one thing erases the reality of the other. It is kind of like there is a trading off between waveness and the particleness. ",
