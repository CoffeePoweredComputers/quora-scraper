            "answer_text": "please read the folling well, think about it deeply,remember you believe in different fields by their effect, do not you this gigantic univeres is created by Allah(God)?   The way to the reality of Allah (God) thru Science.  Introduction:    First of all I am not a cleric but a physicit,I am a believer with confidence, so I will do my best, with the scientific knowledge I humbly have, to give my idea about the reality of Allah(God). [So it is up to others to believe or not, I am not responsible for that. But to expose my point of view based on my own knowledge].  The concept of the God is ancient in the life of mankind. It represents a main element in the evolution of the history, since the human beings founded on the Earth. The natural phenomena around them motivate them to think about many of these surrounding phenomena, those frightening ones and pleasant ones. Accordingly, unman beings got to propose to each event or events responsible creature.Therefore, the God concept took many skeletons and pictures. So, there were God of the Sun, God of the moon and many fetish or idols .Although many prophets were sent to inform these people that there is one God who He created the everything, the heavens, the earth ,humankind and all kind of animals, different shapes and colors. Of course, it is not easy for human being to believe in what he cannot see and touch. But during the mankind history thousands of prophets and messengers were sent, some people believe in their messages and some people did not.Therefore, there are now believers and non believers in the present world.Also, the prophets some sent to his people or to his nation, like Noah, Hood, Salish, Abraham, Loot ,Jacob, Josef, Moses and Jesus. We can understand their messages by reading the true Torah [ (the Ten Commandments given to MOSES behind the TUR Mountain in Sina)],and the Bible[(Jesus Instructions to sons of Jacob(Israel=God servant)]not the bibles(4 or 5) written by different people ,with some differences here and there. And the important reference to all the previous Allah (God) messages to mankind is the Qura'an (Islam message book, revealed to prophet Mohammed 611 AC).In the Torah and the Bible, the Mohammed coming as the final messenger to mankind is mentioned, but it was hidden by, Rabi and Pops, because the religion became way of governing and economical source to these people. This information has been pointed out many times by videos in the west. Finally, the religions in the world related to Allah (God) now are: 1-Judism. 2-Christianity. 3- Islam. Others ways of thinking or disciplines of life relations and traditions are products of certain thinkers, who interact with societies affairs and the way people living, but do not touch  what people used to believe in. These are not religion but cultural tradition with certain ritual exercises .Therefore, it is not consider a kind of religions. Also, the doctrines of certain ritual related to different sects of a religion are not new religion, such as Sunite, Sheite, protestant, Catholics and Mormon, etc. Although, the Torah and Bible as defined before are books contains so many verses about life and creatures but very little about the details of the creations in general. To me I consider that is natural, because it is up to the evolution of the mankind mentality and perspective. Therefore, I will take the Qura'an to find out what in fact shows that Allah(God)is a reality in the sense He Shows us He who created the Universe and we as Part of this Universe. This will be clarified as far as possible in the following paragraphs. Are the Qur'an Words of Allah? To answer this very important question, one has to find out the reasoning for his answer from the Qura'an itself. Also it is important to have an idea about the knowledge level of science and technology at the time when the Qura'an was inspired to Prophet Mohammed(pray and peace up on him).That was between 611 and623 after Christ(AC), also the Qur'an was written, and it is only one since that time till now(2015 AC ).  So, this was 1392 years ago, the question, for the sake of arguments, how the science and technology status was at that time?. If one goes through the history of science and technology does he find that?: 1-The Universe (heavens and earth) was one (sewen) ,then are separated(hernia). 2-The Universe (Heavens) is expanding. 3-The Universe (Heavens) are raised without pillars can usually seen by us. 4-That one day the whole Universe will be rolled back to the beginning point of its first creation, and then recreated as before. 5-One day the earth will be another one and the heavens too. 6-The Mountains which are tied to the earth to balance it, are moving, but not seen by us. Why hey are not seen by us? 7-The stars, planets and moon, each moving in a certain orbit. 8-There are certain stars, click, and giving sound like clocks (pulsars). 9-the human beings are created out of soil, then out of sperm, then out of a leech-like clot, then out of morsel of flesh, partly formed and partly unformed,inorder that manifests The power of the creator and cause him to rest in the wombs, for appointed term, then be brought out as a babes 10-Or the sperm is made into colt of congealed blood, then of that clot a feotus lump made, then out of that lumps bones, and clothed the bones with flesh, out of this another creator created. 11- Time is relative and the position too; it depends on the moving frame and the observing one. All these statements were stated in general in the Qura'an 1393 years ago, where none of these were known to mankind by any means. The Creeks and other civilizations have no idea what so ever about these scientific concepts. There were very trivial and na\u00efve ideas about the sun, the moon and earth, most likely a general philosophical thoughts. In the fifteen century it was thought the solar system is fixed, each in a fixed position, no Idea about universe or even our galaxy (Milky Way), then Copernicus Suggested the earth is the center, which was found not true but the sun is the center, e.t.c. Also is not true?.Therefore, no clear pictures about the universe till the nineteen century, but also not quite real, it was thought it is a static one, Einstein until 1929 was insisting that the universe is static. But in 1929 Hubel, using his telescope, found the universe is expanding, the galaxies are moving away from us. Remember in 1929 found the universe is expanding as it was stated before1393 years ago. Then in 1998 the expansion of the universe is not uniform. In the forties the big bang theory of the beginning of the universe was postulated, that is the universe was a kind of singular point with high density and very high temperature and pressure, then banged suddenly and gradually everything is created as it seen now. What was before the big bang? It is under so many proposed theories, like inflation (which is not clear is it before the big bang or after the big bang within 10^-32 sec.!!) and the string theories, all these are not yet with the unanimity of the scientific community. And still the question stands still what is before the scalar field of the inflaton, the particle proposed to the scalar field? The answer is nobody knows that, maybe there is need for new physics to solve this mastery of the universe as those theoretical physicist hope. The Status of the Universe Now A- According to the present theories of the cosmology mentioned before, the status of the universe now and the expected future can be summarized in the followings: 1-It is created by the Big Bang, 13.82 billion years ago. It was one point in vacuum space. 2- It is expanding to a certain time, and then either comes back under the effect of gravitation force to its point of the beginning and re-Big bang again, or goes expanding for a point where everything separated and flying away with a velocity faster than the velocity of light. In this case it means it is in the point of its beginning too. 3-These theories, although some observations confirm some of their predictions, but they still far away from the exact knowing what is really is before the big bang, or the inflation in case the inflation is an introduction to the big bang event. Regardless of this, the general concept and features of these theories are comparable to the idea of the universe creation and its evolution to a certain time and then crunched back to its beginning and big bang a gain as pointed out in the Qura'an, as it will be seen next. B-From the theory of relativity (1905, 1915) it is proved that: 1-Time is relative, not absolute; it depends on the frame of reference of the observer, there is a dilation timeline. So time in moving object is slower than that in fixed status.  2-So, in the moving systems with a velocity close to light velocity the relativistic physic has to be applied. 3-Position also relative 4-No simultaneity Now what did the Qura'an say about the mentioned scientificstatements and theories 620 AC (1395) years ago.Below the Sorats and the verses that clarify to us what the Qura'an, Sorats and verses, stated about these scientific proposed theories. 1-Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation) before we clove them a sunder?, we made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe>?(verse 30, Sorat Al Anbiya) 2-The day that we roll up the heavens like scroll rolled up for books(completed)-even as we produced the first creation, so shall we produce a new one, promise we have undertaken truly shall we fulfill it.(verse 104, Sorat Al-Anbiya). 3-Allah is He who raised the heavens without pillars that ye can see( verse 2, Sorat Al-Raad) 4-Allah is He who created seven firmament and of the earth similar number through the midst of them (all) descends his command that ye may know that Allah has power over all things and that Allah comprehends all things in His knowledge (verse 12, Sorat Al-Talaq). 5-Verily a Day in the sight of the Lord(Allah) is like a thousand years of your reckoning (verse42, Sorat Al-Hajj) 6-The heavens (skies) are constructed by our mighty and we expanding them (verse 47, Sorat Al-Thariyat). I will be satisfied with these seven verses which show that the Qura'an Sorats and verses words cannot be words of human beings who at that time know nothings clear about these scientific statements. There remain many verses in different Sorats show many statements supporting that the Qura'an is Allah Words. So the conclusion is quite clear, that the Qura'an is in fact is containing Allah words and Sentences Who is the creator of the universe and everything in it, also Who He created the rules, the laws and the mechanisms of the creation and the evolution of the universe and its constituents.Therefore, we can understand the universe up to what we are knowledge to do so. It is not permitted to us to fully understand the God(Allah)mentality and His exact identity, because He describes Himself as nothing similar to him, He created the human being as is in the human picture now. God (Allah) picture is materially not defined by him as may thing some clerics of different real religions. Finally, I hope I have done what might be clear and useful to whom he wants to know the others point of view. I know it is not easy for some people to recognize something's they do not see or touch. Although we believe in things we do not see them or touch direct but by their effects. ",

            "answer_text": "Gods need not be in the image of man. From a logical point of view, it would have been better if god(s), as we know it, had been built this way. But since we made it this far, it isn\u2019t a bad set of training wheels. I will try to explain why. We formulate fundamental assumptions about the world that we carry with us to predict the world so that we can live safely in it. If there is a lion in the dark, and we can smell it, then it would be understandable to assume that it may be there and avoid it. Then again, if we are standing in a tar pit, sinking, we might consider taking a chance that the lion might not be there. Then again, even if there is no tar pit, when properly armed, we sometimes venture into the dark because we wish to protect our loved ones, or we are feeling brave, curious, or simply foolish. Life is complicated and full of unknowns, and sometimes, an easy answer is better than no answer at all, and understandably for some, more preferable than an equally complicated answer. We seek comfort because it is safe, but not always. The universe seems to be made up of the same stuff everywhere. When we look at one part of the sky, then another, they all have the same bottom line color to it. That is kinda crazy when you think about it, and curiously predictably boring at the same time. It means that there is some fundamental universal constant that is everywhere, and may have existed forever. If it exists always, and is everywhere, isn\u2019t that the properties of a god? Why do gods have to speak English in the heads of only specific people? Why couldn\u2019t gods be observable from anywhere by anyone and requires no churches or taxes? The universe\u2019s color doesn\u2019t seem to care whether or not we are here. We could destroy our planet and it would not change a single digit on the constant. A single electron hit with a quanta of energy and changes its level. An equation tells us that a number can go on forever and never repeat. All of this valid and true forever, since ever, seemingly everywhere. Is any of this god? No minister, monk, priest, etc. that I\u2019ve ever talked to has grasp these observations and fit them conveniently into their own model of the world in a useful way. \u201cScience\u201d is just a process. It is no different than a process for brushing your teeth or adding two numbers. We made it all up. If we don\u2019t like the scientific process, we can change it into something that is more useful, as long as we deem it useful. The scientific process seems to place god in the realm of hypothesis, with the expected probability of confirmation shrinking with each passing moment. Name anything in our world, where the more powerful our tools get, the less we seem to be able to prove it. I\u2019ll name it; the universe. Catholics call their faith Catholicism, which basically means universal, or the universe. I sometimes wonder why they don\u2019t take inspiration from their own words. I don\u2019t think that this necessarily means anything. The very idea of universal, or \u201cuniverse\u201d is also something we made up. What came first? Words? Or god(s)\u2019 words? What matters more? Be a person worthy of god or sacrificing everything in god\u2019s name? We make our own heavens because we can and have made our own hells. I see god(s) everywhere, and nowhere. The idea is certainly convenient and useful for some purposes, but usually isn\u2019t the most effective tool to rely on. Want to know if your investments are going to go up? Is it god? What if it goes down? Okay, does the answer help you the next day? If it does, then it isn\u2019t bad. If it doesn\u2019t, maybe reconsider. We associate what we cannot face or explain for ourselves today with the divine so that we can go to sleep at night. When the sun rises the next day, we will have to face the great unknown all over again. Oh, god. ",
