            "answer_text": "The key here is that we think the lone pairs should occupy two sp3 hybrid orbitals because there are four regions of electron density around oxygen, however the reality is that one pair occupies one unhybridized p orbital and the other occupies a hybrid sp2 orbital (which is the definition of sp2 hybridization). WHY is that, though? Because the lone pair of electrons occupying the unhybridized p orbital would now be available to participate in delocalization across the ring, as a result of the overlap of adjacent p orbitals across the ENTIRE ring. This is more favorable than the lone pair occupying an sp3 hybrid orbital because electron-electron repulsion between adjacent sp3 orbitals would be destabilizing (remember that charges of same charge are repulsive).  Comments open for discussion, as always. -AEM ",

            "answer_text": "As we already know furan is aromatic. So conditions necessary for aromaticity must be fulfil by the molecule. If the oxygen is sp3 hybridised the lone pairs would not be in a orbital perpendicular to the ring. Then resonance condition is not satisfied and there would be no delocalization. However if oxygen is sp2 then one lone pair is in orbital perpendicular to the ring and resonance occurred. Therefore oxygen must be sp2 hybridised not sp3. ",
