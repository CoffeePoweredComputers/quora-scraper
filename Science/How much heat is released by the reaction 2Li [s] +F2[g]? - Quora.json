            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t give the product, so it\u2019s impossible to be 100% accurate. But on the assumption that the \u201cusual\u201d product is obtained in a laboratory setting, 2Li (s) + F2 (g) \u2192 2 LiF (s) This is precisely the standard reaction of formation for the compound LiF, that is the reaction that produces the compound in its standard state from its elements in their standard state. Looking up the standard enthalpy of formation for LiF, I found two very similar values on line: -612 kJ/mol and -616 kJ/mol. Since the reaction above produces two moles of LiF, the overal enthalpy would be twice the enthalpy of formation, so -1224 kJ or -1232 kJ. There was another answer that gave something like -676 kJ/mol but that was for formation of LiF (g), which is quite a different beast. I\u2019m surprised that value is even more negative than the enthalpy of formation of the solid. I would expect it to be less negative by the heat of vaporization (since some of the heat released by the formation of the solid would have to be \u201cgiven back\u201d to vaporize the product. ",
