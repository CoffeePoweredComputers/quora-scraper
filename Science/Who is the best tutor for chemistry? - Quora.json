            "answer_text": "I would imagine it depends on what level course you are taking at this time, however the college usually finds you help with the T.A. through the Department. If you are taking it online, I would check credentials as far as how long ago one studied or practiced in Industry. Chemistry was always a favorite of mine early on in my academic career. I loved H.S. Chemistry college Chemistry classes were huge and sometimes one can get lost early in the Semester. Being prepared with a study group, especially in Organic is a PLUS++++. There are many changes and watching \u201cthe big Bang Theory\u201d is all fun, but when it comes to the periodic table of elements find an expert! Google it, but first look on campus. Sometimes, no often there are GRAD students who have a fresher recall and can explain the formulas better than the advanced professors who have so many to teach. A one on one session will let you know right away if you click with your Tutor! Good Luck! I do not have websites for you today. Check with Chemistry Professors for that one! ",

This is basically why we started TUTR. (www.tutr.co). We want to provide an app that gives students like yourself a chance to find a tutor instantly from anywhere (home,library,etc.) and at any time 24/7 through a simple app. We will give you a shout when we launch in August so you can find tutors from all subjects instantly. Sorry we weren\u2019t more help now, but we will be soon ;) ",
