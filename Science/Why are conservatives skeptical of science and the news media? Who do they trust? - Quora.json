            "answer_text": "Right-wingers only trust Trump, FOX News, OAN, conspiracy websites, and Right-wing radio celebrities such as Rush Limbaugh all of whom are proven dispensers or misinformation, lies, and hate, and big Trump supporters. These are the people like the Republican Congressional representative, when speaking of rape, claimed, that a woman can\u2019t get pregnant if she doesn\u2019t want to. And these are the people, most if not all of whom, that don\u2019t believe in climate change yet believe Trump when he says it\u2019s nothing more than a Chinese hoax to sell us more stuff. By the way, Trump is the same guy who consistently comes up with unique ways for fighting the rising number and intensity of hurricanes and tornados, his scientific answer, simply drop a hydrogen bomb on them, and as for medical advice for addressing COVID, he has an answer for that too, just drink bleach and stick a high-intensity light bar up your ass in order to get \u201cbiggly\u201d amounts of UV rays. And of course, there is Trump\u2019s push that we take hydroxychloroquine, the same drug that has killed COVID patients. that the medical community has told him and us is not to be used except for cases of miliaria. And speaking of COVID, Trump is the guy that has been in denial about the virus from the outset, even though we know from the Woodward tapes, that as early as Jan. 28th, he knew all about the problem in granular detail but elected to keep us in the dark, in fact even worse, by suggesting it was nothing more than the flu and it would go away with warm weather. And only yesterday Trump was telling his supporters that we have \u201c turned the corner beautifully on COVID\u201d as the country hit an all-time high of 83,010 infections during the previous day while the number of deaths passed 225,000 with no end in sight. When it comes to belief in our established institutions, the FBI, our courts, our qualified and professional federal workers, the one's Trump mislabel as the deep state, the NYT, and WaPo, two of the most trusted, honest, and respected news sources in the world, the right-wing Trump supporters\u2019 answer when asked if they trust them, their answer is a resounding, NEVER! Never science, never facts, never evidence, never anyone but Trump, his sycophants, and enablers, and never the truth! ",

            "answer_text": "I personally have seen too many \u201cscientists\u201d (and I use the term loosely) far too willing to put forth a message that is clearly politically biased. Many people are willing to accept whatever someone calling themselves a \u201cscientist\u201d says because, after all, they are a scientist. I got kicked out of Catholic school at five years of age after spending an hour or so talking with the head nun about creation, the Big Bang and other sciencey sorts of stuff. I believe I am well qualified to sort out the crap from good stuff when it comes to a great deal of scientific thought. I won\u2019t get into a full bio here, but let\u2019s just say I am a pretty smart guy with a lot of experience in a lot of different areas. And people pay me for that. There was a guy named Lysenko that should be well known to people - but he isn\u2019t for obvious reasons. He was a scientist that promoted ideas that weren\u2019t quite right - and led much of European genetic thinking astray for decades. We got over him, just as we will get over some of the \u201cscientific\u201d types that are out there now. I have utterly no respect for anyone that uses their popular position in the media to distort science to fit there political beliefs and agenda. One specific example is Neil Degrasse Tyson. Climate change? Sure, we could use some real science in being injected into that. Much of what purports to be \u201csettled science\u201d on that front is political. The truth is out there, but you have to really dig into it. One of the most startling things is that it is clear CO2 is a trailing, not leading, indication of warming. I won\u2019t say that it doesn\u2019t matter how much humans pump into the atmosphere, but for the last 150 years there has been a clear trade-off: CO2 and energy or less CO2 and less energy. We are now at a point where a stable electric supply could - if we wanted to - replace much of what is called fossil fuel usage. But what we are seeing is a huge push to reduce energy usage across the board. In 1850 humans used a lot less energy and the standard of living showed it. Do we really want to turn the clock back? Really? The current pandemic? It is a made-to-order crisis for the political folks that really, really want a crisis. When people are frightened, they will accept almost anything that will make the fear go away. Joe Biden is clearly the answer on that front - he will make the fear go away. All those pesky things like \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201crights\u201d might be affected a tiny bit, but you weren\u2019t using them anyway, were you? Yes, there is a pandemic of a nearly non-fatal disease that is pretty hard to catch. If it was that infective, we would have seen the country with a hundred million infected by March. Look at some projections of what the Black Plague would do if it was loose in a single large city today. With international air travel it would be everywhere. Now that disease is highly infective and without really swift and effective treatment it is at least 50% fatal. Why are our leaders treating this virus like Yersinia Pestis (aka The Black Plague)? Because it suits their political agenda. One of the \u201cleaders\u201d of this line of thinking seems to be Dr. Fauci who has been advising the Federal Government on disease since at least the 1980s where he rather badly mismanaged the government\u2019s response on AIDS or GRID as it was known when he got started with it. I firmly believe he advised against any sort of isolation, quarantine or identification of individuals so it could spread uncontrolled through much of the LGBTQ community. It has also sharply curtailed sexual freedom and permissiveness in ways that many, many people believe is beneficial for their agenda. So of course, a great deal of this has been political in nature. Who do I trust? Absolutely nobody in power. Look at their history - they got where they are by deceiving people and exploiting that deception. ",
