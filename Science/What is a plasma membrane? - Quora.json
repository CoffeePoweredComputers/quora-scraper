            "answer_text": "Plasma membrane is a microscopic membrane of lipids and proteins which forms the external boundary of the cytoplasm of a cell or surrounds a vacuole, and controls the channel of molecules in and out of the cytoplasm. Its function is to separate the substance of the cell from its outside environment and it controls what enters and exits the cell. Plasma membrane plays an essential role in protecting the integrity of the interior of the cell by allowing only selected substances into the cell and keeping other substances out. Plasma membrane is embedded with many proteins. It is made of two layers of phospholipids. Cholesterol it preserves the fluidity of cell surface membrane Plasma Membrane ",

            "answer_text": "Plasma membrane is the outermost covering of animal cell. It is made up of both lipids and proteins i.e lipoproteins . It has a bilayer structure,one layer is hydrophilic in nature while the other one is hydrophobic in nature. Plasma membrane r of different types such as they r freely permeable or semi permeable or selectively \\U0001f446\\U0001f3fb. It depends on the organism. Plasma membrane is protective in function and it provides a proper shape and size to the cell body . It protects the inner organelles from any damage. write this answer and u will score out off \\U0001f605\\U0001f600\\U0001f604 ",
