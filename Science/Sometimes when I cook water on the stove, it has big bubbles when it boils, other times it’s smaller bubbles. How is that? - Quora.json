            "answer_text": "PART 1 - ORIGINAL ANSWER. PICTURES FROM INTERNETPART 2- TEST DONE AT HOME TO SEE IF THE THEORY IS RIGHT, WITH MY OWN PICTURES PART 1 - ORIGINAL ANSWER. PICTURES FROM INTERNET Look closer, and you will probably see the small bubbles in the beginning, and the larger bubbles later on when the water is boiling. Ps: In the end of this answer, I will tell something of the taste of water! The small bubbles are air, which is pressed out of the water when it is heating:  The larger bubbles come when the water has reached 100 degrees Celcius, which is the temperature where the vapor pressure of water is higher than the atmospheric pressure. Here the bubbles contain water vapor:  Also when applying further heat to the pot, the water can not exceed 100 degrees Celcius. In stead, the water is waporasing more quickly. This leads to larger bubbles, until you nearly do not see any bubbles at all due to so much water vaporising at the same time. The foamlike bubbling contains water vapor too:  Ps. about the taste of water: Do you think water has no taste? In some ways it does not, as it is neither sweet, sour, bitter, salty or umami. But most of you have tasted fresh, cold water, and also tasted water which you have boiled, cooled and then drunk. At places with the possibility to have germs in the water, it is usual to boil some water, cool it, put in the fridge and then drink it to ensure not being ill from germs in the water.If you have done so, you will know from experience the boiled water lacks the \u201cfresh-ness\u201d in taste which the non-boiled water has. If you do not believe me, make an experiment and boil some water, cool it and taste it, and compare it with some of the fresh, not boiled water! The reason for the \u201cfresh\u201d taste being gone in the boiled water, is due to the boiling expels the air from the water. It is the natural content of air in fresh water which makes the fresh cold water having the fresh taste! Have fun with your water! ;-) PART 2- TEST DONE AT HOME TO SEE IF THE THEORY IS RIGHT, WITH MY OWN PICTURES As somebody was doubting it actually being air in the small bubbles, I found to not be sure if it really was so. Because of this, I decided to make a test myself to see if the small bubbles went away after the water had been boiled, or if the small bubbles would reappear when the boiled and cooled water was heated again. The test was taking some fresh water, heating it until it was boiling, cooling it down and heating it till boiling again. Photographing the different stages, and by this seeing and photographing how it looked when fresh water was boiled, and when pre-boiled and cooled water was boiled. This picture shows the heating stage of fresh water. It kept having those small bubbles during all the heating including when the larger vapor-bubbles appeared:  Now the fresh water has started to make the bigger vapor bubbles, at 1 o\u2019clock. The small air bubbles are not gone:  Starting to boil more, we see the large vapor bubbles t several places, but still see some of the small bubbles:  And this picture shows when it fully boiling, the picture got a bit foggy because of the steam condensing on the lens:  Then I cooled the water, and put it on the stove again heating it to boil. This time there were nearly none of those small bubbles before the boiling occured.This picture is from the heating stage of the pre-boiled and cooled water. None of the small bubbles appeared:  Then the boiling started. This picture is from an early stage of the boiling of the pre-boiled and cooled water, and we can see some of the large vapor bubbles coming. Those large bubbles are at 12 o\u2019clock and one bubble at about 2 o\u2019clock. Still there are no small bubbles:  A little later in the boiling of the pre-boiled and cooled water, when there are more vapor bubbles in the water. The vapor bubbles are at 12 o\u2019clock, 2 o\u2019clock and 10 - 11 o\u2019clock. Still there are none of the small bubbles:  This means the test showed the small bubbles when heating the fresh water are no longer coming when the water had been boiled, cooled and boiled again. At least I have had fun with my water! ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "The geometry of the pot in terms of how much pressure or \u2018head\u2019, or height of water is pushing down on the pot bottom as a certain amount of heat is applied to the bottom of the pot. Large bubbles indicate a large surplus of heat causing steam generation. When you lower the heat, the bubbles become smaller which is why recipes refer to bringing something to a \u2018rapid boil\u2019 or a \u2018simmer\u2019 which is another way to describe the relative size of the bubbles as a way of seeing a relative temperature without having to actually measure its\u2019 value. Also the accumulation of silica or lime carbonate deposits on the bottom of the pot can interfere with heat transfer, until it is scoured off to a bright finish. Cooks realize that the type of liquid can cause differing times of boil, but that boiling will occur, so they don\u2019t stress over the differences, they just specify how violent the boiling should be and tell you to look for that as a sign it is time to do one thing or another to the food being prepared.
