            "answer_text": "Water is a good example. The oxygen is electronegative and the 2 hydrogens are at about 105 degrees. The oxygen causes the 0-H bonds to not be symmetrical, the electron densities are closer to the O than the H so the O part has a slight negative charge, whereas the area of the 2 H\u2019s is slightly positive, so there is charge separation\u2014i.e. polar.
