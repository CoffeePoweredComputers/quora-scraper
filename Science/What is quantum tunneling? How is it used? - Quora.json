If someone wanted to just read the Wiki article, then why he/she would ask the question on Quora. Simply answering a question is different, and actually making someone understanding the answer is different... Anyways.... Let me try and share my bit. Before we talk about quantum nature of particles and quantum tunneling, let's imagine a situation. Imagine you are standing at the foot of a hill, and you wanted to go to the other side of the hill.  Image source: self drawn. Only way to do that is to climb the hill to the top, and then come down slowly at the other side. But climbing a hill requires a lot of energy, isn't it. What if you are weak and you don't have that much energy. Can you still go to the other of hill? It appears that there is another way to go to the other side without climbing the hill. Trains usually cross the hills without climbing, you can do that too. You can search or look for tunnel, and then go through that tunnel to reach the other side of the hill without climbing it. If you could successfully find and cross the tunnel, then you can cross the hill, even if you don't have enough energy to climb.  Image source: self drawn. Quantum World and Quantum Tunneling: At the quantum level, the laws of physics are no more same as the normal physics laws which we see in our daily life. Many strange things happens at quantum level. For example, lets say you are playing snooker in our macroscopic world, so can you expect a particular snooker ball to disappear at one place, and suddenly appear at other place. It can't happen, right. In order to change the place, the ball has to roll over to that place on table. But, at quantum level, particle disappear at one place and appear at other place immediately. Another example would be a classical myth, which says that electrons revolve around the atom. Where as in reality at quantum level, electrons do not orbit at all. An electron simply disappears and appears in it's probabilistic cloud, based on it's energy level. So, when we dig more into quantum level, we see that it is full of probabilities. Example - 1S orbital of Hydrogen is just a region in circular shape where the probability of finding a electron is high. So, it is all about probabilities. Can you find an electron in 2s or 3s orbital of an hydrogen? Answer would be, yeah may be but with very less probability, if that electron can have very high energy. After all orbitals are just energy levels, and not some physically defined regions. Probability might be near to zero, but it is not zero. And this changes everything at quantum level. Now let's talk about Quantum Tunneling.We now know that particles can disappear and appear immediately. Remember the situation where you wanted to cross the hill (image above). Now, imagine that instead of you, a particle is standing there, and instead of a hill, there is a potential barrier or energy barrier. In simple terms, an energy barrier is a limit which tells that the particle must possess that much energy to cross it. It is just a energy level, and not some physical hill at atomic scale. Analogy of energy level would be like a night club. Let's say there is a night club where particles can hang around and enjoy. Night club requires 50$ to give entry. And the 'particle x' has only 20$, so particle x would require another 30$ to get the entry inside club. But, the particle cannot get extra money, his friends (other particles) also denied to lend some money (energy excitation) to particle x. There is still a chance that particle x can find a back door, and enter inside the club, without spending anything. But probability of finding a back door is very low. This is like Quantum Tunneling. When a particle appears at other side of the energy barrier without having the sufficient energy to cross the energy barrier. This phenomena is quantum tunneling, where it seems like the particle has tunneled through the energy barrier.  The probability of happening this is very low. Let's say if there are 1 million particles, then may be only 1 or 2 particle might be able to tunnel through the barrier and appear on other side. Application of Quantum TunnelingThe quantum tunneling is an experimentally confirmed and observed phenomena. But, one of it's application truly boggles my mind. Quantum tunneling has actually enabled us to visualize the atoms and molecules itself. It's like looking at the molecules and atoms under a microscope. Scanning Tunneling Microscope, for which physicists Gerd K. Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer were awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986. STM complete mechanism can't be discussed here, but it works on the underlying principle of quantum tunneling. Below are few images of molecules seen under STM.  Silicon atoms.

            "answer_text": "I think Vivek Keshore had provided a very intuitive picture about quantum tunneling. Here, I would like to say a few words about how quantum tunneling is used in optolectronic devices that adopted a quantum well structure. Two examples will be given: Quantum well solar cell (QW solar cell)In a solar cell, the photogenerated electrons and holes within a quantum well have to be collected near the p- and n-layer for powering a device. In fact, the efficiency of a solar cell is closely dependent on how well these photogenerated charge carriers are collected. To improve the charge transport within a QW solar cell, the barriers of the quantum well are made very thin (a few nano-meter) so that electrons created in the quantum well are more probable to tunnel across the barrier and to be collected at the n-layer. Quantum well cascade laserThe thicknesses of the well and barrier layers in a quantum well cascade laser can be tuned in achieving population inversion (an important criterion for lasing). Picture below shows the active regions of the laser which compose of three quantum wells.  Image source: self drawn Near the active region, electrons supplied by a current are injected into the first QW with energy level E[math]_{1}[/math] through resonant tunneling. This is essential to create a large population of electrons at E[math]_{1},[/math] the so-called population inversion. These electrons will then undergo spontaneous emission and de-excite into energy level E[math]_{2}[/math] (of the next quantum well), emitting photons. To maintain the population inversion, electrons at E[math]_{2} [/math]must have a short lifetime, so that they can quickly fall into E[math]_{3}[/math] at the next QW. This can be done by fine-tuning the barrier and well layers of QW so that quantum tunneling can be enhanced. So far, we have seen devices that use quantum tunneling in charge transport purpose and for creating population inversion. However, in some devices, quantum tunneling can be an unwanted effect. For example transistor that have been shrunk to the size of nano-meter range, quantum tunneling can cause the presence of current when the transistor is in a \u2018off\u2019 state, leading to extra power consumption. Another example is LED which is also adopting a multiple quantum well structure. In this case, quantum tunneling is suppressed by making the barrier width larger/barrier height taller, so that more electrons can be trapped within the well (instead of passing through) to achieve a greater luminescence. Note: Resonant tunneling can be understood by looking at resonant-tunneling diode[1] (another device that make use of quantum tunneling effect). Footnotes[1] Resonant-tunneling diode - Wikipedia",

            "answer_text": "Quantum tunneling depends upon the objective uncertainties required by quantum mechanics.  If you have a classical particle, and it doesn't have enough energy to get over a barrier that it encounters, it is reflected back.  It can't continue to move forward.  However when we apply quantum mechanical thinking to the same situation, it turns out that the position of any object can never be known exactly, and this is not just because our measuring instruments are not perfect.  Whenever the position of something is represented in QM, it is represented with a degree of uncertainty related to the degree of uncertainty in its momentum.  For things on human scales, these uncertainties can be incredibly small and totally ignorable.  For smaller particles, the uncertainties matter a lot. The uncertainty in position of the quantum particle as it reaches a barrier means that there is some probability that the particle is in fact on the other side.  This probability is seldom high, but sometimes it is, and even with low probability and a lot of particles reaching a barrier, some will get throw.  We say they tunneled through.  There is no real tunnel, this term just present a metaphor for something that doesn't exist in any theory of classical physics.  Here are some illustrations: Quantum Tunneling At one time the fact that he didn't take the possibility of tunneling into account, cost Ernest Lawrence a Nobel Prize that he would have had before the one he did get. He invented a versatile particle accelerator, called a cyclotron, and he used it to bombard various nuclei with protons and ions.  In some of these collisions, protons must have tunneled through the repulsive electrostatic barrier of the nuclei, but Lawrence didn't check for this, and Cockroft and Walton got the Nobel Prize for the first artificial transmutation of element, Ernest Lawrence I got to meet Walton I think in 1975 in an awards program for 5 of my students.

            "answer_text": "Having no classical counterpart, quantum tunneling is a valuable ramification of quantum mechanics. Let us consider a particle with energy E situated in the interior region of a one-dimensional potential well V(x). Now just to clarify, a potential well is a potential that bears a lower value in a certain sector of space relative to other regions within its vicinity. In classical physics, if E < V0 (V-naught) (the greatest possible height of the potential barrier), then the particle would remain in the well for all of eternity. On the contrary, if E > V0, the particle would escape. In quantum mechanics, however, the solutions are not as basic. There is a chance that the particle will escape even in the case of its energy E being below the height of the barrier V0, but, the likelihood of escaping is relatively small with the exception of E being close to V0. If such is the to be deemed true, the particle may \u2018tunnel\u2019 through the potential barrier and come out with the same amount of energy E. Quantum tunneling has a copious amount of applications. For one, it provides an explanation for a type of radioactive decay in which a nucleus emits an alpha particle. According to renowned physicists Edward Condon, George Gamow, and Ronald W. Gurney, the alpha particle is confined prior to decay by a certain potential. When provided a specific nuclear species, one could calculate the energy E of the emitted alpha particle and the lifetime \u03c4 of the nucleus before decay. The lifespan of the nucleus is a measure of the likeliness of tunneling through the barrier. If the lifetime is shortened, a higher chance of it tunneling shall become apparent. With all reasonable assumptions regarding the general form of the potential function considered, it is feasible to computate a certain relationship between \u03c4 and E \u2014 one that is relevant to all alpha emitters. Birthed as a consequence of experimentation, this theory demonstrates that the probability of tunneling is extremely responsive to the E\u2019s value. For all known alpha-particle emitters, the E quantity differs on a scale of approximately 2 to 8 million electron volts. Therefore, the values of E are bounded within a factor of 4. On the other hand, for \u03c4, the range is anywhere from 10^-6 seconds to 10^11 years \u2014 a factor of 10^24 (how crazy is that?!). The theory of quantum tunneling best describes this level of sensitivity of \u03c4 to the value of E. ",

            "answer_text": "Quantum tunneling is an effect which cannot be explained using classical physics. While a barrier, such as an electric potential, would classically prevent a particle from occupying a certain region of space; under quantum physics, the particle can appear. It seems to have tunneled through the barrier. The most practical example of tunneling is the Tunnel diode.  The tunnel diode can be used for extreme high frequency amplifiers. In 1977, the Intelsat V satellite receiver used a microstrip tunnel diode amplifier (TDA) front-end in the 14 to 15.5 GHz frequency band. Such amplifiers were considered state-of-the-art, with better performance at high frequencies than any transistor-based front end. The highest frequency room-temperature solid-state oscillators are based on the resonant-tunneling diode (RTD). The tunneling effect is pehaps less obvious but at work in the Zener diode. Other instances of tunneling include: Alpha decay which is familiar from the clicks of a Geiger counter and Carbon dating (where the age of material is estimated by the amount of Carbon 14 in a sample) are two relatively well known examples of effects which depend on quantum tunneling. The alpha particle is trapped in a potential well by the nucleus. Classically, it is forbidden to escape, but according to the (then) newly discovered principles of quantum mechanics, it has a tiny (but non-zero) probability of \"tunneling\" through the barrier and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus. Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived, from first principles, a relationship between the half-life of the decay, and the energy of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically, and was known as the Geiger\u2013Nuttall law and Carbon-14 decays with a half life of about 5730 years by the emission of an electron of energy 0.016 MeV. This changes the atomic number of the nucleus to 7, producing a nucleus of nitrogen-14. At equilibrium with the atmosphere, a gram of carbon shows an activity of about 15 decays per minute. ",
