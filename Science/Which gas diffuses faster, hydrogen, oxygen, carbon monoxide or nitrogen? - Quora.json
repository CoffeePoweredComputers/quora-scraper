            "answer_text": "According to Graham's law of diffusion, the rate of diffusion or movement of gas is inversely proportional to the square root of it's molecular weight. Among H2 , O2 , CO, and N2 , the gas with least mass is hydrogen. So hydrogen diffuses faster whereas oxygen takes long time to diffuse. THANK YOU! ",
