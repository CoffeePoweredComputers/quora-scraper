            "answer_text": "Hept-1-ene Easy to name since it is a straight chain molecule (indicated by the fact that there are no brackets). The chain consists of 7 carbon atoms, thus hept. The only special functional group is the double bond at the end of the chain, carbon-1. You might argue that the bond can also be on carbon-6 (if you count the oyher way round). But in IUPAC naming, we favour the use of smaller numbers. The double bond indicates that the molecule is al alkene, thus -ene. Combine all of the above and you get hept-1-ene. ",

            "answer_text": "Steps to be follow:~ 1)Select long carbon chain 2)You may known that (Carbon chain<double bond or alkene) alkene has high priority 3)Then start numbering with high priority group that is double bond or alkene 4)You may known that we write about alkene then you may go with least count Example - Hept-1-ene Correct But Hept-2- ene is going to be wrong Incorrect #So follow this tip and step by step answering it. Good luck May God bless you Thanks~ ",
