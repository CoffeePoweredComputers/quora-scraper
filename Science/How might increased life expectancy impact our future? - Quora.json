            "answer_text": "The major limitation right now is brain longevity. Just like all organs and systems fall to entropy and start failing, the brain also fails. We call it dementia. One in six people above 80 years has dementia. There is the possibility of organ cloning and transplant. We could produce organs with the same DNA of the host and transplant to him. We could transplant aditional pancreas, kidneys and other organs. Maybe even hearts and lungs. There could also be mechanical devices to aid heart pumping.  This is a device that can be used for severe heart failure while the patient awaits a heart transplant. New devices could be created to help heart function indefinitely. Potentialy we would be able to create any organ and transplant it. Genetic engineering is also a possibility, but I dont see it working in adults. That is probabily a benefit for kids who are engineered. The problem lies in the brain. Neurons have a long life span and some of then can be as long as one meter.  There are cells that go all the way from the brain to the spinal cord. There is no easy way to trasplant a brain because its cells arent contained just to the skull. So, transplanting a brain to a new body would require reatachment of a lot of neurons or use of an eletronic device which creates an artificial anatomic bridge. There could be a way to repair neurons while we transplant new organs, but we are far from that. What we can do is understand aging and try to reduce body entropy and degeneration so we could stop system from achieving complete failure and, eventualy, death. Until about 60 years ago most deaths were due to infectious diseases. Nowadays we have cancer and cardiovascular diseases as the most important. As we increase our ability to prevent diseases and create new therapies we will be able to add a few decades. ",

            "answer_text": "From http://www.sramanamitra.com/2016/12/02/the-future-the-problem-with-longevity/ on the One Million by One Million blog: We are extending life expectancy by leaps and bounds through the miracles of science and technology. Today, longevity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean quality of life. It means, simply, surviving to a much older age. Given the march of progress in the medical sciences, it may be safe to assume that over time, quality of life will also increase in the later years of life. As geriatric diseases become treatable, and even curable in certain cases, long life may also become more enjoyable through better health. But there are other problems with longevity.  In a world with fast declining number of jobs, as it is people are struggling to find employment. Youth unemployment has become a major problem. As of July 2016, youth unemployment rate in Greece stands at 50.3%. Spain is at 43.9%. Italy is at 39.2%. France is at 24.4%. It\u2019s a dreadful, tragic story of several lost generations. Idle youth is a tremendous economic burden that the world is already reeling from. Add to that increasing populations of older people who are also idle. Now, we\u2019re looking at 30-40 years of idle, retired years that human beings have to live through. May be more. Is this desirable? I can tell you that I have no interest in living very long. The day my independent, productive, high impact life is over, I\u2019d like to say goodbye and move on. And for that, an essential piece of philosophy: just like the right to live is an accepted human right, so should be the right to die. I want to die when I choose to, and society needs to make it possible and easy for me to make that choice. ",
