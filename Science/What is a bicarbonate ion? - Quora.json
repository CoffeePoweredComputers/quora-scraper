            "answer_text": "Chemical Concepts Demonstrated: Chemistry of HCO3- ion, acid-base reactions, LeChatelier's Principle Demonstration: Three balloons are attached to three bottles as shown in the picture. All of the balloons contain Alka-Seltzer.The first bottle contains 250 ml of water.The second bottle contains 250 ml of water and 3 ml of HCl.The third bottle contains 100 ml of water and 150 ml of a soft drink. Drop the alka-seltzer into the bottles. Observations: The more acidic the solution, the larger the amount of CO2 gas is produced. These amounts can easily be measured by comparing the resulting size of the balloons. The plain water produces the least amount of gas, the water and hydrochloric acid produces a moderate amount, and the water and soft drink produce the most gas. Explanation (including important chemical equations): HCO3- (aq) + H+ (aq) <=> H2CO3 (aq) <=> H2O(l) + CO2 (g) HCl is a stronger acid than water. Larger amounts of acid will increase the acidity of the solution and push the reaction towards the production of products (i.e. more acidity yields more CO2 gas). In medical point of view. the accumulation of acid and hydrogen ions or depletion of the alkaline reserve (bicarbonate content) in the blood and body tissues, resulting in a decrease in pH. 2. a pathologic condition resulting from this process, characterized by increase in hydrogen ion concentration (decrease in pH). The optimal acid-base balance is maintained by chemical buffers, biologic activities of the cells, and effective functioning of the lungs and kidneys. The opposite of acidosis is alkalosis. adj., adj acidot\u00b4ic. Acidosis usually occurs secondary to some underlying disease process; the two major types, distinguished according to cause, are metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis (see accompanying table). In mild cases the symptoms may be overlooked; in severe cases symptoms are more obvious and may include muscle twitching, involuntary movement, cardiac arrhythmias, disorientation, and coma. In general, treatment consists of intravenous or oral administration of sodium bicarbonate or sodium lactate solutions and correction of the underlying cause of the imbalance. Many cases of severe acidosis can be prevented by careful monitoring of patients whose primary illness predisposes them to respiratory problems or metabolic derangements that can cause increased levels of acidity or decreased bicarbonate levels. Such care includes effective teaching of self-care to the diabetic so that the disease remains under control. Patients receiving intravenous therapy, especially those having a fluid deficit, and those with biliary or intestinal intubation should be watched closely for early signs of acidosis. Others predisposed to acidosis are patients with shock, hyperthyroidism, advanced circulatory failure, renal failure, respiratory disorders, or liver disease. ",
