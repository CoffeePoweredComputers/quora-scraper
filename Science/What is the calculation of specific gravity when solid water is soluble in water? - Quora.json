            "answer_text": "Solid water (ice) is not soluble in liquid water. Ice must melt to be mixed with the already liquid water. A substance is not typically said to be soluble in itself. That makes no sense. How could you identify the H2O molecules that were initially part of the solid-phase and those that were initially part of the liquid phase? Ice does have a specific gravity. It is the ratio of the density of the ice divided by the density of water at 4 deg. C. The density of ice is typically taken to be 0.9168 gm/cc. At 4 deg. the density of water is 1.000 gm/cc. That makes ice have a density of 0.9168, which is a unitless number. ",
