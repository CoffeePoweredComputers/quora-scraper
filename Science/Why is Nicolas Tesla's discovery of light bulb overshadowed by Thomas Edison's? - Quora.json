            "answer_text": "Tesla\u2019s lighting equipment used Carbon Arc technology as opposed to Edison\u2019s incandescent technology. Carbon arc bulbs produce a lot of light, but much of the light they put out is ultraviolet - and therefore the bulbs are unusable for indoor lighting. They also use a lot more power than any other lighting technology. Carbon arc bulbs were used in streetlights, gymnasium lighting and the graphic arts\u2026and as soon as a better technology came out, the people using carbon arc lighting converted to the better lighting almost immediately. Tesla\u2019s lighting equipment has been overshadowed by Edison\u2019s because no one wants carbon arc lighting anymore. ",
