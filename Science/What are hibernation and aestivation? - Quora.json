            "answer_text": "Hibernation is going into suspended animation during the winter. Typically, metabolic rate is reduced to the bare minimum. This is one way of surviving the winter when it is both cold and foodless Aestivation is essentially the same process carried out in summer, particularly when it is hot and dry for long periods. Snails in hot dry countries do this regularly. Some desert snails can survive in suspended animation for more than a year. The authenticated record is 5 years. ",
