            "answer_text": "Hypnotherapy is more accepted and understood by mental health professionals than it used to be. But I\u2019ll stop short of saying that it\u2019s now respected by the mainstream. Hypnotherapy isn\u2019t required study for anyone in the medical or mental health establishment. Few degree programs even offer it an as elective. And the best practitioners sometimes have few or no mainstream credentials. Though I object to the term \u201cpseudoscience\u201d, hypnosis is persistently non-scientific. In a medical system preoccupied with science and credential hierarchy, hypnotherapy will never be widely respected. Accepting hypnotherapy as viable and valid challenges basic, hardened beliefs that many health professionals hold. It\u2019s always going to be easier to dismiss it and keep prescribing meds. ",

            "answer_text": "I tried hypnotherapy for needle phobia, informed by my dentist it would work and work quickly, but like many things you have to believe first what you are told. A questioning academic like myself is the last person perhaps for it to work on and it didn\u2019t. the hypnotist also went into matters that did not concern him. It does seem part of the authority, belief process but in truth most of mental health treatments for example are exactly the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Hypnotherapy is becoming more and more accepted as people let go of past beliefs and recognize statistical facts. People undergo surgery without anaesthetic, lose phobias and fears, reduce anxiety and depression, overcome exam nerves, improve sports performance, quit smoking, improve self esteem, resolve past trauma, lose weight - all with hypnosis. Doctors refer patients to hypnotherapists. There is still a small number of people who haven\u2019t joined the 21st century yet, but that number is shrinking. ",
