            "answer_text": "The mass of one mole of an element (referred to as relative atomic mass)in grams is the same as its mass number which you can see in the periodic table. The mass of n moles of an element = n *relative atomic mass For e.g.: to find mass of 4 moles of carbon you multiple 4 (number of moles)by 6 (molar mass) giving you 24 grams. For compounds: Mass of one mole (referred to as relative molecular mass)is calculated by adding the relative atomic masses of all elements based on the number of moles of each. For e.g. one mole of carbon dioxide CO2 contains 1 mole of carbon and two moles of oxygen So mass of one mole = 12 +(2*16)=44g. In carbon monoxide CO u got one mole of carbon too but only on mole of oxygen So mass of one mole is 12+16=28g. The mass of n moles of a compound = n *relative molecular mass E.g. 3moles of CO2 have a mass of 3*44=132g ",

            "answer_text": "For example, one mole of carbon: The periodic table shows us that the atomic weight of carbon is 12, that is, one mole of carbon has a mass of 12 grams. Being so, if we have one mole of carbon, which is about 6.02 x 10\u00b2\u00b3 atoms of carbon, this has a mass of 12 grams. If we have a compound, like CO2, it is just needed to add accordingly to find the mass of 6.02 x 10\u00b2\u00b3 of such compounds. The weight of a given mass is dependent of the local gravity acceleration. So, here on Earth, one mole of carbon has a mass of 12 grams, and weighs 12 grams-force. ",

            "answer_text": "I am assuming that you want to know the number of moles of a specific compound or element \u201cx\u201d. To find the mass of moles of x (m), you need to know the number of moles of x (n) and the molar mass of x (M). From these values, you need to multiply the number of moles of x (n) by the molar mass of x (M). Briefly, m = n x M ",

If you are referring to the term as in chemistry then you obviously don\u2019t know the meaning of the word. A mole is the substance\u2019s molecular weight in grams. In other words, a mole of water, molecular weight 18, would have a mass of 18g, etc. ",
