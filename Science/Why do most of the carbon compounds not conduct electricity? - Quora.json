            "answer_text": "It is all about the chemical bonds. Let\u2019s say you have a hydro-carbonated compound. That means you have only carbon and hydrogen forming your molecular structure. One example is butane:  Since carbon is in the group 4A of the periodic table, that means it has 4 electrons available to bond to other atoms. As you can see, in Butane, all these electrons are being used up already. Forget our butane molecule for a second, what happens when you apply a voltage across such a material? The electrons in a conductor, that move randomly towards every direction of the material, will slowly start to drift towards the higher potential, and this flow of electrons is what will conduct electricity (they are not all moving in a straight line towards the higher potential, but it is the net drift that matter). (Here we assume that only electrons can conduct electricity, which is not always true, but is enough to explain the question.) We can assume than that a compound with higher amount of electrons, and most importantly in this case, with electrons that are not bounded and can move more easily, will be a much better conductor. Now back to our organic compound, we can see that no electrons are available to flow to the higher potential, because they are all being used to form chemical bonds. That that means that all carbon compounds can\u2019t conduct electricity? Not exactly. This a polyacetilene molecule:  (The hydrogen bonds are omitted to make the picture clearer, but every carbon atom here has 1 hydrogen linked to it.) Notice here, that there is another bond connecting these carbon atoms (called the \u03c0-bond). This bond has the weird property of not beign localized, meaning the electrons used to form it are not fixed, just as an example, between atoms 2\u20133, 3\u20134 and so forth. So when you apply a voltage across such a compound, these electrons can and will be used to conduct electricity. Notice that the current of electrons can only flow in specific directions. If you put a voltage from top to bottom (in the picture\u2019s orientation), no flow will be created. Graphene is a compound that can conduct electricity very well in all directions of the plane it is formed (it cannot conduct in the z-axis, since graphene is a bidimensional material. If you would like some more information, there are several other Quora answers about graphene).  But what about rubber?  This is a cis-polyisoprene molecule, that is one of the molecules contained in some rubbers. Notice it also posses those \u03c0-bonds, but we all know that rubber is an insulating material. The reason is that even though there are some of these bonds in the compound, the carbon atoms in the lower part of the picture (\u2014H2C \u2014 CH2\u2014) cannot receive an extra bond because all its electrons are already forming stable and local chemical bonds, so the delocalized electrons are still trapped in a region of the compound, so they cannot form a flow of electrons.
