            "answer_text": "Well, in youth (think American high schools), students may need some guidance to help them find their career interests, aptitudes, and options. Is college that path? What about trades, military, or straight to work? As a therapist, I can tell you that a lot of MH going on focuses around mood disorders (like depressive and bipolar disorders) and anxiety. But much of that stems from a particular event that may be the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d. That one thing that happened that helped them realize they might need to consider therapy. Many individuals just need a little help peeling back their emotions a bit to understand the world around them. There are common misunderstandings that may be problematic. And responses to them are maladaptive. A common example I use is this. I\u2019ll ask my patients to consider the indicator light on their car\u2019s dashboard that has the shape of a gas pump at a fuel station. This one. \u26fd\ufe0f. I\u2019ll then ask them what that light means (it\u2019s generally yellow). They almost always tell me that it means they need to go to the station and put more gas in the car. When I ask them really, they generally will claim a final answer and ask what else it could possibly mean. This is an example of classical conditioning. Think Pavlov and his famous bell and dog. I reply that it means simply that there is a high probability of running out of gas in less than 20 miles, depending on the size of the tank. It doesn\u2019t mean they need to get more fuel. They have other options. Those include, if it\u2019s a car about to be scrapped or traded, completing the trip to the dealer to trade it in for a new car. Why would they put in 35\u201350 dollars of fuel into a car that will soon be possibly destroyed? Or, if they have a AAA membership, they might be able to call for service to bring them another gallon once they\u2019re out of fuel. Lesser common options, but still options. And more importantly, focus on the message of the indicator. Not what we think it means. ",
