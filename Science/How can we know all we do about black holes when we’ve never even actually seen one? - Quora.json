            "answer_text": "Well, as of last week, we have actually seen one, and it looks pretty much as expected. Prior to that, we made predictions by extrapolating from things that we had seen. We made observations of the world, came up with equations to describe those observations, and then asked \u201cwhat do the equations say should happen in these circumstances that we haven't observed yet?\u201d and went out looking for such circumstances to confirm or refute the theory. Y'know, the scientific method. It turns out that the equations that predict black holes have been extremely well tested in other environments (like, say, programming GPS satellites), so we have fairly high confidence in many of the things they predict about black holes as well.

            "answer_text": "I am sceptical about black hole theory and I believe we should look in a different direction toward developing a total theory , a final one that fills the loopholes of quantum mechanics, black holes and curved space theories: we, the universe and the existence, are nothing but the negation of our negation. Before time and space existed, what existed was their negation. The negation metamorphosed oscillating between existence and non - existence, negation and negation of the negation, until reaching a threshold of density that favored the existence on the non-existence, favored the negation of the negation. As such the universe was born and continued to be born from its negation, the anti matter, oscillating permanently between matter and anti matter until reaching the threshold making the matter and forming piece by piece this infinite universe, continuously and incessantly. The history of the universe is that of an oscillating negation between itself being a negation of the upcoming and its negation, the upcoming, hence the time occurrence . ",
