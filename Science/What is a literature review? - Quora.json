            "answer_text": "A literature review discusses published information in a particular subject area, and sometimes information in a particular subject area within a certain time period. A literature review can be just a simple summary of the sources, but it usually has an organisational pattern and combines both summary and synthesis. A summary is a recap of the important information of the source, but a synthesis is a re-organisation, or a reshuffling, of that information. It might give a new interpretation of old material or combine new with old interpretations. Or it might trace the intellectual progression of the field, including the major debates. And depending on the situation, the literature review may evaluate the sources and advise the reader on the most pertinent or relevant. ",

            "answer_text": "A literature review is a critical review of the existing literature. In-depth analysis of the current literature should be performed and general insight should be obtained. A literature review helps to put the current state of the literature in perspective and ties important advances together from seemingly disparate studies. Often a historical picture and critical breakthroughs are closely examined and remaining challenges are discussed.  Performing a literature review, or reading or listening to someone's literature review, will help one understand where their work lies in their field of study. Understanding the scope of existing literature in ones' research field helps to identify remaining challenges to be addressed, which is good for research progress. ",
