Scold: Seriously, all I had to do was put the word \u201cdeoxyribose\u201d into the search tab for google and it came up with seven immediate responses that said that this is a sugar, that it is a carbohydrate, and much much more. One was a dictionary (these exist on paper too), one was a wikipedia page, one was a biology dictionary, one was a school science learning site, and one was the Encyclopedia Britannica, and that was all in just the first few pages.Why would you ask this here instead of using a search engine?
