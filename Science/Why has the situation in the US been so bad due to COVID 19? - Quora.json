There are two main reasons for this:- The casual approach of The US in the starting, to tackle this Pandemic.Private healthcare system and no universal health coverage in The US.If you look at the FIRST point, intially when the cases started coming in The US, the political leaders there did not pay heed, and with their negligance , they implemented the measures needed, lately. If you look at the SECOND point, this is one the most contentious issue of The US, where healthcare system is very costly, and far away from the reach of ordinary citizens.
