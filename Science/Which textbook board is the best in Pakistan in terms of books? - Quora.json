            "answer_text": "It is considered as an essential element of educative process. Textbooks determine the level of education, level of its teachers and the standard of the system of education. Textbooks translate the objectives of education policy into reality and set the standard of education required for the development and progress of the country. Development of textbooks is an evolutionary process. It continues with the new development and changes in the society and around the world. New information is incorporated in the textbooks, making them useful for the system of education. In such contest, Federal textbooks board is better then others. As they, update the course and books as soon required. There contents are less controversial. But in my opinion, all that use less curriculum shall be evoluted on revolutionary basis, beacuse we are not competing with any other educated nation, atleast with these books. ",

            "answer_text": "Federal Board is said to be the best one. Yet there are issues with almost all of the boards. Yet I found one study that praises the Punjab Board for comparison of science book for class 6 among other boards. There was sever criticism of Sind Board. Yet the committee that supervises the curriculum, initiated a competition among book publishers and boards since 2007. It has offered many new comers in the field like AFAQ. Look at the detailed paper in this respect. http://chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/http://results.pu.edu.pk/images/journal/ier/PDF-FILES/2-Textbook_Evaluation-Amended_14-7-2010.pdf As education is accelerating in Pakistan, so the quality too, yet there are issues of strategy, guidance and so the finances. Government should heavily invest in the book preparation for quality along with consultants and longer term contracts, though local experts should also be given equal chances. None of the boards is ideal yet. ",
