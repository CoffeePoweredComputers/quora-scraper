            "answer_text": "Hypnosis is absolutely real, it is a natural state that we enter into at least twice a day, anytime we start to fall asleep or wake up, anytime we get fully engrossed in a movie to the extent we feel it is happening to us, while driving and we can\u2019t recall our journey around that bend a few miles back or we miss our exit etc. all forms of natural hypnosis at work. There are literally hundreds of ways you can induce someone into a hypnotic trance, I\u2019ve seen it done with objects, various forms of shock, written words on paper, arm raising techniques, and various other techniques, although some are more professional than others, some have better shock or wow value for street and stage work, and some are just similar variations along the same theme. There have been scientific studies, I forget where now, showing the change in the brain during hypnosis. Pretty much everyone can be hypnotized once you know their suggestibility type, are they an E or a P. A trained professional (super easy to learn basic hypnotic inductions, takes time to learn the more professional aspects and therapeutic uses) can use this natural state of hypnosis to bypass your critical factor, accessing your subconscious mind, and getting positive suggestions to go in and be accepted, but only if you are truly open to those positive suggestions in the first place. No one can fully control you with traditional hypnosis alone when you know you're being hypnotized, they may be able to catch you off guard or temporarily get you to do something minor that you don\u2019t care about, such as with stage hypnosis and street hypnosis acts, but they can\u2019t make you give them all your money or go shoot someone, unless that is something you are ok with doing normally in a waking state, or other factors are brought in to play, something you would not see in a professional Hypnotherapy practice. (See Derren Browns experiments all over YouTube, he gets some people to do all kinds of things using other techniques combined with hypnosis). Hypnosis is also excellent at helping people get rid of bad habits like smoking, as long as the person truly wants to quit smoking then they will, many Hypnotherapists have a high success rate with smoking cessation when done correctly. Obviously anyone who truly wishes to continue smoking and has no intention of quitting ever, cannot be made to quit through hypnosis, as they will always make that conscious choice to smoke again, which is why many Hypnotherapists won\u2019t even see a client for a session unless they are coming in of their own free choice, and fully ready to quit smoking, not being coerced to come in by friends, family or their job. So, for anyone to say hypnosis does not exist or isn't real just because they haven't experienced it, would be like saying dreams don't exist just because you don't remember having one when you wake. (I'm sure there must be someone out there who never remembers their dreams). Plenty of evidence exists that hypnosis is real and has been around for a long time. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello! :) The following is my personal opinion and it is not intended to insult anyone in any possible way. I respect everyone\u2019s opinion, but I also protect mine strongly. Ok here it goes - as someone who always tries his best to search for the truth regardless of whether his opinion is going to be popular or not, I am going to kind of go against the grain here and give you a very clear answer - NO. I am really surprised that every single answer so far has been positive despite the lack of real, well established, unambiguous, peer-reviewed scientific evidence. And, as much as I respect everyone\u2019s opinion, I can\u2019t help but get the impression that many people here believe in hypnosis because they want to believe in it and wish it was real, not because they truly believe in it. Correct me if I am wrong, I am not trying to be negative in any way. Proving that hypnosis is a legitimate phenomenon by supposedly making subjects fall asleep by snapping your fingers and then mind controlling them, is something I just can\u2019t even take seriously. Think logically, if somebody\u2019s words and finger snapping could somehow make you fall asleep and make you do things out of your control, don\u2019t you think that people would abuse it all the time? Don\u2019t you think that in your entire lifetime there would be some random situation where certain words are said and they would just happen to affect you and make you suddenly fall asleep? But those things never happen\u2026 I already hear someone shouting - \u201cBut it\u2019s not about some random words and finger snapping, not everybody can say things just like that and hypnotize someone! Only a skilled hypnotist can do that!\u201d - ok, so what exact sequence of words has to be said in order to somehow, miraculously, change one\u2019s brain chemistry so that they start acting like a chicken or a dog without even being aware of it and in what pitch and pace a hypnotist has to pronounce that sequence of words to induce such a miraculous brain chemistry change?I.e. if not everybody can be a hypnotist, then what scientifically proven criteria you need to fulfill to be a hypnotist? We humans use science as the only way to prove the legitimacy of something, hence, if something cannot be scientifically proven, then it can\u2019t be treated as a legitimate phenomenon. Sure, maybe people can\u2019t directly prove that it doesn\u2019t exist either, but as long as people can\u2019t prove its existence, they should not include it in the scientific literature and regard it as a legitimate phenomenon. One is a belief, other is a proven phenomenon. For example sometimes I believe in some greater force (call it God or whatever you want), I really do a lot of times, but that\u2019s a belief, and unless I prove it\u2019s existence somehow I should not expect people to include that in the scientific literature and regard it as a truly legitimate and proven phenomenon, I can only keep that belief for myself. Also, we should never forget that even scientists make mistakes, and that not all scientific studies are truly legitimate, that\u2019s why the best scientific studies are tested many times in many different situations by multiple teams of scientists. All in all, I am kind of disappointed that it\u2019s 2016 and we still have debates about something as baseless and as fraudulent as hypnosis (as defined in the dictionary and as presented in the media). Again, I really didn\u2019t mean to insult anyone, but I will regard hypnosis as such unless someone hypnotizes me successfully, which was never the case so far, or provides me with legitimate scientific information based on legitimate scientific experiments, clear from any taking out of context, ambiguity, result manipulations or media spins. Of course this all is referring to verbally induced hypnosis, I am not questioning the potential existence of a hypnotic state that is induced by drugs or by using some other physically mind-altering things such as TMS and similar. P.S. As for your friends from school making fun of you, I am totally on your side even though I disagree with your belief about hypnosis. I was made fun of many times in school for telling my friends that in Japan at that time robots were playing soccer (and that was obviously really true!) :) Just remember that if they are real friends they will have limits in \u201cmaking fun of you\u201d i.e. they will just joke around about it in a friendly and a playful manner and you should accept those jokes at your own expense and should laugh it all off together. However if they start making heavy fun of you in an unfriendly way, where it becomes like bullying, then you should know that, obviously, they are not your friends and you should just ignore them. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s break this question down first. What is hypnosis? As practiced for the past hundred years or so, it\u2019s a method of getting people to relax and \u201copen up\u201d to whatever it is they might see, hear or sense. Can everyone do that? Of course not, we\u2019re all different, and many of us have a harder time at the \u201cletting go\u201d or \u201copening up\u201d part. Doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t work, or that it couldn\u2019t work, it just might be harder for a person to \u201cgo somewhere.\u201d I had the impression that hypnosis was some kind of form of \u201cknocking a person out\u201d so that they were unconscious. That\u2019s not the case at all - having filmed 45 people under deep hypnosis, having done 5 sessions myself, filming them and transcribing the experience, and examining thousands of hypnosis cases from Dr. Helen Wambach, Michael Newton and Dr. Brian Weiss from their books, hypnosis is a valid tool for a person to explore their subconscious. Doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to get anywhere. Doesn\u2019t mean that what they see or experience is valid, real or actually happened. However, like seeing a film, and then doing research on \u201cwhat really happened\u201d people who do hypnosis can explore avenues and areas that their conscious mind cannot. Hypnosis therapy has about around for thousands of years, the Egyptians had temples for it, and practitioners who put people into \u201cdream like states\u201d to explore the \u201cafterlife.\u201d Stage hypnosis, like a game of \u201cplaying with a person\u2019s ability to follow suggestion\u201d is something that\u2019s very surface and does not resonate. In the case of deep hypnosis, four to six hour sessions that can be repeated over time, a person is able to access things from memory. Where is that memory if it doesn\u2019t exist in the brain? As I\u2019ve reported in \u201cFlipside\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Afterlife\u201d people under deep hypnosis claim to be able to access all kinds of information - not only about previous lifetimes, but the \u201cbetween lives\u201d arena where they claim we choose our next lifetime. They claim that we can access our experience doing so - examine previous lifetimes, examine why we chose those lifetimes, why we chose this lifetime and what they all have in common. It\u2019s not a theory, belief or opinion people do these things - I\u2019ve been filming them do so for ten years. It doesn\u2019t matter what their background, upbringing, religious beliefs (or lack of them) have been - they all pretty much say the same things about the journey. So asking if hypnosis \u201cworks\u201d is a bit like saying \u201cdoes my car work?\u201d Yes, it can work, and there are times that it can\u2019t work. The function of the car is not the issue, it\u2019s \u201chow does a car run?\u201d that is key, and \u201cwhat is needed in order to make my car run?\u201d The person driving the car isn\u2019t the creator of the car, they\u2019re just riding along in the seat and steering the car in a particular direction. In like form, there are good hypnotherapists who have driven the same roads before, and can help guide a person down those roads. But they are the ones who are \u201cseeing\u201d experiencing, \u201chearing\u201d what they experience - the hypnotherapist is not. For example, I was speaking with someone on the BBC radio the other day and after our conversation, we decided to take a little trip - \u201cwhile fully conscious.\u201d He was not \u201cunder hypnosis\u201d nor did I try to \u201cput him under hypnosis.\u201d I asked if he had any vivid memory of any person or event, that seemed other worldly. He recalled a fellow who worked for his father that \u201cappeared\u201d in his mind\u2019s eye a few days before he died. He didn\u2019t know this person well, hadn\u2019t been thinking about him - but he had \u201cappeared\u201d in his mind\u2019s eye and he never could understand why. So I asked him to focus on the memory - to \u201ctake a photo of it.\u201d As he did that, we \u201cwalked up to the person\u201d and asked him some questions. The fellow \u201canswered\u201d the questions much to the surprise of the person I was speaking with. In a few moments we were discussing a previous lifetime they had together, and he gave details about those events,location, etc. Further, we went and visited his \u201cspiritual council\u201d (no other term for it) where his guides and teachers gather to give him advice on his journey. The point is - he wasn\u2019t under hypnosis, I wasn\u2019t telling him what to see. He was seeing these things without my assistance, over a skype phone. One can argue that he was \u201cmaking it all up\u201d but the problem with that notion is that he was saying the EXACT SAME THINGS that thousands of others have said about their council, guide, why he chose that lifetime, etc. No hypnosis required or needed. Did these events occur? I leave it up to him to look up. In my books, I take the time to do as much forensic reserach as I can. Not everyone remembers things the same way - sometimes dates are off, names are skewed, or other details are fuzzy. But then I can\u2019t remember what I had for breakfast yesterday - so the memory of previous lifetimes can often be faulty (as memory often is). But the overall takeaway from these experiences is that hypnosis can\u2019t harm anyone - in some cases it can help people. I filmed one woman with severe Parkinson\u2019s who stopped shaking during the entire session. For six hours she stopped her relentless shaking - only her finger bobbed - and she explored how this illness had come into her life. As she came back \u201cto consciousness\u201d she regained all the shaking and tics. So in this particular case, hypnosis is not only a valid tool of science, it can be a valid tool of medicine. If I had her affliction, I\u2019d spend part of every day doing a hypnosis session to bring it under control. ",

            "answer_text": "It's amazing how many people have told me (very matter of factly!) that there is no such thing as hypnosis. Usually, people say it's not real because it's one of the follow: Some people think it's all acting.Some people say it's placebo.Some people think that a hypnotised subject is just 'trying to please the hypnotist'.I agree that all of these are a factor in many cases, but I also believe that hypnosis is definitely real. Here's why... The first person I ever hypnotised When I was 18, back in 1992, I was crazy about hypnosis. I studied it religiously but I was too scared to try it, and I wasn't even sure if I actually believed it. But I knew enough about hypnotic induction scripts to give it a go. So when my sister's friend Mark saw me reading a book on hypnosis and asked me if I would hypnotise him I decided it was time to find out once and for all if it really was real. I used a basic progressive relaxation induction and Mark seemed to be responding well. To begin I gave him some really simple suggestions. The kind of stuff you might expect to see at a cheesy stage hypnosis show, and he did everything exactly as instructed. Of course, I had no way of knowing if it was really genuine or if he was just playing along. I actually started to feel like a bit of an idiot and expected him to suddenly start laughing at me, but he didn't. Instead, something amazing happened.... Something amazing happened that proved hypnosis is real! I gave Mark the suggestion that he was getting colder and colder. Almost immediately he started to shiver. He was wearing a short sleeved top so I could see his bare arms and within seconds all of the tiny hairs on his arms stood on end and he got goosebumps!  I told Mark it was getting cold and he got Goosebumps!For me this proved that hypnosis is real! WOW!!! I couldn't believe it. You can't fake goosebumps! This was the real deal. Mark was actually having a physical reaction to my suggestion. I was chuffed to bits!!! Then I switched from cold to hot and the tiny hairs all lay back down and the goosebumps vanished immediately. He started breathing heavily and pulling at his top around his neck. His face flushed red and within seconds there were beads of sweat running down his face. That moment was a turning point in my life. It was all the confirmation I needed that hypnosis is indeed real. You simply can't fake such physical reactions no matter how much you want to 'please the hypnotist'. Before that moment I'd been obsessed with hypnosis. I had studied everything I could get my hands on about the subject. I'd even volunteered for stage hypnotic shows to see if the hypnotist whispered secret instructions to me during the induction. But seeing Marks reaction kicked my obsession up to a whole new level. I became a hypnojunky! Within a year of that first induction experience I was doing stage hypnotic shows in pubs and clubs around my local town. I later ventured into hypnotherapy and ran a very successful clinic from my home and over time I refined my skills and started to teach others how to hypnotise. ",

            "answer_text": "Hypnosis is an actual phenomenon. I've never heard of someone being victimized by a hypnotist, but I suppose it could happen. And, law enforcement use of hypnosis is common.Forensic/Investigative HypnosisD. L. Robb, Ph.D.  Hypnosis has been defined as a sustained receptive and intensely focused response to a signal, while diminishing peripheral awareness (Pinizotto, 1989), \u201cfacilitated induction of focused attention\u201d (Gravitz, as cited in Kennedy, 2011, n.p.), and, \u201cas an altered state of consciousness, characterized by heightened compliance with suggestion and extreme focused attention\u201d (Raz & Shapiro, 2002, p. 85). Modern use of hypnosis began with Franz Mesmer in the 18th century, and the next prominent practitioner was Sigmund Freud in 1880, who documented use of clinical hypnosis in Studies in Histeriawith Joseph Breuer. \u201cCommon false theories continue to associate hypnosis with mysticism, loss of autonomy, and mind control\u201d (p. 86). A definition offered by the Society of Psychological Hypnosis of the American Psychological Association, (2014, p. 4) indicates that: \u201cHypnosis is a procedure involving cognitive processes [like imagination] in which a subject is guided by a hypnotist to respond to suggestions for changes in sensations, perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.\u201dBrain imaging studies have shown hypnosis consists of neurophysiological  mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex and in other areas controlling executive attention (Raz & Shapiro). Responsive subjects show brain activation indicating that hypnosis is more than social compliance or role playing with regard to auditory perceptions, visual perceptions, and posthypnotic suggestions.Hypnosis is not universally effective, although even lower levels of hypnotic trance can lead to beneficial results clinically. In the U.S., 10 percent of the population is considered to be non-hypnotizable, with those amenable to hypnosis varying in depth of hypnotic trance between mild and deep (Gafner & Benson, 2003). The best subjects are generally children from age 5, with decreasing susceptibility to hypnosis beyond age 21 (Boulch, n.d.). Positive motivation is essential for optimal results; and, a negative attitude, illness, or post trauma circumstances will generally lead to poor hypnotic outcomes (Raz & Shapiro). Raz and Shapiro also indicated that neuroimaging indicates that the volume and structure of thenerve fibers that carry motor, sensory, and cognitive information between the left and right brain hemispheres can be correlated to attention and inhibitory processing, as well as hypnotizability. Dr. David Eagleman (2011), who directs the Laboratory for Perception and Action and the Initiative on Neuroscience and Law, Baylor College of Medicine has stated that \u201cimplicit memory systems are fundamentally separate from explicit memory systems: even when the second one has lost the data the former one has a lock on it\u201d (p.64). Moreover, implicit associations (subconscious thoughts) are generally not accessible to conscious thought.Forensic hypnosis is primarily concerned with hypermnesia, the ability to recover lost memories (Boulch). The reliability of hypnotically recalled information is directly related to the evidence that the hypnotist has not influenced the person being hypnotized. In spite of the Rock v. Arkansas (1987) decision, in which the Supreme Court held that states may not exclude all testimony of a defendant aided or refreshed by hypnosis, as doing so would be a violation of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, many jurisdictions prohibit testimony on memories obtained during or following hypnosis. And, a few states and some federal circuits deal with hypnosis on a case-by-case basis (Webert, 2003). Where potentially allowed in court, probative (admissible as testimony) or prejudicial determinations are made based on procedural safeguards in place during the hypnotic session, the totality of the circumstances (Martin, 2003).Four potentially negative outcomes from hypnosis have been identified (Webert, 2003; Howell, 2013). First, there is an increased susceptibility to suggestion while hypnotized; and second, there may be a loss of critical judgment and/or desire to please the hypnotist, or the perception that the hypnosis process will provide the proper answer. This can be intentional or unintentional. Third is \u201cconfabulation,\u201d the filling of memory gaps, a concept somewhat analogous to the first outcome, except that confabulation occurs subconsciously within the subject. The fourth is memory hardening, wherein confidence of the hypnotically recalled information is enhanced, possibly in error. These improper outcomes detract from accurate testimony and accurate evaluation of testimony by a jury.Howell (2013) identified ten procedural safeguards the hypnotist must comply with in order to adhere to court admissibility requirements, as dictated by Texas case law as derived from Zani v. State:1.   An acceptable level of training in clinical and forensic hypnosis;2.   Independence from assigned investigators, prosecutors, and defense attorneys;3.   Records indicating case information known prior to the session;4.   Records of written or recorded accounts of case information known by the subject prior to the session;5.   Recordings (video and audio) of all contacts between the hypnotist and the subject;6.   Records of all those present at any time during the session and where conducted;7.   Appropriate induction and memory retrieval techniques;8.   Appropriate application in the type of memory being retrieved;9.   Records of evidence corroborating hypnotically retrieved testimony; and,10. Evidence of presence or absence of suggestive or leading questions, whether overt or subtle.\u201cWith the knowledge of memory and hypnosis that is available, the cautious use of hypnosis may be of great importance to the field of forensic investigation,\u201d according to Pinizotto,  a forensic psychologist formerly with the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Behavioral Science Unit (BSU) (1989, p. 327). This sentiment has been repeated elsewhere (Martin, 2003; Webert, 2003). Hypnotically enhanced memory is assured to be acceptable to the extent that information so obtained can be corroborated, thereby negating the need for testimony at trial (Webert, 2003).Major federal investigative agencies have recognized the potential investigative benefits of hypnosis, and have been consulting since 1979 to develop a \u201cFederal Model\u201d for forensic hypnosis, indicated by Kennedy, a psychologist at the FBI's BSU ( 2011). Recognizing that there is no inherent validity in hypnotically enhanced memory, independent corroboration is necessary. Therefore, careful administrative approval procedures are required in advance (including Attorney General approval for Department of Justice agencies), as are specific interview procedures. The entire hypnotic session is videotaped, and the hypnosis is to be conducted by a mental health professional in the presence the case agent or agency coordinator. The process and potential problems (e.g., abreaction [emotion induced by reliving trauma]) are to be explained to the witness, and informed consent obtained. And, other specifics are detailed in their protocol.  The above elements are consistent with the processes of investigative hypnosis (Reiser, 1980), in that hypnosis merely introduces the element of a \u201csignal from another \u2026, which activates a capacity for a shift of awareness in the subject that permits a more intensive concentration upon a designated goal\u201d (Speigel, 1972, p. 25).As an analogy, the Cognitive Interview (CI) was developed for use with cooperative adults when a crime has been documented (Poole & Lamb, 1998). A deficiency of CI is that it is of little value in cases of false reporting. The CI interview incorporates contextual re-creation, recall of all senses (sight, sound, and smell, etc.), and varied temporal sequencing (first to last and last to first), guided imagery, and repetition. Moreover, Raz and Shapiro (2002) indicated that therapists engage in hypnosis-like activities in common counseling sessions. There is also evidence from brain imaging to indicate similarities between hypnosis, meditation, prayer, and attentive play or study.

            "answer_text": "Hypnosis is like love, in that is real but can be faked. This, I would imagine, would most often occur during stage hypnosis. The Hypnotist would use suggestibility tests to look for a certain type of participant, a somnambulist, but the tests are easy to fake. And let\u2019s be clear, the major objective of stage hypnosis, is, entertainment. In that context, it matters little if it is real of fake, as long as it entertains you; it did what it said on the tin! When it comes to clinical work, one could go in with the intention to fake it but could very well experience a full on hypnotic experience, a consequence of not understanding what hypnosis really is or how it works? You may ask, why would someone pay a Hypnotherapist, with the intention to fake it? One of many answers could be a consequence of control issues, the intention being subconsciously driven? Perhaps the suggestion to try hypnosis was from another person. Some people have an inherent need to prove a point! The professional hypnotherapist is not phased by such mind games as they may know a few themselves, albeit used professionally and in the best interests of the client! When it comes to proving whether it is real or not, that comes from the outcome. For example, a client comes with a fear of flying, which through investigative therapeutic enquiry, turns out not to be the real cause of the fear, and, with no mention of flying, taking off, landing, turbulence, confined space etc. They are cured of the fear; that\u2019s pretty real and based on more than a few clients experience! The same irrational logic apolitically many emotional, mental or psychological conditions. How such a cure/resolution occurs, could be the answer to another question! ",

            "answer_text": "Hypnosis is very real, that's why the government and top companies use it in everyday speech. Media use it, to control the masses, government use it to control in the same way, an example of human behaviour being led, or sheep like, is to blindly believe in scientific evidence, of which most is biased, and carefully planned to ridicule the very thing that is used successfully everyday. If hypnosis didn't work, why is it such a danger to those who don't believe? If you don't believe then it doesn't work in your opinion anyway. For intelligent people who are waking up to all the fraud and lies, hypnosis is very real, and works 100%. Although you'll never get a scientist to agree, as they have a different agenda, good luck to them. Science is not for you, but against you, always will be , because it would interfere with there plans and if people are cured by alternative treatments, there's no need for doctors or scientist's, although science has a lot to offer, as does the medical profession, but truthfulness isn't one of them. Every time I hear someone on here say\u2026\u201d this isn't meant to insult anyone \u201c it makes my skin crawl, it's exactly what you want to do, if it wasn't, why would you say it. Some things are never meant to be explained, rationally, anyway. There are secrets to this universe no one, will ever know, not even science, as much as they try. Looking at hypnosis from a rational viewpoint or scientifically, is already the wrong way to go, because hypnosis doesn't need scientific approval, it works for itself, by itself. Science must be very afraid that this supposedly hocus pocus phenomena is helping people too much. All the answers lay inside you, we as humans do not need science to validity that, we are the most advanced species on earth, yet we have a human error of listing to the hypnotic language and behaviour of those who oppose it for their own ends. Do science, or the medical profession need to advice me I'm wrong? NO, because I have a far more reliable source, my own soul, my own intuition, is far more powerful than either, and it is there to protect me my whole life. HH ",

            "answer_text": "Let us be clear on what hypnosis is and what it is not. Hypnosis is real but it is not at all manipulating brain with an extreme manipulation. What Hypnosis is!Hypnosis is a unique and powerful mental state that is distinct from our  normal waking  and sleep states. The precise definition of hypnosis is a  hotly debated subject, even among hypnotists, though there are some  characteristics that are commonly agreed upon. Two of these  are  narrowed focus and increased suggestibility.  Narrowly focused attention - While in hypnosis it is  easy to simply 'forget' about the outside world. Stray thoughts and  mental chatter are reduced or turned off completely and body awareness  is similarly reduced or forgotten. Subjects retaining a body awareness  usually describe the sensation with descriptions such as very pleasant,  euphoric, tingly,floating, light or heavy. Increased suggestibility - Increased suggestibility  means that suggestions made during hypnosis, either by a hypnotist or  through self-hypnosis, will have a greater impact than if they were made  during normal waking consciousness. This does not mean that any suggestion  made will be mechanically obeyed.  It is widely accepted that in order for hypnotic suggestions to take  hold they must be in agreement with the individual's own moral code.  Furthermore these suggestions should be therapeutically well-formed,  meaning that they are crafted for maximum effect by using language that  is best suited to the subject's own communication style. What Hypnosis is not!There are many common fears and misconceptions  about hypnosis popularized by books and movies, or by having seen or  heard about outlandish behavior induced by a stage hypnotist. The most  common fears are centered around losing control over one's own mind,  revealing private information or being made to take inappropriate  actions. Through the use of drugs and aggressive brainwashing techniques  this may be possible, however it is not at all possible with hypnosis.   All hypnosis is self-hypnosis and it's much more  accurate to think of the hypnotist as a coach or tour guide rather than  as a master and commander. Entering hypnosis is a completely voluntary  process that takes the full cooperation of the subject. People are often  surprised, sometimes even disappointed, after their first hypnosis  session if they were expecting an overpowering or mind-blowing  experience. While these mental states are possible it usually takes a  few sessions for most people to enter deep hypnosis. Being in a state of hypnosis does not in any way circumvent our normal  sense of values. To the contrary, as hypnosis is a state of deep focus  and powerful inner awareness it is much more likely to promote an even  stronger sense of self and adherence to one's personal values. This is  how hypnosis can be so effective in achieving goals such as weight loss  or quitting smoking, by putting us intimately in touch with our core  beliefs and desires. Throughout the day we naturally enter states of hypnosis in various  ways. Also, as we are falling asleep or waking up we briefly pass  through states that are similar to  hypnosis.  In summation, hypnosis is a natural state of mind and a  powerful tool that may help us achieve our goals, it may not be used to  harm or compromise us.  Source: Hypnosis Facts & Myths ",

Quoting: The best and more recent I have access now is this research Study identifies brain areas altered during hypnotic trances. Basically, what they observed is: decrease in activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex;increase in connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the insula;reduced connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the default mode network, which includes the medial prefrontal and the posterior cingulate cortex.These show, in order, that: why people get so absorbed into the trance (and also have many autonomic functions lowered, like heart rate and blood pressure, also relieving pain);why under hypnotic trance people can make much changes through suggestions, as their mind and body are more connected;why people under trance do not reevaluate the suggestions made (of course, considering that it does not touches the belief system or the trance is broken), basically is shows that the critic sense lower defenses.How powerful? As powerful as your imagination can go. In the limits of physics, of course. You can hallucinate, relieve pain, make drastic changes in behavior and beliefs, phobias, addictions, also induce changes into body, such as making the liver producing alcohol by suggestion(one research I remember). And as H. Larry Elman wrote, there are a lot of accomplishments with just hypnosis. ",

            "answer_text": "So far my thinking is that it is real, however the vast majority of things claimed to be hypnosis are nothing of the sort. The most common of these is stage hypnosis. What you are watching is simply a person who carefully selects a compliant person from the audience, (or if they are lazy, the most compliant person from a random group of audience members), and simply ask them to do things on stage. The person, not wanting to embarrass themselves, obligingly follows easy instructions. The next step up from this is Derren Brown, who sells himself as a \u201cpsychological illusionist\u201d, but is just as often using the exact same tricks with an added layer of plausibility (he sells himself on his own scrutiny of stage magic). I once watched a tv show where he claimed to hypnotise every viewer into being unable to leave their chair. He sold the illusion by flashing a picture onscreen of someone tied to a chair, a pseudo-subliminal illusion we were clearly all meant to spot and assume it had some kind of affect. It didn\u2019t, these don\u2019t work in real life. I could get up from the chair fine, and anyone struggling was simply experiencing the same inertia that anyone has whenever they don\u2019t feel like getting up to switch on the light. Then there is one to one hypnosis. I\u2019ve met someone who fully believed they were presently under the influence of hypnosis, and yet it seemed to me that (as with the stage illusionists), the individual was obligingly and willingly following instructions. This is the case with other people who have told me they have been hypnotised. On one hand I\u2019m reluctant to disregard someone\u2019s personal experiences, but on the other, someone who believes in hypnotism and wants to be hypnotised is arguably inviting people to dupe them into further believing it exists. I am currently trying to teach myself how to conduct hypnosis, and I\u2019ve noticed that many of the requirements to conducting a successful hypnotism are also conveniently the requirements that would prove hypnotism isn\u2019t working. For instance, hypnotism (according to my reading) tends to not work on sceptical people but does work on people that already believe in it. Hypnotism also can\u2019t be used to make someone do something they don\u2019t want to do, which again, means there is no adequate way to demonstrate if a person is doing something because of the trance, or because they would do it anyway if you asked them without the trance. I\u2019m sceptical, so hypnosis probably won\u2019t work on me, so the only way I can satisfy my own curiosity is to actually give it an honest go on someone else. I still want hypnosis to be a real thing, and I accept that certain principles, like subconcious and trance states, are a real and scientific part of human psychology - but its the pseudo-mystical/pseudo-scientific aura around the subject that I want to get past to find out the real applications of hypnosis.

            "answer_text": "I was trained in clinical hypnosis in 1983 at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver). Dr. Lee Pulos was one of the main instructors. Lee Pulos, Ph.D.No, hypnosis is not a hoax. But hypnosis exploits the fact that we have two levels of thinking, our conscious thinking and our subconscious thinking. We are all different in terms of susceptibility to be hypnotized. 10 to 15% of people are highly suggestible and get hypnotized rapidly. Another 75% to 80% of people are moderately easy to hypnotize and 10% are resistant to any efforts to be hypnotized.The physician discusses the main problems for which the patient is coming for treatment first. This informs the physician about the symptoms and the setting of the patient. At the same time it establishes a rapport between physician and patient.Next the patient is placed in a comfortable arm chair and the induction phase is started. A common way is to do a progressive relaxation talk where all of the muscles are relaxed from head to toes. At the same time suggestions are given to go for a walk on a beach or a walk in the forest. The imagery is based on what the patient told the physician earlier would be associated with relaxation. This may take 15 to 20 minutes. Towards the end deepening suggestions are given. \u201cYou are going to be deeper and deeper relaxed\u201d. This is repeated in between relaxed setting suggestions. When I was in practice I used clinical hypnosis in suitable situations. I always made a tape recording of the session, so people could be able to listen to it at home for reinforcement.Now the working part of the clinical hypnosis session is reached where the subconscious listens to every word the clinical hypnotist says and the critical part of the mind (the conscious thinking) is largely in the background (hypnotized). This part of the session is centered around what the clinical problem is. It may be phobias, anxieties, fears of failure. Once I had a male patient who was sent by his wife to me, because she wanted a baby, but he could not maintain an erection. He always had all kinds of fears, which interfered with making love. After only one session where I gave ample suggestions that various animals propagate themselves by \u201cjust letting happen what wants to happen\u201d he was cured. This sentence and the associated imagery was the key for him. Within three months of listening to the tape that I had made for him hiss wife was pregnant from him and I treated the child later for ear and throat infections.There needs to be a lot of intuition on the part of the clinical hypnotist (like an inner hearing) when the patient presents at the office and this information is subsequently worked into the working part of the hypnotic session. It is the subconscious mind that internalizes this and the rest is simply that these instructions work themselves up to the conscious thinking. Sometimes this process can take weeks and months. Most of the time 2 or 3 clinical hypnosis sessions are needed. At thee end of a clinical hypnosis session it is important to leave some posthypnotic suggestions, which reinforce what was said under hypnosis before.",

            "answer_text": "Hello! I agree with my colleagues, and in particular Mr. Elman. It is possible to hypnotize someone and, in fact, those of us who are professionals, do it upon their request. We also can hypnotize someone at a party, on the street, in a bar or restaurant - such is the arena of \u201cstreet hypnosis\u201d or on a stage. Hypnosis is a natural state, and while we can facilitate that for another person, there is also self-hypnosis in which a person may bring him or herself into that relaxed physical and focused mental state we somewhat awkwardly have to call hypnosis. You may think of the difference of hypnosis with a hypnotist and self-hypnosis as similar to driving a car or being a passenger. Both ways will get you where you are going, but the experience is somewhat different. There are a lot of different explanations, theories, disagreements about whether hypnosis is a state, a phenomenon, hogwash, whatever. The fact is, it really doesn\u2019t matter. It has been proven that people are able to make changes in behavior, mood, even beliefs through appropriate use of the tools in this basket we call hypnosis. Having personally helped people achieve positive benefits regarding emotional blocks, relationship issues, smoking, sports performance, fear of public speaking, phobias, ADD, test anxiety, weight loss and more, I can tell you hypnosis exists and it can have a dramatic and positive impact for those who take advantage of it. http://dianalaskaris.com ",

That hypnosis isn\u2019t magic, though it is magical as one of my other colleagues puts it. . You will have to be an active participant in the process. We are not mind readers and therefore you need to be honest about anything that is going on no matter how scary it is to talk about it. We can only help you clear your issues if we know what they are. Any hypnotist that you work with will keep your confidentiality and be without judgment. We are here to help you heal. 2. You are responsible for your own results. We can guide you through the use of your subconscious mind, but we can\u2019t make the changes for you . Sometimes, some upsetting events come to light and they need to be dealt with. Other times there are things that you will need to do outside of the sessions, that you must do to make sure that you get the most from the work. Lastly, I always tell people to go online and look at the websites of those they are looking to employ. You can get a feel for the practitioners areas of expertise, learn about what they do and hopefully there will be many testimonials of people who have be helped with similar issues that you have.

            "answer_text": "Hypnosis is a drug free way to help many (but not all) people deal with many different emotional, psychological and physical issues. It can free people from their phobias and addictions, help with self-esteem , relieve pain,and even help kids with learning difficulties and ADHD. Not everyone can be hypnotized, and you can NOT be hypnotized against your will. Hypnosis is NOT Brainwashing- it can NOT force you to do or think anything against your will. It has to be for something YOU personally want to change for yourself. Stage Hypnosis is not the same as clinical hypnosis or Hypnotherapy\u2026The silly things they make people do are done by choosing people who 1st-off volunteer for it, and who react a certain way during the long talk the hypnotist gives prior to starting\u2026 these are the same people who will act very outgoing or even outrageous after too many drinks at the office Christmas party! Hypnosis is NOT a \u201cOne-kind-fits-all\u201d and many of the one-time seminars that help with weight-loss or smoking use negative reinforcement- which CAN have negative side effects in some people. If not done properly, or by a trained professional, hypnosis can have negative or even dangerous side-effects\u2026like falling asleep at the wheel, or vomiting after eating\u2026 You can NOT open a door to other worlds, dimensions or states of reality with hypnosis- nor can you \u201copen yourself up\u201d to possession by spirits or demons\u2026that is just in the movies!! :) <3 ",

            "answer_text": "Alicia: My deepest empathy for your plight. It is difficult for someone to resolve bad memories, because you do not know the intricate process that you require. You are correct, bad memories hold your back, because a lot of your energy and emotional capacity is being used to keep the bad memories at bay as much as possible. No matter how severe or bad your memories you can heal with an effective healing process. First I will clarify the misnomer about hypnosis. Hypnosis is a word used to identify a facilitated trance state. Your mind goes into a natural trance state hundreds of times each day\u2014i.e. the conscious mind going into a trance state. A trance state is merely the conscious mind bringing one\u2019s awareness to a narrow focal point. Automatic trance states are created when one is concentrating; such as, reading, work at hand, driving, watching TV or movie in the movie theater to the exclusion of other issues in the near vicinity. In the U.S. people believe a facilitated trance state (hypnosis) has limited value in deference to a revolving door\u2014counseling, psychotherapy, psychoanalysis and prescription drugs. Albeit, these modalities provide better coping strategies than one can achieve on one\u2019s own the root cause of the issue remains intact and therefore, more coping strategies or prescription drugs are required long-term. Whereas, Europe, South America, Canada, and Asian countries use hypnosis as the most effective modality for Mind and Body healing. Deep Healing addresses the issue at the root cause versus treating symptoms. Deep Healing trance work is a methodical process that goes directly to the person\u2019s innermost issues, providing healing at the emotional, mental, and physical levels, a far different approach than conventional Western medicine, which focuses primarily on response to masking symptoms. Deep Healing avoids prescription drugs, removal of body parts, artificial hypnotic inductions and psychic interventions. Rather the process ties in directly with the experiences and needs of the person. Clinical trance work is the cornerstone of Deep Healing. Deep Healing protocols provide down-to-earth, practical, and amazingly effective outcomes. As a Certified Deep Healing practitioner, I have assisted thousands of people to achieve a permanent solution to emotional and physical diagnoses. A Comparison Study by Dr. Alfred Barrios, published by American Health Magazine reveals the effectiveness of using a trance state (hypnosis) to assist people to heal.  This study clearly points out that Hypnosis is more effective and works more quickly than traditional talk-therapy, counseling, behavioral therapy or psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis: 38% recovery after 600 sessions Behavior Therapy: 72% recovery after 22 sessions Hypnotherapy 93% recovery after 6 sessions Source: American Health Magazine - Barrios, Alfred A. \"Hypnotherapy: A Reappraisal,\" Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice, 1970 I hope this information helps you to make the decision that will be your journey to wellness and wholeness.

Nothing is impossible. Hypnosis does help in Smoking cessation if done well . It may well prove to be the way out of Heroin and Meth Addiction, I want to try this . If it works HELL its a step forward for many to come . Pain control I do not have freezing for Root canals or Extractions. it shocks my dentist to see me smile not frown during an extraction.

There is another article with the Stroop Effect.  Nature Reviews Neuroscience To summarise it for you.  The Stroop Effect is an experiment when a word is flashed at you and you have to say the color of the word.   It's useful because it's difficult to not read the word, and when they are flashed at you quickly you get tied up in knots.  The control group failed miserably as expected.  The highly hypnotizables (who were to temporarily forget language) basically reacted on instinct of the color, and the brain scans did not show the reading centers lighting up. I hope this helps.

As with all things human, not everyone is susceptible to the same degree however, it's a reasonable assumption that most people can be hypnotised. Indeed, Freud argued that everyone could - it is simply that it takes longer to induce in some people. At the other extreme there are those known as deep trance subjects - these people are much loved by stage hypnotists Hypnosis represents a state of deep relaxation. The conscious mind is bypassed and there is direct access to the unconscious (or subconscious as some prefer).  In our awakened state brain waves are at Beta level,  at mid-range that's about 22 cycles per second although the cps can go lower or higher depending on the nature of activity. Hypnosis typically occurs at Alpha level - that's about 8-15 cps. It induces a thoughtful, reflective state and is susceptible to suggestion. Perhaps the best evidence your doubting friends can have is to recognise that they, like us all, daydream from time to time. Daydreaming is a manifestation of hypnosis - the mind is not attending to what's going on around us. Any student that's sat in a long lecture has experienced a wandering mind. ",

Maybe you are looking out a window to the snow covered ground as you are listening to your parents talk to you. Or maybe in a classroom where you are staring at the blackboard and listening to the teacher. Youre zoned out but still aware. During this period of relaxation, you are half asleep or half awake. During that time your mind is more able to listen to suggestions. Hypnosis is simply giving someone the positive suggestions during your subconscious state of awareness to help with a whole host of issues. If youbare truly interested id recommended a book called hypnosis for beginners by william hewitt. Everyone approaches hypnosis or believes it or doesnt believe it in their own way. In my opinion, if you say it isnt real, then someone making suggestions through a tv commercial that makes 0 sense yet people buy the product cant be real either. ",

And I think the real issue here is not whether hypnosis is real or not but that you think you need to defend yourself and your interests against your friends. I know (from experience as we all do) that we want the acknowledgement from our peers and our social standing is very important in a young age. Yet I want you to ask yourself \u201cwhat is it that \u2018I\u2019 want?\u201d. If your friends have their fixed opinion that hypnosis is a scam there isn\u2019t much you can do to change that. And some people will never learn. Hollywood has helped to paint a false picture of what hypnosis is and what not. Is it really _that_ important that your friends don\u2019t think your interest is \u2018fake\u2019 or a \u2018scam\u2019? Hypnosis is one of the best researched methods and something each one of us has experienced and does experience on a daily basis. It shouldn\u2019t concern you what your friends think about your interest in that topic. Trust me, I\u2019ve been there. And over time a lot of them will spark their own interest and come back to you for advice if you only stand strong and with your interest. Regardless of what others say or think. I spared you more knowledge about the general idea of hypnosis since all the other answers already provided lots of details about that. :) ",

            "answer_text": "  Yes, it is very real and it is very effective. It works like this: the hypnotherapist can introduce positive suggestions into the subconscious mind of a person under hypnosis with the intention of curbing certain destructive behaviors, helping that person to overcome irrational and/or debilitating fears, reversing or deminishing the underlying causes of behavioral and psychological issues such as PTSD, Anxiety, OCD, Insomnia, and many other common ailments. It can be used to help a person lose weight or to quit smoking. A person cannot be hypnotized without their willing participation. It is not something a hypnotherapist can just \u201cspring\u201d on you, and usually takes multiple sessions, including general therapy and goal setting that will allow for an outlined plan to be designed with the purpose of targeting the patients key issues or ailments. A hypnotherapist uses commands to assist the patient into a subconscious state of mind. I have attached the explanation of the brains states of consciousness and the accompanying brain waves. Hope this helped! ",

But therapeutic hypnosis done by a licenced and trained hypnotherapist is different. You might want to try it out and see. I have exchanged sessions with some of my colleagues who do hypnotherapy, just to investigate. No real purpose intended. One friend hypnotized me four times I think. He told me to forget the number between 7&9, and then to count from 1-10. I followed his instructions and skipped 8, but I didn't forget it, I was just doing what he said to do. After the session I told him that I had just been playing along, and I mentioned that I have a crazy good memory for numbers so that might not have been a good test for me personally. The strange thing was that after that session, I realized I knew all the numbers on all the cards in my wallet. Like 16 digit ones. And about ten of them. (I had had maybe my SI number and DL number memorized previously, but now I knew my care card, all my credit cards, etc)   ",

            "answer_text": "I've been a hypnotist since 1974, covering all different aspects of hypnosis, I was privileged to have met Milton Erikson during our lifetimes. I notice there are very varied answers in this thread; with some steering away from Hypnosis and border lining religion? Hypnosis simply means \u201cRelaxation of the Body and Mind Combined\u201d If you split your brain into two parts 12% being the conscious (analytical part) and 88% the subconscious / Unconscious part. The Analytical front part of the brain is like a guard that only allows information past and into the subconscious part; that it believes and deems fitting; based upon peers and built-in belief systems (i.e. religious convictions, family values etc\u2026) The subconscious is like a mini universe that is expanding with daily life experiences being stored within its vast storage system and as more books are read, videos watched, lessons learnt, emotions felt, people met, conversations had are all stored within this amazing subconscious infinite hard drive. It all has to be filed into its own zip file within; for retrieval when required. It regulates body heat, It keeps your heart beating and regulates your breathing, It heals wounds, it sends white blood cells to ward off viral attacks to protect the body. If you are in a crowded room and someone shouts your name, the subconscious reads to vibrational signals given from the ears and turns it into coordinates to allow you to turn your head to where the sound is coming from. If your Conscious brain had to do all of these things at the same time\u2026 as soon as you heard your name being called, you would forget to breathe and keep the inner ear fluid balanced along with keeping your legs straight etc\u2026 and you would simply fall to the floor possibly dead because you forgot to regulate the heart and blood pressure. The conscious part of the brain can only hold so much information at any one time which is why people who try to remember too much; get anxious and find it hard to sleep at night for fear of forgetting. (quick tip - Write things down so that it frees the conscious and you will sleep like a log) I equate each day as a bubble\u2026 when we wake up we start a new bubble and within each daily bubble is every single blink that you made during that day, every heartbeat every emotion, every hot/cold spell, every person you met and spoke to too! the conversations that you had, the feelings you had pertaining to situations, the emotions triggered etc all stored inside the daily bubble. When you go to bed that bubble gets pushed further down and a new daily events bubble starts\u2026 As the days weeks and years go by, you have accumulated lots of daily bubbles that get pushed further and further down into the subconscious brain, going very deep down into the subconscious; getting pressed smaller (much like a bubble being pushed down deeper into the sea, it will shrink smaller) Now somewhere within these daily bubbles of emotional information are fears/phobias that can be triggered off for what appears to be no reason in your grown-up logical mind\u2026 but! Something; is triggering off anxiety attacks? a phobia etc\u2026 so it must be inside one of these daily life bubbles. So anyway we come to the Is Hypnosis Fake? question. That depends upon how one views what it means to them as an individual. How many times have you sat there and gone into a Daydream and then suddenly snapped back into consciousness and looked around slightly confused? You do that sort of BIG BLINK think before snapping out of the daydream and someone near you says \u201cAre you listening to me, I've been talking to you!\u201d to which you reply! \u201csorry I was miles away\u201d that is a form of trance. Or\u2026 Driving to a regular place daily\u2026 when one day you get to the destination and ponder\u2026 Not remembering driving past certain locations?? not remembering changing gears or stopping at red lights\u2026 (you know you must have done, but! done remember) these are trance states where your conscious has sneaked off for a nap, knowing your subconscious is taking care of business! So YES\u2026 Hypnosis is very real in The real sense of the word and meaning. It simply means putting the conscious part to sleep and speaking directly to the literal part of the brain, The part that cannot analyze and believes all that it is told (hence we need the conscious to filter out truths and untruths etc and only let in the good stuff) Example\u2026 I was a stage hypnotist for over 15 years in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s and performed a few suggestion tricks to filter out good subjects for my stage show, the people whose hands actually did stick together when I told them they could not open them etc\u2026 I would get the volunteers onto the stage for the next part; which is to make the conscious so bored that it falls asleep and leaves the subconscious wide open for my suggestion input. Now as an example, If my volunteers were in their normal awake state and I said you are a chicken. Their conscious part of the brain will TELL the subconscious \u201cNO WE ARE NOT\u201d AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS WILL BELIEVE WHAT IT IS TOLD (BECAUSE IT CANNOT ANALYZE) But!\u2026 after doing the suggestion susceptibility tests and putting their Conscious part to sleep, I have now effectively become Their Conscious and so now; the subconscious will only do what I tell it to do without question and without a doubt! Example: I'm offering them an onion and telling them it is a nice juicy apple. Their subconscious has tasted enough juicy things, to be able to believe it is simply a juicy apple. etc\u2026 But! There is a drawback to Stage hypnosis and that is, If I input too much without taking away the previous suggestion, then gradually they stack up and the conscious will snap back and take over, Thus waking up your volunteer. although still confused but now wide awake. My speciality field is Clinical hypnotherapy, able to help people for all sorts of ailments. I could go on but! I'll be writing a book lol\u2026 speaking of a book .. I have written a book and made a DVD both on Amazon. with kind regard from John ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is that it depends on the hypnotist. There are magic resources (like tricks and illusions) that say hypnosis is total bunk, that it's done with confederates, or a number of parlor tricks. Such books then go on to list a good handful of \"tricks\" which are things you can get people to do actually outside of the hypnotic state anyhow but are quite impressive, as well as list a number of ways that one can enlist confederates from the audience. However, yes, there are also numerous more resources that address genuine stage hypnosis where the subjects do actually go under -- behaving in very curious ways, regressing in behavior and memory, to exhibiting feats of impressive talent that even they were unaware they had or could still perform. This is also evident through lingering post-hypnotic suggestions that can still be triggered long after the show, without the subjects realizing why they're doing so. The two can have a little overlap in appearance, but the first is usually side-show theatrics in appearance, while the other is more engaging and in-depth. ",

There is nothing fake about a young woman who stops fainting at the sight of a hypodermic needle, or a teenage boy who stops stuttering, or an insomniac who can finally sleep after struggling with the problem for decades, or the alleviation of chronic visual disturbances from HPPD, or even the ability to walk properly again and without a cane when the problem is psychosomatic.

            "answer_text": "Yes hypnotism is entirely possible.  What is hypnotism?  It's defined many different ways. Some people define it as a mental state, as you seem to.  A \"trance\" if you will.  The point is to focus, distract, confuse, or bore the conscious critical mind, so you can get past the critical mind to the sub-conscious and effect deep level belief systems. Sub-conscious is a factual part of the mind.  You know when you somebody asks you a question and you \"pull a blank\"?  And then minutes, hours, or even days later, all of a sudden it pops into your head? Your sub-conscious didn't stop searching through your mind for the answer, even though you weren't aware of it. All of your experiences and memories and past decisions are stored in your sub-conscious, and define who you are, what you do, and how successful you are. Via hypnotherapy, or skilled self-hypnosis, you can rewrite that somewhat in a more positive way.  It's especially effective at stopping or starting habits, but there are MANY ways to use it. Trance as a state of mind, is something you probably experience every day.  You know when you drive, get to your destination, but don't remember the drive?  You were in a trance state.  You know how you read a good book, watch a good movie, or play a good video game, and completely lose track of your surroundings and feel disoriented when you stop?  Trance state. Hypnotherapy is simply using that trance state in a positive way to effect change in belief systems. Hypnosis Training College - Hypnotherapy Certification - Hypnosis Motivation Institute  has a fantastic free foundation course in hypnotherapy, great books etc if you are curious. I also love their model for self-hypnosis.  10 bucks, and it really can change your life, if you use it.Self Hypnosis Made Easy - MP3 Download ",

Stage hypnosis and street hypnosis are used to entertain an audience. Not only that, but many peer-reviewed academic journals are devoted to experimental hypnosis, or the experimental study of hypnosis. The Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, American Journal of Clinical Hypnosis, Australian Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis, and Sleep and Hypnosis are examples of journals which publish scholarly articles on hypnosis-related research studies. From these, it is clear that many Ph.D.\u2019s in fields such as psychology and neurobiology take it quite seriously. If you want evidence that the hypnotic state exists, just scan some of these journals for studies which incorporate EEG (electroencephalography), which is used to gauge state of consciousness. What they will commonly say is that the power along the alpha and theta bands (which are frequency ranges of the EEG signal) is relatively higher in a state of hypnosis than in a normal state. ",

Hypnosis with therapy, facilitated by an experienced and effective hypnotherapist, and with a committed client, has every chance of dealing with distress and worry, as well as any maladaptive behaviours issuing from them (i.e. bad habits). Hypnosis on its own isn\u2019t therapy. It is a means of inducing a spectrum of mind states. those mind states make certain types of therapeutic interventions very powerful indeed. ",

            "answer_text": "Hypnosis can work for some things with some people. It's an outstanding antidote for stress and anxiety for almost anybody. As to resolving trauma from the past, I strongly recommend a psychologist or psychiatrist first. Memories are usually repressed because we can't handle them. If yours are breaking through and causing intolerable anxiety you don't need help recovering them, you need a skilled guide to help integrate them into your consciousness. That's the role of a psychotherapist. A hypnotist can certainly lead you into an altered state where most people are more open to suggestion. But suggestions that paper over what your mind is trying to surface for you would be counter productive. You will be much better off consciously accepting these memories and viewing them in a way that is not so threatening. I've read quite a number of books on hypnosis from pop self help to scholarly research. I've practiced it and used self hypnosis on myself. I've been hypnotized by licensed hypnotherapists for things like diet, quitting smoking and even improving my golf game. I've even attended workshops on and studied Neuro linguistic programming. Hypnotism isn't a magical fix. It's fascinating but results vary from one individual to the next. You need a therapist trained to help you deal with the content breaking through from your subconscious. That's not what hypnotherapist study. ",

Basically, the trance state is a totally normal phenomenon, which we all experience many times each day, without either being aware of it, nor capable nor interested to put a name to it.  - Every time that we drift off; while in a conversation, doing the dishes, driving, listening to a boring lecture, we find ourselves in a dissociated state. We are here and not here at the same time; we are still in contact with all the stimuli of the outside, real world, but yet, in that moment, our inner, private world becomes more interesting and attractive, so our attention shifts there. The hypnotic 'induction', is just an artificial means to help someone connect to their inner lives, leaving the contact with the outer, less important.  It is thanks to this privileged moment of linking to ourselves, that certain things can be changed or activated or released or put correctly into place,  which makes this experience so useful ",

Hypnosis: Inside the science that could change your mind This article shows that there's not only real evidence of mental and emotional changes, but physical as well. The affects of hypnosis (and there's more than one kind), has had such a dramatic affect on patients that many hospitals now incorporate the practice and encourage it. Hypnosis and its affects can sometimes take one session, or may take weeks to even months (it depends on the circumstances being dealt with as well as the individual). It is like any other therapy (such as psychotherapy), it can take time for it to ingrain upon the subconscious and then have an affect. Unfortunately, many people give up too soon, and then say it doesn't work. They usually don't realize that it can take time as any other therapies can. There may also be a different style of hypnosis that needs to be applied depending on the individual's needs and unique personality (there's classical hypnotherapy, Ericksonian, etc.). See link here for the various types: Types of Hypnotherapy - Hypnotherapy Directory If you want to sign up for a free course on one of these styles of hypnosis (by a renowned Ericksonian hypnotherapist from the U.K, Dan Jones), you can sign up on Udemy for that course here and decide for yourself: Learn Hypnosis In An Hour ",

When a hypnotist works with a client, she spends enough sessions just talking so she can learn more about the client and the client can feel comfortable and relaxed. The hypnotist slowly induces a deep state of relaxation verbally. When the client is deeply relaxed, the hypnotist can use different suggestions to bring about change in the clients thinking and behavior. It\u2019s not some magic done on stage, one time in front of an audience. Hypnosis to reach a goal can take several sessions of hard work and letting go. The client can return to full wakefullness whenever he wants. There is no loss of control. I find being hypnotized to be very relaxing, pleasant, and helpful. ",

            "answer_text": " YES, Hypnosis is real! You couldn't function in life without it. Let me explain further below\u2026 HYPNOSIS is the word used to describe the connection with your unconscious mind. When you go into hypnosis, you go into a very suggestible and dreamy like state, very similar to a daydream. This is a very powerful state for learning and problem-solving as well as experiencing a heightened state of relaxation. Every morning as soon as you wake up when you are half awake and half asleep still, that is hypnosis. It is also referred to as the THETA STATE. Theta is measured by the waves per HZ your brain is operating at. The theta level is when your brain is between 3HZ-8HZ. When you are inside this theta brain wave state, you will be relaxed and extremely focused. We naturally go into these states as they are designed to help us solve problems and increase intuition. At the theta level the conscious mind hands control over your subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is controlling 95% of your unconscious responses, such as your heartbeat, hormone production etc. And it is also reinforcing your current beliefs, and making sure you are safe. When the body goes into shock, fascination, fear, or any state of heightened emotions, that's when the subconscious takes over. When you are cooking, you are in cooking hypnosis. When you are driving a car, you are in driving hypnosis. Any kind of fixated trance, or focused state you go into, is going into hypnosis. I hope this makes sense\u2026. If you have any further questions about this, please contact me. ",

I am curious that you focused on the quantity of bad memories instead of the strength of them. I suspect that the problem is your incapacity of accepting your failures. Before you do something so radical like hypnosis, try psychotherapy. Go to a shrink, or something similar, and tell him/her your stories. Actually it doesn\u2019t even have to be a professional, but it has to be someone who listens, and doesn\u2019t fill your mind with more ideas. The important part is to get them out. the only reasonable alternative is to write all of those stories in a computer or a piece of paper. Just get them out. Good Luck. ",

After my high school graduation, we all went to a place to have fun like spending time in the arcade, playing air hockey, and riding go karts and etc at this \u201cplayhouse\u201d kind of thing. Later that night there was a hypnotist event where he picked me and several of my peers to be hypnotized. I volunteered because I don\u2019t believe that this is a real thing and I wanted to see for myself. And several minutes later\u2026nothing happened. Note that I wasn\u2019t trying to resist getting hypnotized or anything and was just relaxing in my seat, but nothing happened. I just felt a little tired because the guy made me close my eyes and was talking about some nice warm beach. Eventually he told me and another guy to return to our seat while he proceeded with the other kids and they put up one heck of a show. I don\u2019t really know if they were actually hypnotized or if they were just going a long with it and trying to be funny since the people that were in the seat were known to be kind of funny and comedic back in school. So based off of my experience, my answer\u2026is no. ",

Suggestion is used to reducephysical pain and to  helpeliminate undesirable behaviors. A therapist must use caution thatsuggestion not cause false memories. Before pain reduction therapy on some areas of the body, an MDshould evaluate the patient toavoid trauma caused by preexisting injury that iscausing the pain.

There are several theories as to what hypnosis is, and what constitutes a hypnotic state. What most of these theories share is hypnosis is a state of increased suggestability. Which may or may not include relaxation.  How I define hypnosis, is it is the bypass of the critical factor, with the establishment of acceptable selective thinking. Another factor is not all people can be hypnotized by all hypnotists. The hypnotic state is generally dependant on the rapport between the subject and the operator. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes its absolutely real. To understand hypnosis you needto understand why and huw it works. Basically it relies on rendering people vulnerable and giving them suggestions to follow. This can be done by interrupting a conditioned pattern reflex like \u201cshaking of hand\u201d and closing their eyes and saying \u201cclose your eyes and sleep, relaxing deeper and deeper as you listen to my voice now sinking deeper and deeper\u201d The subject getting shocked and confused will accept the suggestion of \u201csleep\u201d and continue to follow along. Although some people are more suggestible than others hence the need of suggestibility tests before hypnosis, it has been found out that its not the words that cause a person to be hypnotized, its the belief that he will get hypnotized by the hypnotist. Its basically an expectation which is made reality by themselves as they want to experience it. So if its a skeptic its very important say to let go of any scepticism before trying these methods. In the end if done correctly everyone can be hypnotized. Its all in your skills as a hypnotist to make them feel something is going to happen. And after the initial induction its all about post hypnotic suggestions. ",

This is called subliminal suggestion and done by either placing a suggestion just beneath a song or other sound or it can be done visually by flashing a quick picture of something on the screen of what you are watching or just a image in the back ground. This plants a seed to your subconscious mind. A hypnotic suggestion usually lasts about a month but aspects can stay with a person from the experience they had as a result. Mostly people will not do anything against their morals such as murder, but it one tells his subject that the person has committed an unforgivable act that fits their moral values they may act on that. For example if you tell the subject he rapes and kills young children. I do not recommend hypnosis as you are surrendering you will to another. Rarely a wise position and like drugs can open a door to demons. ",

From Wikipedia: \u201cthe effects of stage hypnosis are probably due to a combination of psychological factors, participant selection, suggestibility, physical manipulation, stagecraft, and trickery.The desire to be the centre of attention, having an excuse to violate their own fear suppressors, and the pressure to please are thought to convince subjects to \"play along\u201dfrom a military study aiming at verifying whether hypnosis could be used for military purposes: \u201cIt would be difficult to find an area of scientific interest more beset by divided professional opinion and contradictory experimental evidence... No one can say whether hypnosis is a qualitatively unique state with some physiological and conditioned response components or only a form of suggestion induced by high motivation and a positive relationship between hypnotist and subject.\u201dhypnotherapy is regarded as a type of alternative medicine by the NHS and other reputable medical sources.Summary: stage hypnosis seems to be completely fakeis hypnosis an altered state of consciousness? This is controversial. My take: probably not.On the other hand suggestion can be strong. It seems it can alleviate pain (similar to placebo effect) and somebody used it to cause hypnotic blindness without hypnosis (T.X. Barber but could not verify).Maybe a better question is: how strong is suggestion? ",

Firstly I do not believe that there is a distinct hypnotic state and secondly that hypnosis is not something that is done to you.  So putting someone into trance for me does not describe hypnosis accurately I do believe that anyone can learn to take themselves into hypnosis and the role of the hypnotist of hypnotherapist is to teach the subject how to engage their imagination and belief and have a correct expectation of the experience. It has been shown that the effects of hypnosis, such as positive response to suggestion, can be achieved without trance  or reference to an unconscious mind inferring that both these concepts are not needed  We are always suggestable and our behaviours, feelings and thoughts are driven by our beliefs. In hypnosis our focus and imagination enhances that suggestibility and produces results that cannot be explained solely as placebo. ",

When a hypnotherapist puts you in a trance it is just deeper than that mini trance and they want to keep you in that trance long enough to deal with whatever issue you have at the time. Talk to friends, colleagues or family and ask for their experiences, whether you believe it or not is up to you. Cheers ",

This supposedly \u2018scientific\u2019 theory was abandoned when no evidence was forthcoming. In modern psychology two main theories have long competed to explain the extraordinary effects hypnosis can have. State theorists claim that hypnotic suggestions induce an altered state of consciousness or hypnotic trance in which highly suggestible people are willing to obey the hypnotist and behave in uncharacteristic ways, such as remembering forgotten events, forgetting what they have just done and obeying post-hypnotic suggestions to perform some embarrassing action when given a cue. Non-state theorists claim that all these effects are better explained by role playing and suggestibility. So there is plenty of scientific research but no agreement as to the best explanation. ",

Some similar moods are choice, some are just responses, hypnosis is always induced by someone else, otherwise it isn\u2019t Hypnosis. Hypnosis occurs in fact so yes, it is real.

A professional and experienced therapist can help the person make substantial life changes by adjusting the way the person thinks then feels. The thousands of people who have Quit Smoking in one session, those who have ceased biting nails, recovered from a needle, flight or other phobias almost instantly, plus so many who have reduced their trauma and bad habitual habits through hypnotherapy is astounding. The ability to research, accept and understand the complexity of the human mind and subconscious is complicated.

But I have often found that the most initially sceptical people often make the best hypnotic subjects - almost as if a part of them sensed they would be talented subjects, so the conscious mind built up prejudice as far as hypnosis goes. A person can not believe in a car, but still travel in one; their belief (or lack of) is irrelevant because the car\u2026works. Fortunately, there is so much evidence for the efficacy of hypnosis carried out scientifically that I don't need to try to convince people; I only need to help them use hypnosis.

Not only can a person hypnotize another person, you can be brought into these deeper levels by doing things like listening to music, watching TV or driving on a highway. It's really simple. We actually spend much, if not most, of our lives in these deeper states. In hypnosis we just take advantage of the altered state and direct the subject to things like past lives, current life memories, self healing or changing habits. ",

Whilst almost anything is possible in theory, in practice it may not be worth the effort.  Whilst I imagine certain hypnotic techniques could be used to distract/confuse to make stealing something easier I think there are easier physical misdirection techniques that are much more common. Doing anything under hypnosis that is actively against someone's convictions/ ethics is extremely hard without resorting to very long induction processes which might start to border on abuse and look more like brain-washing.

This association facilitates pain reduction. The issue might be hypnotizabilty. There are some individuals who are simply not hypnotizable and would therefore not benefit from hypnosis. ",

Without knowing the cause, all we can do is treat the symptoms. One you know self-hypnosis, you could start by envisioning yourself speaking slowly and clearly. Notice how that feels. If you stammer worse some times that others, notice how it feels to speak more clearly, and notice what the differences in you thoughts, feelings and the sensations in your body. Explore these sensations. Don't be surprised if emotions come up, let them.  You can throw in some positive suggestions, if you want (\"I see myself speaking slowly and clearly.\"). If you find you have some resistance or reaction to those suggestions, follow up with those feelings and see where they take you. It will take time, so have patience. Good luck. ",

There are many levels to hypnosis. Esdaile state of hypnosis for example has been used in India in the 1800s, its the deespest state and was used instead of anesthesia.
