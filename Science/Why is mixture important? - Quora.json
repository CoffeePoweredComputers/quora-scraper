Mixtures are used in many processes, including steel manufacturing, the chemical industry and many others. ",

            "answer_text": "A mixture is a mechanical combination of several elements or compounds. Mixtures are used in cooking, chemical manufacturing, and a lot of other processes. A good mixture with the materials evenly distributed facilitates a good after mixture process. That might be a chemical reaction or a great cake. One mixture that we see the results of a lot is the mixture of water, gravel, and Portland cement that, after a good mix, becomes concrete. Other mixtures might include the various plastics and epoxies that require two or more parts to become a finished product. There are so many possible mixtures out there I\u2019d suggest chemical engineering books , chemistry books in general, cook books, books on construction processes, and many other possible sources of mixtures and the results of using them.
