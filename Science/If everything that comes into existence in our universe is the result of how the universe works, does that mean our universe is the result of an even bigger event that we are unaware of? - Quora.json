            "answer_text": "If everything that comes into existence in our universe is the result of how the universe works, does that mean our universe is the result of an even bigger event that we are unaware of? It is a logical possibility but not an unavoidable conclusion. Deductions we make from observations of things coming into existence inthe space-time that makes up our universe, are not necessarily valid when thinking about the coming into existence of that space-time itself. Aristotle made this mistake of extending deductions beyond the range where they are valid, in his theory of gravity. He deduced there is something in the nature of heavy objects that causes them to move towards the center of the universe (which was in his times located at the center of the earth). His theory fitted the earthbound observations of the time.We now know that on the surface of the earth heavy objects fall towards the center of the earth, but not elsewhere in the universe. This does not mean that it is always false to extend the range of our conclusions beyond the range of our observations but we can not be certain. ",

            "answer_text": "We used to think that higher complexity can't arise from lower complexity and that there has to be creator who is far more complex then we are. After discovery of evolution and natural selection it became clear that that's not the case, and that higher complexity can be created by pure chance from lower complexity. My point is that we don't have enough data to claim something like this. ",
