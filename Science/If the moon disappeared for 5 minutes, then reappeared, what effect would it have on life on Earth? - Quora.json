            "answer_text": "Q: If the moon disappeared for 5 minutes, then reappeared, what effect would it have on life on Earth? If the moon were magically to vanish, its gravity would vanish along with it. That means that a second and a half later, Earth\u2019s lunar tidal bulges would begin to collapse \u2014 both the bulges in our crust and in the oceans. The biggest effect would be on the oceans, where high and low tides all around the world would suddenly rush back toward equilibrium under only the influence of the sun\u2019s pull. In a few places, this would cause a rushing tide large enough to founder small boats and to endanger swimmers. In a few, it might cause dangerous tsunami waves, though you would have to model the event of a supercomputer to be sure. In most areas, it would hardly be noticeable. Since about 10% of the tidal effect is on Earth\u2019s crust and mantle, the sudden loss of force would likely trigger earthquakes, though I doubt any would be detectable without scientific instruments. After all, we are only talking about the tidal change normally extant over twelve hours suddenly being released all at once. That would certainly cause compression waves through the mantle, but not very strong ones, I should think.  Then, whatever happened would be reversed five minutes larger when the tidal bulges returned. Aside from that gravity, it would be as if the moon had been obscured by clouds for a few minutes. Nature would carry on. Conspiracultists around the world would have something new to blather about. Scientists would wonder how such a thing could happen, and their investigations, if fruitful, might yield interesting and dangerous produce.

            "answer_text": "Okay so in essence what you're asking me is what would happen if the moon. The thing that is mostly responsible for the high and low tides on earth, was to disappear and reappear some time later. Ok let\u2019s say this first. I\u2019m by no means a scientist and so this is all conjecture on my part. 1-The moon disappears. 2-About .02 seconds later the gravitational force on the earth\u2019s water also disappears. 3-Five minutes later the moon reappears. 4\u20130.02 seconds later the gravitational force on the earth\u2019s water also reappears. 5-The sudden reappearance causes apocalyptic floods killing millions of people. It\u2019s also possible that it could throw us into deep space. In that case we all die. ",
