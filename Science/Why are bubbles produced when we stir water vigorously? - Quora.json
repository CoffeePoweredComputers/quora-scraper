            "answer_text": "Water under pressure has a lot of air dissolved in it, especially cold water. When we fill a pan with water the pressure drops to atmospheric pressure. Disturb the water, by stirring it, and air comes out of solution with the water and forms bubbles. If the water is also being heated, raising its temperature, it can hold even less air in solution, so that also causes air to come out of solution and form bubbles. ",

            "answer_text": "Because you're disturbing the surface which makes air descend into the depressions on the waters surface. And when water then covers the made depression the air is now trapped inside the water as bubbles and then floats up. All this happens very quickly. ",
