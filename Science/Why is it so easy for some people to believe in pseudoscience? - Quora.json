            "answer_text": "Someday you wake up and realize wearing your lucky Spaceman Spiff underwear isn't enough to guarantee a good day. But, what can you do? People hold faith in or accept as fact what seems to support their present comfort, whether we're talking about homeostasis or social standing, for so long as it seems plausible enough or necessary to do so.  For some, it's a choice; for most, it's training; and for many, they've just never considered another way.  It's only when uncomfortable and confronted with some sense of implausibility or unreliability in their personal schema for reality (and the belief that they won't be burned at the stake for defying the gods or contradicting the natural order) that they get curious enough to question. However, as often as not or more so, people don't wake up one day with newfound objective capacities for dispassionately examining evidence or even a clearer understanding of the question. So, they just think what they've learned to think, do what they've always done, and hope for better results in the new day. After all, the world is great, the sky endless, the gods' ways mysterious, and any apparent cruelty is probably because of our lack of faith or to chasten our tolerance for our wicked neighbor's godless ways. In troubled times, one still hopes to wear the most comfortable underwear one can find.  In a crisis, we go back to the last thing that seemed plausible and supportive for hope and moral strength in distress. That's part of the human emotional architecture. Sorry. You've probably heard that there are no atheists in foxholes, and it certainly can be challenging to keep a level head when deranged lunatics suddenly appear, trying to take your head off while shouting their plan to be intolerant of your wicked, godless ways - whatever that's supposed to mean. You might've thought you were there to aid them with the mystery behind their failing crops, but concern can go right out the window when fanatics and zealots with weapons show up. Two points of advise for dealing with situations like these: Be careful how you tell local tribesmen that bodies they've buried in their fields have enriched the soil - though not because any sacrificial value to their gods. They might take away the wrong message.Don't be too quick to declare yourself high priest of whichever deity you promised obedience in exchange for surviving the last battle. It's... Well, it's just possible you didn't survive as a result of the divine intervention of Horus (or any gods named since). Have you heard of Stockholm Syndrome?",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure whether this is an answer. But, homeopathy is actually true. Basically, the cells in the body is moving as a wave along the so-called body. (Body is actually just a compound concept like a House. Eg, there is no House except the combination of floor and walls and ceilings and etc) So, the cells forming as the body is moving as a wave. And along the time, even in a second, they are dying and re-borning. Basically \"sick\" is a form of more dying amd less re-borning. Human body has the ability to reborn the died cells. But, the causaility of dying cells are severe, and the natural reborn process is not able to compasate, the human body got into stage where it cannot function anymore. (Called death). Acient people help accelerate the natural cell reborn process by showing the body into sunlight. (Which is scientically proven) And don't confuse with the \"scientifically proven fact\" and \"commonly accepted fact\". Science is still the growth. It cannot explain everything. But, beause science is not able to explain (or not tried enough / not worth to try) , it doesn't mean the something is wrong. ;-) Edit : Then, it is even easier. You don't want why pseudo science is being crediable. And rather, you just want to know why people believe in pseudo science ?  My observation is, people believe in Result (solution) of their problem (often, without going through the \"Solving\" process). If you can show the result OR you can convince them result is certain OR they have no other more viable option for the result, they will believe your \"process, in this case, pseudo science\" of the result. And also, it will up to the psyche nature of the person. Reasonability or knowledge. And the nature (pressure upon that person) of the circumstance. Eg, my son is being bitten by the tiger and I am 20 miles out from nearest village, i might let a person who said he can cure the wound just by reciting some words to cure my son. In my opinion, there is no pseudo science. There is only approaches that works. And approaches that doesn't work. And the approaches that have been proven and the approaches that have not yet. ",
