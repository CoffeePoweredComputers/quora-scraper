            "answer_text": "Well, technically one could call it that, but doing so would reflect an overly simple view of the term, carbohydrate. Wikipedia has, as usual, a good discussion of this. To provide an excerpt: \u201cFormerly the name \"carbohydrate\" was used in chemistry for any compound with the formula Cm(H2O)n. Following this definition, some chemists considered formaldehyde (CH2O) to be the simplest carbohydrate,[11] while others claimed that title for glycolaldehyde. [12] Today, the term is generally understood in the biochemistry sense, which excludes compounds with only one or two carbons and includes many biological carbohydrates which deviate from this formula. For example, while the above representative formulas would seem to capture the commonly known carbohydrates, ubiquitous and abundant carbohydrates often deviate from this. For example, carbohydrates often display chemical groups such as: N-acetyl (e.g. chitin), sulphate (e.g. glycosaminoglycans), carboxylic acid (e.g. sialic acid) and deoxy modifications (e.g. fucose and sialic acid).\u201d (Carbohydrate - Wikipedia).
