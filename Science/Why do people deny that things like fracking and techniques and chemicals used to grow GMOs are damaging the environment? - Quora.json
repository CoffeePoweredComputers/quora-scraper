            "answer_text": "Everything that humans do, including so-called \"green\" technologies, alters the ecology of the earth.  Humans have been modifying the genomes of food species for 10,000 years. The question of modern GMO harmfulness usually boils down to \"glyphosate ready\" crops, and the safety of, and the question of over use of glyphosate, which are important environmental issues. GMO food is indistinguishable, in terms of nutrition, safety, and all other respects, from non-GMO crops, which is the driving force between the GMO labeling movement. The fear of so-called \"Frankenfood\" is an hysterical reaction fueled by disinformation. Hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling has been tremendously successful method of oil and gas production with several hundred thousand wells. It has been long known that fluid injection can stimulate faults to produce earthquakes. The vast majority of earthquakes caused by modern oil industry methods have been generated by deep wastewater injection wells,rather than hydraulic fracturing. There have been issues of cementing failure, and surface spillage resulting in some ground water contamination, but the fracking process has yet to be shown as contributing to ground water contamination, as the formations that are fracked are at great depth, far below the water table.  Again by creating a climate of hysteria, the anti fracking movement attempts to amplify problems, and demand a ban rather than reasonable regulations. The economic success of these technologies make banning unlikely. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer your question directly, I can only guess because I haven't encountered any studies that would clarify the reasons for denial--or for support of these measures for that matter. I suspect that the majority of people are in a big category that includes those who are unaware of problems, overwhelmed by the problems they've heard about or uninterested. There's always another fraction of people who are effectively in denial because they believe that solutions will be found 'eventually'. There's a fairly small minority (I hope) that stands to gain from the practices that you mention. Then there is a fairly large group of people that are more or less obliged to participate in some of these scourges. For these people I think that the psychological factor of Cognitive dissonance might be at play. When it's stressful to harbour the realisation that life is forcing a person to do things that the person's conscience is not at all happy with that individual will often invent excuses of one kind or another. Denial could be one of them. ",
