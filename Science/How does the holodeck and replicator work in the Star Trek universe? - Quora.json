            "answer_text": "The technology is actually described in quite a bit of detail throughout the different series, but to sum it up the images are created by resequenced photons and force fields. The photons are organized into three dimensional images based on the program that was input into the computer system. That is just the beginning however because being photons there is no mass and therefore there can be no physical interaction, that's where the force fields come into play. The fields are used to create barriers allowing you to touch and interact with the things the computer creates. With regards to replicators, they use basic organic gel to create different foods and liquids and basic inorganic compounds to create objects such as plates, bowls, boxes, clothing etcetera. Now something these technologies share is the resequencing process, for example using the basic organic matter to create protein which is then resequenced into meat and cooked. Some of the answers here would have you believe that this is completely impossible, I would say they couldn't be more wrong. We have already proven that the basics of this can already be done with our current level of technology using cultured proteins and a 3d printer. The experiment consisted of using the 3d printer to gather and rearrange the proteins into the shape of a hamburger which was then cooked to medium rare and eaten by the lead scientist. This is just another in a long line of examples of star trek technology being the inspiration for some truly innovative and stunning technological advancements. Just remember to keep an open mind when it comes to what is possible and not possible, especially when out comes to sources of inspiration, star trek is unique in that it is inspired by reality and also inspires reality. I hope this was helpful, if you have any other questions please feel free to ask. ",

            "answer_text": "They both work using similar technology. That technology being matter manipulation. In a holodeck the closest explanation I ever heard to something that was doable was that in that enclosed room, photons are being actively manipulated and given more mass, in order to produce a sort of virtual matter. That V-matter only sustains it's properties while the field that regulates it is active once it's shut down photons return to their normal state. I got to say that I don't entirely agree with this explanation. Given that Holodecks would only be good for one person. Any larger number of people inside the Holodeck would need to stay in close proximity. Imagine for example a beach being simulated in a Holodeck. You got two people in it. You say you're gonna catch some sun while the other person says he/she is going for a run on the beach. Because of this scenario then the Holodeck can't compensate for the two people in it, seeing it can't create space. In order to create space then it wouldn't be the manipulation of photons or another type of matter, but rather the previous creation of a pocket dimension that's pre-established and contain in each room and that pocket dimension in turn could be manipulated to work as a kind of teserract. Or in other words you'd be able to create rooms that contain more space in them then the entire length of the ship. A replicator is much more simpler. All food, or liqued, or object is a made of matter. Seeing they can teleport people and objects then it stands to reason they can also dematerialize matter, store it as energy is special containers, and then when you ask for something to be made on the replicator, as long as it has the subatomic blueprint of whatever it's you desire, it can take that energy and convert back into matter. In a manner of fact it would be the ideal way to make Antimatter and explain how ships can stay years in space without needing to mine for very specific fuel or resources. Imagine that they're traveling and need resources. All they would need to do would be to locate a asteroid field or some other object made of matter. They would beam in the necessary mass, thus obtaining the necessary energy, for them to make basically everything. From fuel to parts, to basically anything they required. As for how something like that would work. Well. That obviously goes beyond even nanotechnology. It's more quantum technology. Seeing you need more than just rearrange atoms, you need to build something from the ground up. Meaning that you need to build something from quarks, to subatomic particles, to atoms, to molecules, to whatever you needed. ",
