            "answer_text": "There is no plausible version of this scenario in which only men exist. Women are capable of producing eggs which possess an entire genome. This is basically cloning and would rigidly segment society while also increasing the risk of the entire species getting wiped out by plague. If men suddenly evaporate and all women become capable of asexual reproduction, castes would rapidly develop in which Marshas would lord over Jans. Carry nepotism on to its logical conclusion and you see where that will lead.  Then, because of a lack of diversity in future generations, entire bloodlines would get wiped out by minor plagues. Without sexual reproduction genetic diversity would ensure the species cannot sustainably grow. Eventually a bird flu or pneumonic plague or modified herpes strain would finish off the species.  \u201cI mean if humans were one gender psychologically but would reproduce asexually, how would the world be different?\u201d -OP \u201cOne gender psychologically\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense. Gender isn\u2019t psychological. It is chemical & physical. Gender is defined very shortly after conception, resulting in different protein and chemical cocktails in utero. Those different cocktails cause tissues to grow at different rates and determine the physical neurology - the construction of the brain. Sometimes, in about 10% of the population, the brain is physically similar to the opposite gender. This is typically the case for homosexuals. I\u2019m not sure about the 1% of the population who are transgender (research is light as of the time of this writing), but I presume it is similar. Our biological gender typically determines the physical construction of our brains, which determine a good chunk of personality & traits, and thereby cannot be extricated. Brains (thereby psychology) cannot exist without a gender-based blueprint. There is no such thing as a psychological gender, just neurological, which is physical. Mismatches are pretty common, but it\u2019s still a spectrum between two default states. \u201cThere\u2019s more to gender than the physical/sexual dude. Transgender people feel like the other gender, psychologically. Men, psychologically, are more strong and aggressive, women are more emotional etc\u2026 But then again those have to do with hormones. But there are other features, I think relating to brain. Actually, I don\u2019t know all that much about this other.\u201d -OP You\u2019re being pretty reductive. Men are not all stronger or more aggressive, nor are all women more emotional. To assert any deviation from stereotype is trans is pretty damn hypocritical. Some hetero men transition to women, some gay women transition to men, some people (Miley Cyrus for example) are \u201cgenderless.\u201d There are entire communities of people who associate with races and species they are not born into. There are a lot of variables involved. As far as I can tell there has not yet been any concrete results of any studies into any of the transitional states people ascribe to. Are Miley Cyrus, Caitlyn Jenner, and your neighbor\u2019s Furry \u201ckin\u201d similar in any way? Or are they all experiencing slightly different versions of the exact same stimulus? We don\u2019t know yet. Until we do, it is reasonable to assert the standard spectrum with two default states is the norm. To that end, your question has a flawed premise. ",

            "answer_text": "We would probably get wiped out by diseases. As Patrick Wiley says, asexual reproduction leads to very low genetic diversity, and a genetically homogeneous population is very vulnerable to disease. That is why farmers must fight so hard to keep their crops free of diseases. Let us assume we survive the onslaught of diseases and soldier on. It is conceivable that we would evolve to be more altruistic and less tribal. Parthenogenesis is effectively cloning, so sisters, first cousins, second and third cousins would all be virtually genetically identical. This means that, from a genetic point-of-view, helping your third cousin\u2019s children survive is just as good as helping your own children survive. In fact, we might evolve a kind of eusociality - with \u201ccastes\u201d specialized for different kinds of work, some specialized for breeding and others not breeding at all. Eusociality has evolved several times among insects in the order Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps), and I have heard this is believed to be because Hymenopterans reproduce in a peculiar way that makes sisters particularly closely related.
