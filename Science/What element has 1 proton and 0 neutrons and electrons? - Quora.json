            "answer_text": "That can only be the ion of the most common hydrogen isotope, H-1, or the protium ion. Deuterium, H-2, another stable hydrogen isotope, has one proton and one neutron in the nucleus. Tritium, H-3, is radioactive (unstable) and has one proton and two neutrons in the nucleus. In any case, the ions of these hydrogen isotopes are all designated as H+, but their individual atomic weights are different. ",
