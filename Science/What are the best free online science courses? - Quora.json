And thanks to the Internet, there are now a whole bunch of classes you can take from the comfort of your couch. But there are a lot of time-wasters out there, which is why we've done the legwork for you and collected nine online science courses from top universities like Harvard, MIT, and UC Berkeley. They're life-changing, and they just so happen to be free through online learning hub edX. Check them out and make sure that next time you spend a couple of hours procrastinating online, you're actually learning something at the same time. 1. Super-Earths and Life What you'll learn: Are we ever going to find life outside Earth? This course will teach you everything you need to know about the search for alien life, including where to look, how it might have started, and how we'll find it if it's out there. 2. Quantum Mechanics for Everyone What you'll learn: This four-week long MOOC (massive open online course) is perfect for everyone who's fascinated by quantum mechanics. There's no complicated mathematics required so it's perfect for all enthusiasts, but quantum theory is taught without \"dumbing down\" any of the material. One of the most fascinating ways you can spend your Christmas break. 3. Scientific Methods and Research What you'll learn: This might be one of the most important subjects to study in a post-fact world. The course teaches you the ins and outs of the scientific method, how to tell good science from dodgy research, and how to analyse and talk about science articles. 4. Science & Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science (part 1) Commitment required: 5-7 hours a week What you'll learn: We all want to be better cooks, but it's hard to know where to begin. Top chefs and Harvard researchers have teamed up for this course, using principles from science and engineering to help you create culinary delights in your own kitchen. 5. Introduction to Computer Science What you'll learn: OK so it's not strictly science, but programming is the must-know language of the future. This is the ultimate introductory computing course and perfect for people with no programming experience. It'll teach you languages including C, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, CSS, and HTML. 6. Climate Change: The Science What you'll learn: Win every argument with climate deniers from now on.

The Extremes of Life: Microbes and Their Diversity What you'll learn: Life on Earth is so much stranger than we ever imagined - in some of the most extreme parts of the planet, researchers have found creatures that eat nothing but air and survive ridiculous amounts of radiation. Find out more about the incredible microorganisms that exist on Earth and why they're so important to our future. 9. Cell Biology: Mitochondria What you'll learn: Mitochondrias are the power houses of the cell! These incredible organelles play a crucial role in our energy production and overall health, and scientists are finally beginning to understand more about where they came from and how they work. Perfect for all the biology lovers out there. 10. The Science of Everyday Thinking What you'll learn: How to think better, argue better, and choose better, thanks to science. Find out the psychology behind why we think the things we do, and how our opinions, expectations and judgements form. It's the one course that's guaranteed to directly impact your life and make your life a whole lot better. 11.
