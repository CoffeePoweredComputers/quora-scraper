            "answer_text": "Subtle question! Here is a thing: the Melting point of any pure substance is defined as a temperature at which said substance turns into a liquid (more strictly, this must happen when the atmospheric pressure equals the substance\u2019s Vapor pressure). The keyword in the above definition is Chemical substance, that is, a compound whose composition remains constant. When this is true, there can be only one temperature value that can be termed as the melting point of that substance.  Now, the \u201csad\u201d news: Butter is no pure substance. It is rather a mixture of two otherwise immiscible liquids (i.e. an Emulsion), water and oil, that are held together by proteins (which act as the so-called emulsifier). An emulsion like that has no definite melting point, because the presence of many substances does not allow a unique value. Indeed, if you consider each substance as the \u201cpure\u201d one in the butter emulsion, you will see that the other ones act as impurities and thus lower and broaden the pure substance\u2019s melting point. In general, you can describe a softening range or a melting point range for substances like butter: in this case, the width of such a range depends upon the composition of butter (% of fats, carbs, etc.) but can be safely taken, for most of butter recipes, as between 30 and 40\u00baC.  Got hungry now. Gotta go get me a butter sandwich.  ",
