            "answer_text": "Yes, Social Sciences are Real Sciences. Let\u2019s start by defining social science. Usually this is an umbrella term for all scientific fields that deal with human systems. These include Economics, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, Management, Marketing, Finance, Political Science, the list goes on\u2026 There is a famous clip of Richard Feynman, the brilliant American physicist, where he describes social sciences as pseudoscience. It goes to show that even remarkably intelligent people can really get it wrong sometimes.  Now I do conceed that his criticism is partially a valid one. Indeed, many, if not most, social science researchers until the mid 20th Century cared very little for empirical evidence. This was no longer true in the beginning of the 70s when this interview was recorded, but decades earlier, most social science was done either by writing long self-ethnographies about the author\u2019s perception of how the world works, or incredibly dense mathematical deduction from basic axioms which were many times untested. This led to the rise of many theories that were simply wrong, or out of touch with reality. But still, some of these theories did later prove to be good representations of reality, by withstanding the burden of empirical proof. Since then the social sciences as a whole have become much more similar to the natural sciences. You construct a theory, and then you collect data to support your theory. And ultimately both your theory and your data should be quantitative in nature. All of the fields that I\u2019ve mentioned up there as being social sciences have formal mathematical expressions to describe many of its phenomena. Don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s see some examples: Anthropology - One of the most important areas of anthropology is the study of kinship systems. For many decades, mathematical group theory has been applied to this field to describe the formation of kinship terminologies across cultures. Here\u2019s an example from a 2010 research paper about the Dravidian kinship systems published on the Journal of Mathematical Anthropology and Culture Theory: It striked me as a good example of mathematical language going deep into the description of a cultural systems. And the most amazing part is that this kinship theory is not simply a mathematical artifact detached from reality, it is very efficient in predicting the kinship terminologies across cultures and languages. There\u2019s a software called Kinship Algebra Expert System (KAES) based on this theory which has a accuracy close to 100%. Sociology - For many decades sociology has been a very quantitative and empirical field. In particular social network analysis is one of its greatest achievements. Graph analysis as discrete mathematics tools already existed prior to its application in sociology. But sociology gave a strong contribution to find real world applications of it. Noawadays social network data is widely available and many of the theories developed in sociology are now being applied across a variety of fields, especially the node centrality measures which were initially developed for sociological problems (social influence and reference group theory). Wikipedia has a very good article about it. (Source: By Screenshot taken by User:DarwinPeacock - Screenshot of free software GUESS, CC BY 3.0, File:Sna large.png) Psychology - Our brains are physical systems. And indeed, some of the earliest mathematical and quantiative theories in psychology came from the field of psychophysics, which studies how our nervous systems process incoming physical stimuli such as sound, light, temperature, etc\u2026 And this led to the discovery of Weber\u2013Fechner law. (Source: Weber's Law of Just Noticeable Difference) This is an empirically validated mathematical expression that attempts (very successfully) to describe the relationship between stimuli and perception. Economics - We all know that mathematical deduction forms an important part of economics theory. What you may not know is that Lie Group Theory has found applications along a wide variety of its areas including growth economics. It appears that R&D processes and consumer taste changes can be effectively modelled by Lie Group Transformations (and this model has been empirically validated as well). Also in the field of behavioral economics, we have the famous example of Prospect Theory, which is a beautiful and elegant extension of classic utility theories to the realm of experimental lab science (also integrating insights from Weber-Fechner Law), showing that our decisions change according to the framing of our prospects (in terms of being gains or losses). More recently Lie Group theory has also found applications in Prospect Theory. It goes to show that social sciences can combine the mathematical sophistication of Physics with experimental and rigorous empirical testing of its models.Marketing - For many decades the Bass Diffusion Model has been employed as a silver bullet in new product sales forescasting. It is a differential equation that is widely used in Marketing departments to predict sales of products. It appears that diffusion of innovations in markets always follows this pattern. Another widely used model is the NBD-Dirichlet model, which is a stochastic model of the Double Jeopardy Law. Brands with higer market shares tend to to have higher customer loyalty as well, and this regularity is captured by the NBD-Dirichlet. These two models form the basis of the modern day Marketing Engineering.Finance - The most celebrated scientific achievement of the Financial science is the Black-Scholes model, which is a partial differential equation that describes the price of an option over time. It was inspired by the study of stochastic processes in Physics, in particular Brownian motion. It is the cornerstone of Financial Engineering.Management - As an academic discipline management science is sometimes referred to as operations research, and it has an established history of getting things right since WW2. Most of its initial focus was supply chain, logistics and military action. Modern day management science also extends its modeling capabilities to human factors, which of course incorporates knowledge from organizational behavior, human resources management, psychology and sociology. Computational and statistical models that combine the study of human and non-human factors are now beginning to enter common usage.Overall there seems to be a perception that social systems are not possible to describe using the same tools of the natural sciences and that social sciences are not \u201creal\u201d science. This is of course not true. In fact, with neuroscience and biology being increasingly used to explain behaviors and attitudes we could say that the distinction between these two worlds is fading fast. If we think about it every social system will utimately be a physical system. All of our perceptions, beliefs, emotions, memories and ideas occur in our heads (by which I mean our brains). Our brains are biological, chemical and electrical systems, which are ultimately physical systems made up of subatomic particles. Our behaviors and attitudes all originate from our brains as a reponse to our external environment (which as you may guess is also a physical system, or systems of systems). Therefore, by studying our social systems we are studying a part of the universe which also has patterns capable of being measured and described by mathematics. Qualitative and interpretive methods will still have a place though, especially when it comes to coming up with new research hypothesis. In fact quantitative approaches to this humanistic side of social science are also emerging with Quantitative Semiotics and Quantitative Ethnography as notable examples. ",

            "answer_text": "Some people who call themselves social scientists are real scientists, but many are not.  Up until the middle of the 20th century, most clearly were not.  Since then, gradually and very painfully, the situation has improved. To be specific, classically trained economists are not scientists, just people playing elaborate games with equations in a fantasy universe.  They begin with assumptions that everyone knows are false, and then construct ever fancier mathematical \"proofs\" of how people and economies would behave if those assumptions were true.  The fact that even their most sophisticated models rarely correspond with reality has never invalidated a single one of their \"proofs.\"  That's not science, it's a form of academic masturbation. Until very recently, sociology was almost as bad.  You could get drummed out of the profession if you insisted that human organizations, institutions, and societies were, in any sense, real.  Imagine that!  A field claiming to be a science that denies the existence of what it studies!  One in which calling someone a \"realist\" was a nasty professional insult!  During most of that period, the best that could be said for many sociologists was that they were honest pollsters and data analysts.  Unfortunately, quite a few weren't even that. Psychology was split for quite a long time between a small band of experimental scientists and a huge tribe of practitioners who were little more than modern witch doctors, and who insisted that studying the brain had nothing to teach us about the mind.  Modern neuroscience has shifted that balance quite a bit, and the effort to actually evaluate different kinds therapy and find out what works best has finally gotten some traction after having been stonewalled for over a century. From what I know of it, anthropology, which is supposedly the most observational and journalistic social science, actually has a better record than most of the others.  Over the last century anthropologists have observed many cultures and human situations and have reported reasonably honestly, on the average, without outrageous amounts of theoretical or ideological bias.  They've had their share of bitter theory wars, but at least they haven't let any one extremely theoretical abstract structure dictate outcomes for the whole profession. Overall, it is fair to ask several questions of a supposed science:   How much predictive and explanatory power does it have?How well do its models correspond with reality?How honestly does it deal with phenomena it cannot yet explain? If the answers are \"little, poorly, and not at all,\" it isn't a science.  If you want an example, look at education research in the US.  The research literature is filled with anecdotal accounts dressed up in the language of science, with a sauce of bogus and frequently intentionally deceptive statistics; less than 5% of the papers accepted by refereed journals would meet the standards of any real scientific field; and almost none of the studies, even those with the most dramatic claims, are replicable and have been replicated in anything like a rigorous way.  As a result education in the US swings perpetually from fad to counterfad to neofad, accomplishing nothing but the enrichment of the consultants and other charlatans leading each \"movement.\" ",
