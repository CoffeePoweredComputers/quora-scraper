For MANY years (until the late 1970\u2019s) there were only Professional journals that cost a lot of money but individuals and most technical libraries bought them. It was Free to publish, but your paper went through Rigorous review process and verification. Then it was published. Capitalism being what it is, there then came a bunch of almost professional journals, that allow people to Pay to publish their paper, with little review. However, the journal is low cost and Many people get it, so there is wide dissemination. Finally, the WWW (internet) came along, and anyone can have a Blog or do what ever they want. Therefore, there are Plenty of sites that will \u201cPublish\u201d your paper. However that does Not mean that your paper is even worth the \u201cpaper\u201d it is not printed on\u2026\u2026 So, you can be Published, but today that is Meaningless, unless you are Published in one of those first set of Professional journals with a Rigorous review and verification process. Those journals still exist and that is the only Worthwhile place to publish. NOTE: College admissions officers know that, and they roll-their-eyes when they see that a high school student \u201cpublished\u201d some papers. Sorry. ",

I also remember writing in my judging of a high schooler in a science fair that I would be happy to help her submit her project to a journal. IMO, her work was good enough for publication. (It was not going to win, because the poster wasn\u2019t \u201cartsy\u201d enough, but the experimental design, data collection, and data were of a quality to be published.) In science, what ultimately matters is the data. Personal characteristics about the author are irrelevant. It does help to have published scientists as co-authors, since those scientists are more experienced in the writing style and requirements for data presentation. However, every journal has an \u201cInstructions to Authors\u201d section, and a high schooler can follow those instructions as well as a member of the NAS can. The editor may require more detailed information about data collection and to see the raw data than might be required of an established scientist. It depends on what the subject matter and the data are. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. If the paper represents a scientific contribution to its field. No one is going to ban you from publishing because of your age or educational status. Two prerequisites, though: 1) The editor will likely make inquiries into the data and data collection procedures to assure that everything is in order and sufficiently sound (particularly if no ordinary research institution is listed under affiliations). 2) You'd have to be quite a talented and diligent high schooler to pull of concieving, planning, executing and reporting a study well enough for it to pass through peer-review. This point cannot be stressed enough. Simply getting an overview of what has been done and attempted in a particular sub field can take years and usually requires interaction with one or several advisors with a career within the particular field. Good luck. ",

It is unusual for a high school student to do a research project that is novel and important enough for publication in a good journal, and it is unusual for such a student to know how to write a publishable paper; these are things you learn in graduate school. However, there is no rule against it, and, especially with the help of an experienced teacher or collaborator, it might be done. Of course there are journals, blogs, etc. that will publish anything for you for a fee, online or even in print, or you can start your own blog and put anything you want in it. If what you are writing is really impressive, people such as admissions officers may take an interest in it, but they will not view it as a \u201cpublication.\u201d ",
