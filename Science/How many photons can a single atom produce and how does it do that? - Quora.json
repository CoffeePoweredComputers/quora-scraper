            "answer_text": "There is no single correct answer. However, in general an atom has no limit to the amount of photons it can emit. Each photon corresponds to a single transition between two atomic energy levels. That's a reversible process. If you shine a light on a single atom that is resonant with an atomic transition, you get resonant Rayleigh scattering along with absorption and reemission. The resonant Rayleigh process is coherent with the incoming light and corresponds to the atom acting as an optical antenna, which scatters the incoming radiation. If the atom actually absorbs an incoming photon, it usually just reradiates the energy as spontaneous emission. Either way, that atom remains intact and the process continues. Simple linear processes such as resonant Rayleigh scattering can be sustained perpetually. There is no limit to the number of scattered photons. However, there is usually a very small probability for a nonlinear interaction that could result in the atom being ionised. This probability can be made arbitrary small by keeping the incident power low. The ability of atoms and ions to perpetually emit photons when optically probed is used in may quantum optical systems, often as a means of determining the quantum state of the atom or ion. For example, this procedure is used to read out the final state of an ion trap quantum computer. ",

            "answer_text": "An atom \u201cproduces\u201d no photons by itself. Only when an atom has received some extra energy from outside it emits (sooner or later) away the extra energy in the form of photons. So at the end you stay where you started. Technically the extra energy elevates the electrons to a higher orbit and when the energy is emitted the electrons return to their \u201cnormal\u201d orbits (as happens in any laser). ",
