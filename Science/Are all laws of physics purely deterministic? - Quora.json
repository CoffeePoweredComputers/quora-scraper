            "answer_text": "Classical mechanics is fully deterministic. I don't think anyone would argue against that.  This question really only became relevant with the dawn of quantum mechanics (at least from a physics point of view). Quantum mechanics is interesting, as you said the time evolution of the wavefunction is fully deterministic, but a lot of people consider quantum mechanics to be more probabilistic (but this will depend on your 'interpretation').   The wavefunction is pretty useful and all - it knows everything there is to know about our system - but it doesn't just tell us what we want to know. We have to 'operate' on it in order to get real values that correspond to physical properties.  This process is where probability enters.  The results of the 'operations'  look very much like what you would expect if you are familiar with statistics.  As a result, it is generally taught that these operators provide the probability of an event happening or of measuring a particular outcome.   There are other ways people try to interpret these results (many worlds, hidden variables ... etc.).  Personally, the statistical interpretation never bothered me and I found it the easiest way to think about problems when you're solving them. However, nobody really knows.  Proponents of hidden variable theories have been taking blows from tests of Bell's inequalities for many years, but some of them don't seem to mind. Each interpretation has it's own, 'well that's weird', thing about it. ",

Once we make our measurement, the concept of undeterminism or probabilism collapse. So i think, as long as we do not find the ways to make measurements\uff08get informations\uff09about the quantity we are interested in, physics remains undeterministic. But once we construct the \u201cscale that suits\u201d, undeterminism becomes obsolete. ",

            "answer_text": "How can physics be deterministic? Physics or science is by definition studying mass and energy perceptible to senses. As per Sanskrit bhootha or bhoutha. Bhootha means ghost or devil. That means these all before something , now became this thing, visible to senses. Since physical form is uncertain, then it\u2019s study is also uncertain. He remains same but body becomes child, teen, adult and old age. Changing stuff. Hence physics or physical is ghost reading or study of bhoothas. ",
