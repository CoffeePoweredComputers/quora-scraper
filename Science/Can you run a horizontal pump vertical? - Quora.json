            "answer_text": "What is commonly referred to as an end-suction pump can be run vertically and, in fact, is a very common process pump. However, because the mounting surface of a pump\u2014called the pedestal\u2014is so important to keep the pump rigid and aligned with the motor, you cannot simply turn an end suction pump vertical and expect good results. The pump has to be designed to work in a vertical configuration. A horizontal split case pump\u2014between bearings pump\u2014cannot run vertically. These pumps are balanced designs in which the impeller thrust is cancelled by the configuration of the impeller(s). Here are the various commonly used end suction (overhung) pumps:  ",

            "answer_text": "Most pumps under 10 HP operate equally well horizontal or vertical (except pumps that are only designed for vertical use only like wells and sump pumps). The drawback is that some small pumps and most large pumps are not designed to be supported by the pipe it is attached to. They are usually are designed to rest on a pad of concrete. Because of that, the bearings inside the pump probably are not designed to take the load of vertical installations. Maintenance would also become a challenge. ",

            "answer_text": "To run a horizontal pump vertically, one would need to be concerned with air being trapped where it shouldn\u2019t be such as the stuffing box area. The pump and motor bearings would not be designed to carry the axial weight of the rotating parts. Clearance adjustments might not work as intended as well. ",
