            "answer_text": "Sodium (Na) and potassium (K) are two different elements, but with similar properties. Each element has a unique atomic number (Z) which corresponds to the number of protons in the nucleus. Na: Z=11, K: Z=19. Therefore, they are not the same element, but are found in the same column of the periodic table.  They both have one valence electron, they both combine in a 1:1 ratio with chlorine to make NaCl and KCl, they both are classified as alkali metals which means that they react vigorously with water to make a solution of NaOH or KOH, and liberate hydrogen gas in the process.\u2026. Na(s) + H2O(l) \u2192 NaOH(aq) + H2(g)\u2026. K(s) + H2O(l) \u2192 KOH(aq) + H2(g) Potassium reacts more vigorously with water than does sodium:  The ions of sodium (Na\u207a) and potassium (K\u207a) both have important but different roles in the chemistry of the body. The bottom line is that sodium and potassium are similar metals, have similar properties and similar atomic structure. Check the Wikipedia articles on sodium and potassium to find out more. ",

            "answer_text": "No two chemical elements are \u201cthe same\u201d although some are extremely similar (lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium, for instance). Sodium and potassium are pretty similar, both being alkali metals, but potassium has a higher atomic number and weight, is more reactive in its elemental form than sodium, and forms an insoluble salt with dodecylsulfuric acid while sodium\u2019s salt is soluble.
