            "answer_text": "If a particle has size and no additional features, then if we arbitrarily nominate a point not at the centre, we can draw a line between that point and the centre. If the spin is zero, it has a fixed orientation towards an external frame of reference and zero angular momentum, thus disobeying the Uncertainty Principle. Accordingly, it must have angular momentum, and that is describable by a wave function. A wave must have a crest and a trough to define a period, so since it has no inherent nodes through spherical symmetry, it takes two revolutions to complete a period, hence the spin 1/2. It is possible to have different spins by having multiple degrees of angular freedom, thus the photon has two degrees of freedom through having two waves progress normal to each other. ",
