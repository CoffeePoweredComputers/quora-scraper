            "answer_text": "In any particular circuit in which the electrical resistance does not change as current increases and in which there are no other changes in variables that affect resistance, the \u201cdrift velocity\u201d (Microscopic View of Electric current) of electrons will be simply proportional to the applied potential difference. What is surprising in circuits with metal wires is that the average kinetic energy of the electrons in the wires is not significantly affected by changes in potential difference. The reason for this is that current-carrying electrons in metal have random speeds on the order of one million meters per second. These speeds are understood on the basis of the quantum mechanics of available energy levels rather than on ideas from classical physics. Because of this the speeds are not affected by temperature unless temperatures get unusually high. The drift velocity is what is produced by the applied potential difference while the random electron motions average to zero. Typically the drift velocities will be less than a millimeter/s, and this makes a difference to the average electron speed of less than one part in a billion. That will increase the average electron kinetic energy by less than two parts in a billion. In summary increasing potential difference will increase drift velocity proportionally while having negligible effect on average electron speed. In most circuits, as current increases, wire temperature increases causing resistance to increase so that increasing potential difference doesn\u2019t increase drift velocity proportionally. In semiconductors and gas tubes such as fluorescent tubes increasing potential difference tends to increase the number of charge carriers while reducing resistance. In some cases this can result in reductions in average speeds of charge carriers. ",

            "answer_text": "The physics book analogy between water and electricity helps me not at all. However, to get more amps through the same size wire you have to do one of two things - either increase the speed or increase the number. I think that primarily one increases the speed. According to Speed of electricity - Wikipedia, the drift velocity of electrons is millimeters per hour. I can\u2019t find my Modern Physics book (by Tipler). There is a an example for calculating the electron speed which I am pretty sure includes the voltage. In this question: What is the speed of electric current? If I switch on a light, how will I know how much time it would take for the light to glow?, there are answers that relate the speed to the current. Since the current is proportional to the voltage, this seems a proof. ",
