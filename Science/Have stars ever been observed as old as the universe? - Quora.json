It has an age and an uncertainty in that age. The universe has an age and an uncertainty in that age. The uncertainties overlap to make it possible, according to the numbers, that the Methuselah Star is older than the universe. Guess what? There are no stars older than the universe. Either the Methuselah Star is younger than its oldest estimated age, or the universe is older than than its youngest estimated age. Maybe both. In other words discussion of it is a numbers game, a matter of being confused or it\u2019s a deliberate attempt at fake news. How Can a Star Be Older Than the Universe? ",

            "answer_text": "Have stars ever been observed as old as the universe? Current understanding is that the first couple of hundred thousand years (380000 years, to be precise) after the Big Bang was a period of only rsdiation. Matter stabilized only after this period and clumps of matter formed the first stars after about 400 million years. Hence theoretically a star is always younger than the Universe by atleast 400 million years. ",
