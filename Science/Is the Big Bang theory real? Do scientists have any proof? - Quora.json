            "answer_text": "First of all: mathematicians prove theorems. Physicists don\u2019t prove anything. They observe, they organize the observations, they find common patterns\u2026 And if all goes to plan, after a lot of work they may formulate a theory (th\u00ea\u00b4e-r\u00ea, th\u00eer\u00b4\u00ea) nounplural theories1. a. Systematically organized knowledge applicable in a relatively wide variety of circumstances, especially a system of assumptions, accepted principles, and rules of procedure devised to analyze, predict, or otherwise explain the nature or behavior of a specified set of phenomena. b. Such knowledge or such a system. [Source: American Heritage Dictionary] A theory is never proven. It may be disproven (falsified) if contrary observational evidence emerges, in which case the theory must be modified or, if it cannot be modified, it must be discarded. Second: When you open a modern textbook on physical cosmology, it is unlikely that you will ever encounter the term, \u201cbig bang theory\u201d. That is because that\u2019s not what the theory is. The theory, or rather theories, used in physical cosmology, include the theory of general relativity and quantum field theory as well as bits and pieces from other branches of theoretical physics. Third: Contrary to popular notion, it did not \u201call start with a Big Bang\u201d. That would be putting the cart before the horse. Let\u2019s start with the horse instead: Present-day observations of the cosmos. These include, in no particular order, the distance-redshift relationship of distant objects (aka. the Hubble law), the existence of the cosmic microwave background radiation, its blackbody spectrum, the statistical properties of small deviations from that blackbody spectrum, the statistical distribution of matter on extragalactic scales, the immature appearance of very distant (presumed to be very young) galaxies, the metal-poor nature of such galaxies, the observed ratio of primordial hydrogen, deuterium, helium and lithium, etc. When we hitch the cart after the horse, that is, when we apply our physical theories (themselves developed through countless other observations, both in the laboratory and through astronomy) a coherent picture emerges: General relativity describes an expanding universe that, some 13.8 billion years in the past, was very hot and very dense, expanding very rapidly as it cooled and as the first atoms other than hydrogen formed. We can go back in time to what appears to be the first picosecond of the existence of this universe and describe it with good confidence, as the physics being applied is well understood. We cannot go back further: at this point, physics becomes very speculative, applied in a realm about which we have no factual information (that is to say, temperatures and pressures far above what can be achieved even in the largest particle accelerator.) So there. Anything after the first picosecond we can describe with reasonably high confidence, as we are on fairly firm ground with knowledge that has been tested many different ways. So the notion that the early universe was very hot and very dense is based on a firm foundation. Anything within the first picosecond (if it was indeed a picosecond; we don\u2019t even know that for sure): our knowledge in the realm is shaky at best, but mostly non-existent. The phrase, \u201cBig Bang,\u201d by the way, was coined by the astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle in a 1949 BBC radio show. He was ridiculing the concept of an expanding universe (at the time, the only observational support in favor was the Hubble law) as he was an advocate of an alternative called Steady State cosmology. (His exact words actually amount to a mischaracterization of the actual science: \u201cThese theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past.\u201d No such hypothesis is required, or employed, in the standard cosmology.) Since then, numerous key predictions of the expanding universe cosmology were confirmed by observation (most notable among them the 1965 discovery of the predicted cosmic microwave background), some of which do not exist at all in the steady state model. Most importantly, the steady state model requires an additional, ad hoc assumption (the spontaneous creation of particles of matter in empty space) whereas the standard Big Bang cosmology is based in its entirety on known physics, with no additional ad hoc postulates or assumptions.

            "answer_text": "No, First of all we need to understand a little about the supposed \u2018evidence\u2019 for the \u2018big bang\u2019. Many may not realize that to date, the \u2018big bang\u2019 has consisted of much speculation based on only three pieces of observation, all of which have alternative possible explanations. One of these \u2018evidences\u2019 is the microwave radiation coming in from all directions. This radiation (the same as would be given off by heat) is interpreted as the \u2018echo\u2019 or \u2018left-over heat\u2019 of the big fireball that started everything off. This radiation has in the past been found to be extremely uniform\u2014it\u2019s the same everywhere! However, because the universe itself has been found to be extremely clumpy (with great walls of galaxies, and great voids in between) then, if this happened as a result of the \u2018big bang\u2019, this background radiation should also be clumpy. In other words, the temperature of this radiation should be uneven\u2014there should be hot spots and cold spots. Because the radiation had been found to be so uniform, even secular scientists were saying that the \u2018big bang\u2019 idea was in trouble. The search for an unevenness in the radiation became intense. Recently, however, the press were told that the \u2018big bang\u2019 had been rescued because new measurements showed the unevenness the \u2018big bang\u2019 adherents were looking for. The press announced to the world that the \u2018big bang\u2019 had been proved, and God was now redundant. But, what did they really find? The temperature differences that have been discovered, and which have caused such a worshipful reaction, are around 30 millionths of a degree! However, these differences may not even be real. At a creation lecture in the USA recently, a man rose and said he was part of the team which designed the instruments used to make these measurements, and he could categorically say that they were not even that sensitive! This is confirmed in the journal Science of May 1, 1992 (p. 612): the variations claimed are \u2018well below the level of instrumental noise\u2019\u2014they have been obtained by statistical methods which still need careful checking. Also, from the same article, the opinion of George Smoot, the man in charge of the project, is that \u2018he\u2019s pretty sure the effect he\u2019s seeing is real but adds that there\u2019s always a chance it\u2019s wrong\u2019. Even if the measurements are real, Smoot admits \u2018it can be caused by other effects, such as the motion of our galaxy through the background radiation.\u2019 Thirty millionths of a degree, even if real, is not much to get excited about anyway. Imagine scanning a floor tile with a temperature probe. Even if the whole surface at first appears to be the same temperature, if you make instruments more and more sensitive you will eventually find some patches which are ever so slightly warmer or colder than others, as nothing is ever perfectly uniform. Brainwashed Even if real, Nature (March 30, 1992, p. 731) concludes that all one can say is that they are \u2018consistent with the doctrine of the Big Bang\u2019, and that it is a \u2018cause of some alarm\u2019 that the media has called it \u2018proof that \u201cwe now know\u201d? how the Universe began.\u2019 Sadly, many will never read the scientific journals for the truth about this information, and will go on believing a lie they have been indoctrinated with by the anti-God secular media. Many people don\u2019t realize how brainwashed they have become. \u2018Big bang\u2019 theory also seems to need the associated concepts of \u2018inflation\u2019 (an assumed early rapid expansion) and \u2018dark matter\u2019 (the belief that more than 90 per cent of the universe\u2019s mass is made up of a mysterious, unobservable and unknown substance). The same Nature paper also says that neither of these has any \u2018true independent support, outside the cosmological arena for which they were invented.\u2019 It goes on to indicate that those with alternative theories to the \u2018big bang\u2019 will probably be able to \u2018claim the new data as support for their theories also\u2019. Reading this calm, objective assessment in a leading journal makes it clear that no one has come remotely close to proving that there was a \u2018big bang\u2019. Scientific theories are always changing. What seems to fit a few facts in one generation may be replaced by a totally different view which fits those facts and even more. There are already observations which do not presently fit the \u2018big bang\u2019. One prominent group of astronomers believes that the facts better fit a new version of the steady-state theory\u2014not only no explosive beginning, but no beginning at all\u2014an eternal universe. If the next generation of astronomers adopts that view, what will be the position of those theologians who have been pressured into believing (contrary to God\u2019s revelation) that the \u2018big bang\u2019 was \u2018God\u2019s method of creating\u2019?
