            "answer_text": "1. White Tiger Arvind Adiga\u2019s debut novel White Tiger was widely acclaimed for its refreshing take on contradictions and social disparities in contemporary India based on class. The book is a thrilling narrative told from the perspective of Balram Halwai, a young man from a poverty-stricken remote village who moves to the capital to work as a chauffeur for the rich. Adiga won The Man Booker prize for this work and that too on his debut novel. 2. The Great Indian Novel This satirical novel by Shashi Tharoor recreates the Hindu epic Mahabharata within the context of the Indian Independence Movement and its following decades to become one of the most exciting reads in contemporary Indian literature. Recasting figures from India\u2019s freedom struggle and politics as mythological characters from a 2,000-year-old epic, his work is a powerful read regardless of how familiar you are with the country. 3. Train to Pakistan This historical Indian book by Khushwant Singh was widely revered during its release in 1956 for bringing a human perspective to the partition of British India into India and Pakistan. While most accounts of the partition at the time primarily focused on political aspects, Singh recounted the event in terms of human loss and horror. It is the summer of 1947. But Partition does not mean much to the Sikhs and Muslims of Mano Majra, a village on the border of India and Pakistan. Then, a local money-lender is murdered, and suspicion falls upon Juggut Singh, the village gangster who is in love with a Muslim girl. When a train arrives, carrying the bodies of dead Sikhs, the village is transformed into a battlefield, and neither the magistrate nor the police are able to stem the rising tide of violence. Amidst conflicting loyalties, it is left to Juggut Singh to redeem himself and reclaim peace for his village. First published in 1956, Train to Pakistan is a classic of modern Indian fiction. 4.The Guide R.K. Narayan is among the most read and celebrated authors in Indian books and literature. Based in the famous fictional town of Malgudi in South India, it follows the story of a Railway Raju, a corrupt tour guide, and the odd sequence of events which go on to make him a spiritual guide and eventually a revered holy man in the country. 5. God of small things Arundhati Roy\u2019s debut novel is a modern classic that has been read and loved worldwide. Equal parts powerful family saga, forbidden love story, and piercing political drama, it is the story of an affluent Indian family forever changed by one fateful day in 1969. The seven-year-old twins Estha and Rahel see their world shaken irrevokably by the arrival of their beautiful young cousin, Sophie. It is an event that will lead to an illicit liaison and tragedies accidental and intentional, exposing \u201cbig things [that] lurk unsaid\u201d in a country drifting dangerously toward unrest. 6.A Suitable Boy Vikram Seth\u2019s acclaimed work follows the story of four families in newly independent and post-partition India. Primarily revolving around the journey of Mrs. Rupa Mehra to find \u2018a suitable boy\u2019 to marry her daughter, the book meditates on a range of issues from post-partition politics, Hindu-Muslim strife, caste and class tensions, and changing family relationships. At 1,349 pages, Seth\u2019s work is among the longest English language Indian books ever published in a single volume. ",

            "answer_text": "Some of my personal favorite books authored by Indian authors: 1. A Fine Balance: this is one of the most heart wrenching stories ever and extremely well written by Rohinton Mistry. 2. Shalimar the Clown: written by Salman Rushdie, paints a poignant picture of the Paradise that was Kashmir and its subsequent fall from grace, as it parallels the lives of Shalimar and Boonyi's idyllic love and their descent into madness and revenge. 3. The God of Small Things: Arundhati Roy is a master of prose and her beautiful descriptions and the images she conjures are brilliant. 4. Family Matters: Another masterpiece from Rohinton Mistry as he walks us through the everyday travails of a Parsi family as it struggles to live while caring for the family patriarch. 5. The Great Indian Novel: A masterpiece by Shashi Tharoor that casts the Indian freedom struggle leaders and the post-independence politicians in the landscape of the Mahabharata. The re-telling is incisive and humorous and there is never a dull moment. 6. Midnight's Children: Salman Rushdie broke into the big league with his novel that told of story of India's journey as a free nation in parallel to one of its citizens born at the stroke of midnight as India was born. 7. Palace of Illusions: a re-telling of the Mahabharata from the perspective of Draupadi, the Pandava Queen. 8. The Chronicles of a Corpse Bearer: A heart-rending tale of the corpse bearers of Parsis in Bombay 9. The Guide: R.K. Narayan's masterpiece is a work for all ages and is unparalleled in its simplicity of prose and complexity of emotions. 10. Unaccustomed Earth: Jhumpa Lahiri is one of the best writers with her sense of nostalgia and melancholy that is reflected through her works. Unaccustomed Earth is a story that stays with you long after you've finished reading it. ",

            "answer_text": "So many good ones, its really hard to narrow down to just three!!! But here's what I have :- 1. The Namesake.   This is my absolute favorite. People have complained about it being too slow. Well, it is slow, but that is the beauty of it. It spans the life of a character, so true, so plausible. You actually grow up with him through the book. What I like most about the book is that the hero is flawed, imperfect. So many books frame the heroes as impeccable and having an unblemished life. \"The Namesake\", on the other hand, remains connected to reality throughout. You see the mistakes that the protagonist is making, but you also kinda understand why he's making it. And you love and loathe him for it. Also the beautiful writing of Jhumpa Lahiri doesn't hurt. 2. The Room on the Roof   I have been a big fan of Ruskin Bond ever since I read \"The Tunnel\" in the 4th grade. In most of his works, there is not a lot of plot. You have a sensation of the story not being written as much as writing itself. Sometimes when I read fiction, I have an expectation of what's going to come ahead. I am usually most happy when some unexpected twist proves me wrong (borne out of reading so many thrillers and mysteries). But with Ruskin Bond, I have felt that he doesn't write to trump his readers. He somehow walks together with the reader and what comes along is as much a discovery for him as much as it is to us. Also his usually detached delivery of the scene cooks up feelings in me that somehow are mine and not what he pointed I should feel. 3. I shall not hear the Nightingale   There is a lot of very good literature (both fiction and non-fiction) about the pre-1947 times in India. They speak about heroic tales of freedom-fighters, what they and their family had to sacrifice for the country. This particular work is different. The act of bravery in here comes from a character you least expect it from. You learn that being brave doesn't mean you have to be exceptionally charismatic, educated or even have everything figured out. You just have to a certain sense of what is right, and what is wrong. Everybody around you, people more intelligent, more \"sophisticated\" say things that are reasonable and the-best-thing-to-do-for-everyone in the picture. But that doesn't make a wrong thing right. You can't help but gasp for breath with admiration for the courage shown by this person. Other honourable mentions:  \"A Village by the Sea\" by Anita Desai\"The White Tiger\" by Arvind Adiga\"Untouchable\" by Mulk Raj Anand\"Q & A\" by Vikas Swarup (I know but its pacy and I like it) ",

            "answer_text": "In a sea of books, it\u2019s hard to dole out suggestions that which ones are the best because there are so many. But when it comes to this, I\u2019ve noticed that the Indian authors are mentioned less as compared to the foreign ones. So thank you for asking, below are mention of some great Indian authors and there must read. Cherished their writing and the content. Vikram Seth (Book : A Suitable Boy) Vikram Seth (born 20 June 1952) is an Indian novelist and poet. He has written several novels and poetry books. He has received several awards including Padma Shri, Sahitya Akademi Award, Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, WH Smith Literary Award and Crossword Book Award. Seth's collections of poetry such as Mappings and Beastly Tales are notable contributions to the Indian English language poetry canon.  A Suitable Boy (Review) : This is a story of ordinary people set in post- independence Indian background, who are looking for a suitable boy for Lata\u2019s marriage. Lata is 19 and she believes in falling in love first. There\u2019s not only the pursuit of marriage and happiness but heartache and disappointment, which is universal. Throughout its sprawling 1474 pages, there was no emotion left unexplored and no character left misunderstood. Ruskin Bond (Book : The Blue Umbrella) The Blue Umbrella (Review) : It is set in the hills of Garhwal and captures the life of villagers who portray heroic characters. Basically, it captures the life in a village.  Ruskin Bond (born 19 May 1934) is an Indian author of British descent. He lives with his adopted family in Landour, in Mussoorie, India. The Indian Council for Child Education has recognized his role in the growth of children's literature in India. He got the Sahitya Academy Award in 1992 for Our Trees Still Grow in Dehra, for his published work in English. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1999 and Padma Bhushan in 2014. Upamanyu Chatterjee (Book : English, August: An Indian Story) English, August: An Indian Story (Review) : If you have been to any government office or if you\u2019re working there, then this book is a must read. Upamanyu Chatterjee has presented how things work in an Indian office and it\u2019s refreshingly funny. The story revolves around Agastya Sen and how his life changes when he goes to Madna, a small town. The author has also drawn heavily from his own experience in the Indian administrative service to paint a picture of rural India.  Upamanyu Chatterjee (born 1959) is an Indian civil servant who currently serves as Joint Secretary to Government of India on the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board. He is a 1983 batch Indian Administrative Service officer from Maharashtra Cadre. Arundhati Roy (Book : The God of Small Things) The God of Small Things ( Review) : Roy\u2019s debut novel is a masterpiece. The book pivots around tragedy and hope. The book also explores the full range of human emotion.  Suzanna Arundhati Roy (born 24 November 1961) is an Indian author who is best known for her novel The God of Small Things (1997), which won the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1997. This novel became the biggest-selling book by a nonexpatriate Indian author. She is also a political activist involved in human rights and environmental causes. Kiran Desai (Book : The Inheritance of Loss) The Inheritance Of Loss (Review) :Despite the humor and wittiness encompassing it, The Inheritance of Loss remains a powerful book written with sheer honesty. The inner struggles of the characters could not be conveyed any better. Desai has the capacity to place the exact words on the most abstract feelings! The book is unflinchingly honest. My favorite quote from this book is: \u201dSadness was so claustrophobic\u2019.\u201d  Kiran Desai is the daughter of Anita Desai, herself short-listed for the Booker Prize on three occasions. She was born in Chandigarh on the 3rd of September, and spent the early years of her life in Pune and Mumbai. She studied in the Cathedral and John Connon School. She left India at 14, and she and her mother then lived in England for a year, and then moved to the United States, where she studied creative writing at Bennington College, Hollins University, and Columbia University. Aravind Adiga (Book : The White Tiger) The White Tiger (Review) : The novel examines issues of religion, caste, loyalty, corruption and poverty in India. The story revolves around Balram, who worked his way out from his low social caste and how he became successful and how he overcame all the social obstacles.  Aravind Adiga (born 23 October 1974) is an Indian-Australian writer and journalist. His debut novel, The White Tiger, won the 2008 Man Booker Prize. Shashi Tharoor (Book : The Great Indian Novel) The Great Indian Novel (Review) : In this novel, Tharoor has masterfully recast the Mahabharata. He has compared the political figures of India with the characters of the Mahabharat. It\u2019s basically a retelling of the Indian epic, but it falls in the realm of political satire by drawing parallels with major events in India\u2019s political history during the freedom movement and the post-independence era. (Although a controversial figure!)  Shashi Tharoor (born 9 March 1956) is an Indian politician and a former diplomat who is currently serving as Member of Parliament of India (from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala since 2009). He also currently serves as Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs. Tharoor is a globally recognised speaker too, on India's economics and politics, as well as on freedom of the press, human rights, Indian culture, and international affairs.

            "answer_text": "\"Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal\" (Some People at Some times) written by Jayakanthan. Previously named as \"Kalangal Maarum\"(Times change).    Ganga, a college student from a Tamil Brahmin family, has a sexual encounter with a stranger who offers her lift on a rainy day. Ganga is uncertain about her participation in the event. She, overcome by guilt and self-loathing, construes the event as rape. She confessed to her mother about what happened earlier. Overhearing this, Ganga's brother, who's the 'bread' winner of the family, disowns and evicts her from the house. She then moves in with her uncle\u2014mother's elder brother in Madras\u2014who assures full support in continuing her education. After successful graduation she gets employed in a private firm and grows to take the top managerial position. Ganga until then lives a life with her mother resisting the pressure to lie about the 'incident' (which, presumably, would ruin her life with another man). Her assumed status as a 'spoilt' woman also implicitly encourages her lecherous uncle to make sexual advances. It is during this time she chances up on the 'stranger', Prabhu. (Prabhu is a rich man living with his wife and her daughter but leading an unhappy life because of misunderstanding with his wife as he is irresponsible both as a father and as a husband). Ganga musters up the courage to introduce herself as who 'she really is' and get Prabhu to discuss about 'that' fateful evening. She then realizes that she probably showed as much interest in the sex as did Prabhu. The revelation brings Ganga closer to Prabhu as friends. They find their characteristics agreeable and the friendship matures into love. But unable to transcend the society's norms, Prabhu advices her to get married to someone else. When all attempts to convince Prabhu fails, Ganga is forced to part ways with him. Feeling bad of this, Ganga's character changed arrogant completely.  P.S : The novel got Sahithya Academy award. The novel later adapted to a movie with same name, getting a huge positive response, it became the first Tamil film to feature Best Female Actor winning Performance, won by Lakshmi for her portrayal of the lead character Ganga.  Ezham Ulagam (Seventh World) - Jayamohan.  The novel about the unknown dark life of Handicapped Beggars. The novel talks about their life, happiness, celebrations, pains, love. The author created each characters with special care.  The agent who takes care of these people dont even consider them as persons. He just mention them as \"Uruppadigal\"(items).   photo courtesy : Gowtham Ramnath But these people forgetting all their sorrows, living as a joint family and live in their separate world.  We need to cross many painful pages in this novel. For the libido of a policemen, young lady is sent to him. A new-born child has been put on mid-day sun so that the people get mercy and give money. The handicapped people whom they think no more useful are handed-over to some other agents for money. The climax of the novel had a very deep impact in my heart. During the course of the story, the lady named Muthammai was forced to have sexual relationship with physically challenged persons to give birth to physically challenged children. She was forced to do this many times. In the end, she was again forced to have a sex with a drunken handicapped guy. While he touches her, she saw his hand and started shouting \"OTTRAI VIRAL, OTTRAI VIRAL\"(one finger, one finger). He was one of her handicapped children who were separated from him and she realized it. Muthammai was in a condition to have sex with his own son to give away a handicapped child. The novel ends with this. P.S : This story is adapted to a movie \"NAAN KADAVUL\" by Director Bala which earns him a National Award. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many. But recently released is this book. Men are from Earth, Women are from Earth - A New Scripture for Men and Women. The books speaks about Men and Women relationship. Gender conditioning since centuries. A very heavy topic has been written in a very simple and light manner. Balancing between the old psychology and new degrading psychology.  Today\u2019s mankind is a product of the culture of thousands of years. From the time we are born, we are socialized into playing traditional gender roles. Certain differences between the sexes are natural while the others are cultural and social (manmade). Be it any relationship, there are men and women involved. The kind of relationship we share with the same or opposite gender stems from our very first relationship with that gender, that is, with a mother and a father. And this is what the book deals with. Delving into the dynamics of these relationships, it brings forth a new definition of what it means to be a man or a woman through the characters Rhea, Siddhartha and Rohan. Here\u2019s a paragraph from the book: After listening to Rhea\u2019s case-studies and talks, his life events kept flashing before him; he felt deep pain and anger that he had numbed long ago. She had spoken on the lines of, \u2018Why do so many men have the impulse to disrespect, hate or violate women? Where does that really come from? And how do we stop it? To understand misogyny, we have to explore the first relationship a man ever has with a woman\u2014with his mother.\u2019 Book: Men are from Earth Women are from Earth - A New Scripture for Men and Women. Another Paragraph: Raina had just finished his coaching with me at that time. He kept apologizing for this indecent behavior and asked me not to leave the party. He instead asked his security guard to throw out that director-producer. He lost his movie as well. What these sexual predators don\u2019t understand is they are saying loud and clear to the whole world that \u2018their self-esteem is very low, they need a proof of their manhood by such acts, and they need a therapist. It also speaks about their first relationship with the female gender\u2014their mother and also about the kind of relationship his mother and father had\u2019. Not just them. Even the people who speak in a language like \u2018I just check out her moves, and body parts, the way they speak about having sex, etc.\u2019 There is so much disrespect to that woman. Now the man who himself has low self-esteem, how will he think of someone else\u2019s esteem? You hear them a lot on TV shows, chat shows and interviews, read on the internet and newspapers, but I also hear them in my clinic.

            "answer_text": "The question being too broad in scope, I would restrict myself to Indian Writing in English (IWE). But before doing that, I'd tell you what excites me most about IWE. It's when the authors try to express an Indian essence through an alien language, and in the way constructs an altogether different narrative style. On this line, let me tell you some of the best works in English by Indian authors. 1. A Fine Balance - Rohinton Mistry This book is 'The Best Book' I've read so far; and trust me, I've read a lot. If you want to read a book that is unputdownable, depressing, hopeful, charming and sad at the same time, go for it. You will cry, you will laugh, you'll want to pull out the characters and kill them, you'll feel the pain and you'll gasp with pleasure.    2. The Calcutta Chromosome - Amitav Ghosh While I was going through the pre-climax portions of it, my mom had to literally yell at me to make me have my dinner. Yes, this is enchanting. A historical sci-fi horror story about the adventures of a maniac in search of 'The Calcutta Chromosome' via the research done by Sir Ronald Ross on Malaria... Aah! Still not a complete description. And there are, I guess, 4 timelines running throughout. And I had a nightmare about one of the scenes - the scariest I've ever read.  3. Haroun and the Sea of Stories - Salman Rushdie Yes, I've read his Midnight's Children. And no, it's not in the list. It's a novel that Rushdie wrote for his son. It's children's fiction at its best. And yet, it is as much for adults as it is for children. Interesting names, inetersting plot, interesting narrative and a magical world. If you miss your grandpa's and grandma's stories that they told you with so much vigour when you were a kid, go for it. It may not be as good as those stories not because it is bad but because grandparents' stories were and will always be The Best!   4. Untouchable - Mulk Raj Anand This book will make you cringe with fear and disgust through its depiction of the atrocities that were faced by 'Untouchables'. Set in the pre-independence era, it tells you the horror that was an untouchable's life. And what a master-stroke of a climax. Read it to believe it!   5. Family Matters - Rohinton Mistry Rohinton Mistry makes a comeback with his heart-wrenching tale of a Parsi family. Though not as depressing as A Fine Balance, it'll make you cry your heart out at the miseries of the characters. The central character of Nareeman Vakil will stay with you for many years, and possibly forever!    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Those which almost made it to the list -             ",

            "answer_text": "I am going to add a few books as separate comments with the book's Name, Author and a brief description of the plot. Delhi - Khushwant Singh Singh blends facts and fiction in this glamoured story telling of Delhi's birth from its ancient cities. You'll read accounts set in your favorite city, some true, others exaggerated, all in all, making for a guilty pleasure read that's hard to put down. Ofcourse , Singh adds his own flavors to add to the narrative. Midnight\u2019s Children - Salman Rushdie This is a difficult book, no doubts about it. Rushdie is a powerful writer when it comes to magical realism. His prose is dense, and sometimes it will feel like you\u2019re navigating a thick forest of words. This book is not for everyone, but if you want to read India\u2019s best novels to the world, Rushdie will not be ignored A Fine Balance - Rohiton Mistry One of our most talented writers weaves a story of 4 unlikely friends: a housewife learning to be independent, a Muslim Dalit tailor and his nephew and a paying guest who doesn\u2019t know what to do with his life. This story is set in the emergency-era in India, and it has won several awards. Don\u2019t miss this treasure The Lives of Others - Neel Mukherjee Fat novel about a Bengali joint family where all family members react differently to their son becoming a Naxalite The Hungry Tide - Amitav Ghosh An excellent first book to read and you will be hooked from the first chapter. This is the story of a marine biologist exploring the wetlands of the Sundarbans area while living with a local family Barrister Parvatisam - (Telugu) - Mokkapati Narasimha Sastry Fantastic and humorous novel. I don't know if it has translations and if they are good. But goddamn this is one of the gems. The Discovery of India - Jawaharlal Nehru Love him, hate him, Nehruji writes quite beautifully the story of India from the Indus River Valley Civilization to the modern age dilemma of imperialism and the world wars. The Discovery of India builds a narrative of India\u2019s development as a cultural entity and as a diverse group of people and religions throughout the ages. The book shows the sheer amount of research and work that went into it. Nehru writes like a well versed scholar of Indian History and crafts quite a story to show how far we\u2019ve come and where we\u2019ve yet to go. It remains rather apolitical when speaking purely about Indian history but of course you\u2019ll see that nationalistic and anti imperialistic slant, not exactly a bad thing because Nehru tries to remain fair to history. It\u2019s quite a good book. Highly recommend a read even if you dislike Nehru because it\u2019s a book that all Indians can enjoy. The God of Small Things - Arundhati Roy (I know you've already called out Roy in the OP, but nominating Utmost Happiness and not tGoST is criminal IMO) The historical fiction trilogy of Sei Somoy (Those Days), Prothom Alo (First Light) and Purbo-Paschim (East and West) are absolutely incredible pieces of work by Sunil Ganguly. Gaban, Godan, Karmbhumi and Shatranj Ke Khiladi by Munshi Premchand. Rebati, Dhulia Baba and Cha Mana Atha Guntha by Fakir Mohan Senapati. The Demon Seed and Kalaam by MT Vasudevan Nair Gitanjali, Gora, Gara Baire by Tagore. English, August by Upamanyu Chatterjee A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry Em and The Big Hoom by Jerry Pinto Our Moon Has Blood Clots by Rahul Pandita Discovery of India by Pt. Nehru Train to Pakistan and Cuckold by Khuswant Singh. The Shadow Lines by Amitav Ghosh A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth - amazing piece of historical fiction. Even though a very thick book, it's really well written researched and written. I love how his portrayal of different facets of post-independence India. I seriously recommend it. Maximum City - Suketu Mehta Eminently well researched, enjoyable, honest and no holds barred non fiction about Mumbai. The Way Things Were - Aatish Taseer Story about a father\u2019s death and his son rediscovering this family\u2019s life before his birth. This novel spans many decades and explores how India has changed since the Age of the Maharaajaas. The Lowlands - Jhumpa Lahiri The story of what happens when a passionate man gets killed for his political activities and his brother is left cleaning up the mess of their personal lives The Ministry of Utmost Happiness - Arundhati Roy Imagine The God of Small Things but better and more relevant, this is a fat, hard to read book, so you might want to save it for later One part woman - Perumal Murugan An important read because it highlights the complexity of traditional practices in rural India, which stirred controversies and protests All I can think of from the top of my head! of course, Malgudi Days, Guide and other stories from RK Narayan, almost everything Ruskin Bond has written (Shout out to Blue Umbrella), Feluda by Satyajit Ray need to be there in that list. Just can't choose one! ",

            "answer_text": "There are some Indian authors who have changed the art of story-telling in the Indian literary landscape: Some of my favorites Indian books are the following:1) The Calcutta Chromosome by Amitav Ghosh.  The book has been awarded the Arthur C Clarke award for best science-fiction novel in 1997.The story is a heady cocktail of fact, fiction, science and mystical practices. It mixes some Hindu beliefs and modern-day scientific concepts and the story once you are into it is \"UNPUTDOWNABLE\". It is one of those books which does not give you all the clues and you need to think and I mean think hard to know what exactly happened in the end! 2) Train to Pakistan by Khuswant Singh  This is one of those books which is read widely and heavily quoted from even 57 years after it was first published.  The book depicts the partition riots between India and Pakistan in 1947 from a local foci of a village. It shows the realistic face of hardships faced by both communities, the local administrative authorities, an alien Samaritan with a backdrop of a torn love story. It paints raw human emotions at its finest. The book is still popular among literary circles because the story is applicable to even present-day situations 3. A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth  Firstly, one should read this book only when he/she is confident of reading a 1000+ pages book. A Suitable Boy is one of the longest books written in a single volume as it is 1349 pages in length. But, once you get into the groove of this book, it is a book which has myriad shades amalgamated into one. The book is a story of four families over a period of 18 months as a mother searches for a suitable boy to marry her daughter. The book is set in post-independence India and deals with issues like strife between Hindu and Muslims, abolition of the Zamindari system, land reforms and empowerment of Muslim women. It is a mammoth masterpiece and has won the Best Book, Commonwealth Writers Prize in 1994. 4. God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy  The debut book by Arundhati Roy won the booker prize in 1997. The book deals experiences of fraternal twins who are always preached the \"Laws of Love\" which proclaims \"who should be loved, and how. And how much\". The book's title aptly describes the story and tells the readers that sometimes though the big things are not in our hands; we can always take care of the small things.  After reading this novel, I hoped Arundhati Roy to write more because this is the only novel she has written till date.  5. Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri   Now, this is not a novel but Jhumpa Lahiri's debut work is one of those books which you cherish reading. It is a book collection of exactly nine short stories detailing lives of Indians and Indian Americans who are caught between their inherited culture and   the modern-day world. The book won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2000. The book mainly deals with relationships of different nature and different perspectives of people in the same situations. I have tried to paint the picture of Indian literary works in a diverse way here and hence have included these diverse out-of-the box books. There are many more books by Indian authors which are worth the attention, but these 5 from my reading experience are must-read novels. ",

            "answer_text": "Cuckold by Kiran Nagarkar Well\u2026.don\u2019t be fooled by its name..it may give you a giggle but the novel is more than that. Today, when most of the popular Indian historical fiction is retelling of mythological stories, this one is for those who have a different taste. Usually i\u2019d avoid Indian novels because i am more into fantasy and fiction, and most of the good Indian novels tend to deal with serious topics or romance or social problems. However, one day I came across this novel. And it\u2019s amazing. It was published in 1997 and won sahitya academy award in 2000. The novel is set in medieval India specifically in Rajputana era. The book tells the story of a turmoil in the mindset of ruling class. It\u2019s not a boring novel. It\u2019s detailed and illustrative and brilliant. Plot covers warfare, politics, internal ruling class problems and many more. And there is more to it that i wouldn\u2019t describe for fear of giving away spoilers. Just trust me on this if you are into historical fiction and want a masterpiece, this is it. Read it. And if you still have any doubt, read the reviews on various shopping sites to get the idea. Its got a sahitya academy award. They don\u2019t give that away for no reason, ",

            "answer_text": "Gachar Gochar by Vivek Shanbag and I just posted this review on Good Reads: Last night I was feeling unusually wakeful and active. Yet I did not want to get up and sit at the computer (something which I usually do). I remembered Jean Spraker\u2019s brilliant review of \u201cGachar Gochar) and immediately ordered it on Amazon.   Now, that was not a very smart thing to do. I should have ordered some feel good chicklit or picked up one of my old, well thumbed chicken soup series. Gachar Gochar made me feel caffeinated in a disturbing chaotic manner.  Now about the book.   Vivek Shanbag tells a poignant tale. He makes you listen to his story. He makes you listen to the mess in every character\u2019s head. You are drawn into the mad tangle of their being. You become a part of the constant din. As a writer, whose primary modality is auditory, this aspect enthralled me. Gachar Gochar is the story of a family(a joint one if you may call) who find their fortunes reversed. They move from their dingy ant infested house to a palatial house and overnight, the dynamics change. From a family who spends a sleepless night trying to tally the father\u2019s account book, they now become satellites round Chikappa and expend their energies to make him feel safe and protected deleting themselves in the process. I loved how the nameless narrator makes highly unsuccessful attempts to erase his loneliness through his conversations with Vincent\u2014the waiter from India Coffee House. Other Characters Chitra and Anita: Their vulnerability and intensity evoked a sense of loss within me. Their mess became mine. I loved them. Appa: From a man who once ruled a kingdom to a man who now laughs at his own jokes, this character moved me like no other. Amma: I wept for this woman. Chikappa: The king of the jungle who would go to any lengths to keep himself and his tribe safe. My favourite scene is the one where the protagonist (or the nameless narrator) buries his head in his wife\u2019s wardrobe after her departure to her parent\u2019s place. No I won\u2019t go into the intricacies. You have to read it and connect with it. The end is stunning. But so is the entire book.  A brilliant five stars to this book for keeping me awake throughout the night. ",

Beautiful, lyrical and evocative, Amitav Ghosh excels with this book. And it isn't even one of his more popular books. 2) The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy - (enough praises have been sung for this book in the many answers for this question but I cannot deny that this is one of my most favorite Indian author books ever. And it figures in my most favorite books list as well). 3) The Inner Courtyard, stories by Indian women(edited by Lakshmi Holmstrom) - Every story is unique and compelling.     4) Em and the Big Hoom by Jerry Pinto. 5) Swami and Friends by R.K. Narayan(I spent most of my childhood re-reading this).     6) The Guide.      7) The Inscrutable Americans by Anurag Mathur(a hoot and a half!)     8) The Moor's last sigh - Salman Rushdie.    ",

Or was she the reason for its destruction Surpanakha, meaning the woman as hard as nails was born as Meenakshi\u2014the one with beautiful, fish-shaped eyes. Growing up in the shadows of her brothers, who were destined to win wars, fame and prestige, she, instead, charts up a path filled with misery and revenge.

Trouble brews when Sanjay quits his government job and starts an immensely successful private practice. With affluence comes the neverending ambition for more and the inevitable slide into corrupt practices. For a long time, Mridula has no idea that Sanjay has sold his soul.

            "answer_text": "You may try following books written by Indian Writers: 1. The White Tiger by Arvind Adiga It is a social commentary on the effects of the huge gap between the wealthy and the poor in India. This large gap creates instability that often leads to morality being compromised for individual gain. The poor are so desperate that they are willing to do almost anything to make it out of poverty. At the same time, the rich are so far removed from the plight of the poor that they become desensitized and corrupt. The point of view from which the story is told, the use of humor, the patterns of imagery, and the end of the novel emphasize the disparity in wealth and the immorality that results. 2. Everybody Loves a Good Draught by P. Sainath. This book is acclaimed across the world and prescribed in over 100 universities and colleges. Everybody Loves a Good Drought is the established classic on rural poverty in India. Twenty years after publication, it remains unsurpassed in the scope and depth of reportage, providing an intimate view of the daily struggles of the poor and the efforts, often ludicrous, made to uplift them. 3. Wise and Otherwise by Sudha Murthy It is a collection of fifty vignettes of the real-life incidents of Murthy, which left a profound impression on her, both in good and bad ways. After reading this book, the readers will find a new way to look at life and people. This book will make them realize how small incidents can be a window of opportunity to understand myriad nature of human beings along with their virtues and vices. At the same time, a reader can realize how each moment and the small incidents in our life can be so inspiring and enriching if we give them our attention and thought just like the writer did. 4. Wings of Fire by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam It is an autobiographical novel that tells the readers a story about unlocking their inner potential. Kalam does a great deal to throw light on his journey to igniting the fire within himself. This book is divided into seven parts, and begins with an Introduction and Preface. This is then followed by an Orientation, which contains a quote from the Atharva Veda. After that, the readers are also enlightened on the incidents that made Kalam what he is today. 5. Ignited Minds by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Ignited Minds is a book by Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, the former President of India. In this book Dr. Kalam talks about his dream of developed India. The title of the book comes with a tag-line, \u201cUnleashing the power within India\u201d. The strength of this book by Dr. Kalam is that it has been written in an easy to understand language, where he presents some of the most difficult issues our country is facing today in a very simple way. The book has been divided into nine short chapters, each one of them dealing with various themes. Each chapter begins with a quote and ends with a summary giving the reader something to think about. 6. Train to Pakistan This historical Indian book by Khushwant Singh was widely revered during its release in 1956 for bringing a human perspective to the partition of British India into India and Pakistan. While most accounts of the partition at the time primarily focused on political aspects, Singh recounted the event in terms of human loss and horror. Train to Pakistan is an essential read for anyone looking to explore Indian literature or history. 7. The Guide The Guide follows the story of a Railway Raju, a corrupt tour guide, and the odd sequence of events which go on to make him a spiritual guide and eventually a revered holy man in the country. 8. India Grows At Night: A Liberal Case for a Strong State by Gurcharan Das 9. The Difficulty Of Being Good by Gurcharan Das Apart from the above, if someone is interested in books written by Indian Author in Hindi Language, then following are some of the gems of Hindi Literature: 1. Godan by Premchand. 2. Raag Darbaari by Shreelal Shukla. 3. Tamas by Bhism Sahni. 4. Gunahon ka Devtaa by Dharamveer Bharti. 5. Kitne Pakistan by Kamleswar. 6. Mahabhoj by Mannu Bhandaari. 7. Kurukshetra & Rashmirathi by Ramdhaari Singh Dinkar. Thanks for reading. ",

We can definitely find many  Anupamas, Anands and Radha akka in our Indian Society. It is a must read for every  young girl and boy before they turn 20. It is an evergreen epic  by Sudha Murthy. Hats off to her boldness and courage to create such realistic portrayals of each character of the novel2)One Night at the Call Center beautifully brought the problems faced by the youngsters of our modern India to lime light. Especially the conversation between God and the Call center employees, towards the end, was completely inspiring. I still read that chapter again and again whenever I feel down or dejected due to something in my life.3)The Old Man and his god helped me to understand the real values of various things in life. It reminds me that there is still humanity and kindness left in the place where I live. I am not sure if the old man and his wife who are portrayed in the story are still living to hear these words. But dear old man, I salute you from the bottom of my heart. Your words, made me realize what I want and what I do not want from life. 4)This Trilogy, setting apart the action packed way in which  Amish had narrated it and the various twists and suspense it had in store throughout the three books. I felt there were few most beautiful characters which were carved by Amish. My top favorite ones were Sati, Shiva, Parvateshwar and especially the old man who appeared in the second book (I am not sure whether it is second or third) at Ayodhya. He shared his little food with Shiva. There was self respect and kindness in his attitude. Though his role lasted only a page in the book, I felt, it showed me how to treat elders, when they grew older. That old man is my third favorite after Sati and Shiva.I cannot forget Sati, who fought till the very last moment with all her power, despite knowing the fact that she might die any moment!. She had the courage to admit her mistakes and at the same time stand up for her people till her last breathe!.5)Blue Umbrella is a must read for everyone on this earth. I will not disclose any more about it. Read it for yourself and find it. 5) I am not qualified enough to review this masterpiece of this uncrowned Fiction King of my motherland. We will always miss u sir!. Please buy this book if you have not and read it. Trust me, you will definitely have the most wonderful experience to last a life time. P.S: I am yet to read many other books by Indian authors. I shall further update it once I manage to read others. ",

The writers I am going to mention are the pillars of indian spiritual wisdom. Each and every youth should go through these books.

This book must- read for a youth who wishes to peep into indian spirituality.  The next book is Bestseller spiritual book by Praamhans Yogananda, the Kriya yoga master.

This well written book gives a detailed account of Babaji's life and teachings.  Swami Ramtirtha was a great poet also. One may read lovely prose and equally lovely poetry in this book. His works are the heritage of Indian ancient wisdom.  Sri Aurobindo's The Life Divine is a difficult book but whatever I could read and understand is that book is as priceless as any book of the world.  Swami Abedananda was another great disciple of Ramakrishna Paramhana. His philosophical notions are deeper than even Swami Vivekanands. He is one of the first men who inquired about Lord Jesus in India.  Meher Baba's God Speaks is as difficult as the Life Divine but at few places Baba ji has written so well that he may be counted among the best Indian saint authors.  Prof. N. Kasturi is known for his biography of Satya Sai Baba. But this book is about his communion with Babaji. This book is written in exquisite English. One may develop one's writing skill after reading this.  Narahari: Prophet of New India is a novel by one of the greatest Indian English poet, critic and novelist. The book was written under the tutelage of Sri Satya Sai Baba. A great book by a great author.  Osho spoke two books when he was in silence from public. This book saw the light of the day when he was with his close disciples. This is a lovely book of a spiritual master of our time.  Krishnamurti is one of the wisest seekers of our time. He has written so many books. But this book has fascinated me to the bone. The book is also liked by Osho who was his adversary. The foreword of this also well written by Alduos Huxley.  Those who have read Autobiography of a Yogi should read this book. They will come to realize how great and deep this saint was.  Swami Rama's Living With Himalayan Masters is his account of his days in the Himalayan Yogis. The book has also a pic of Jesus\u2019 tomb in Kashmir.  The present book 'Autobiography of a Sufi' is an account of the life of Mahatma Ramchandraji of Fatehgarh (Janab Laalaaji Maharaj). He is known as the first Sufi saint from the Hindu religion, who is fully authorized to train others and in turn to authorize them to do so in accordance with the Naqshbandi Sufi tradition. Autobiography of Sufi is a book about the life founder of Ramchandra ji of Shahjahanpur.  The Hearfulness Way is another book of Ramchandra Mission. I should pay my humble thanks to shri Deepak Tyagi ji for such a lovely book. The book will change your life if you read this carefully. I will write about this book in detail later.  Shri Ram Shrma Acharya ji is one of the great saints of previous century. He has written more than hundred books. Each and every book by him is worth reading but to me this book surpasses all other books. My father and I both were lovers of this book.  Bal Gngadhar Tilak's Gita Rahasya is one of the best books on The Holy Gita. The foreword of this book gives a detailed and thought provoking essay on Indian philosophy. Each and every reader of the Gita should go through this great book.  HH Swami Chinmayananda's commentary is his authoritative study of the celestial songs of the Geeta. One may guess the great and insightful knowledge of HH Swami ji Maharaj. The book is must for the Geeta lovers.  Gita with Purushartha Bodhini Commentary of Satwalekar (Set of 4 Volumes) is also a great commentary on the Gita. A must read book.  Anni Besant has written dozens of books and the book that charmed me is his The Ancient Wisdom. The book tell us about the eternal heritage that we all indian posses but are not aware of.  At the Feet of the Master by J. Krishnamurti was written when he was an adolescent. This is a very small yet very great book.  By His Grace by Dada Mukherjee is an account of Neem Karoli Babaji who is the guru of Sophia Lauren and Steve Jobs. The great book tells us that \u2018We are not following the guru; the guru actually is following us.\u2019  Bhagwan Das was a basically a theosohist. His teachings are basically an examination of the similar truths in the religions of the world. A seeker who wishes to find the underlying unity in all religion should read this great book.  There are many biographies of Shirdi Sai Baba. But this one is read among Baba lovers as book of japa. This is a great book in simple words and style.  Prof. B L Atreya was my maternal grandfather's teacher. This is the best book on Yoga Vashishtha. Each and every spiritual sadhak and youth should read yoga vashishtha because this book is the base of all indian knowledge system.  The Sufi Teachings of Hazrat Inayat Khan Sahab are sprawling in many volumes but the book The Bowl of Saki contains his teachings, wisdom and enlightenment for daily use.  The Gitanjali of Tagore is also an exquisite volume of poetry by noble laureate poet. These divine songs stir and tickle a devoted heart.  Toru Dutt's poetry is deeply drenched in Indian tradition. One can mark out her simplicity and lyrical quality in these poems. A worth reading collection.  Subodh Chandra Sengupta is known for his Shakespearian criticism but this book is written about his fellow teachers friends and his memoirs of youth and career as a teacher. It is a great Autobiography of a great teacher.  I will add more books when they flash through my heart. ",

            "answer_text": "I like Maximum City by Suketu Mehta. This is a non fiction book about Bombay (as it was called at that time). It describes what shaped the city and made it what it is and is also filled with anecdotes and stories of various people who came to Mumbai. There are chapters about the Underworld, the police, builders, politicians, immigrants from Bihar who live on the streets, the people working in dance bars and many more. Mehta is an author who actually lived in Mumbai and met the people whom he talks about in his book. This book has won many awards including the Pulitzer prize in 2005. Another book which I have not yet read but which I will get down to is A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth. That is an acknowledged classic that I think everyone who wishes to understand India needs to go through. I am describing myself when I say that most of the books that I have read in English are by western authors who do not talk about India. As a result for many years I did not do any reading about the country which I lived in. Reading books by Indian authors will be of practical use to you as it will tell you about India and Indians and help you understand them.\\ I look forward to reading the other answers to this question as I enjoy reading and like talking about books. Thanks for the question ",

            "answer_text": "These are the ones which I have read and thoroughly enjoyed. ________________________________________________ 1)The Krishna Key (Ashwin Sanghi)  The author can be called as the Indian Dan Brown. Rich in information and research, the book offers a unique perspective on Indian mythology. Based on this perspective and background, a thrilling story emerges where we are taken through the mysteries and science hidden in the ancient heartland of India. It takes us on a quest to find one of the most priced possessions of none other than Krishna himself. Inspite of the massive storyline and enthralling concepts, the story ends on a note of humbleness. 2) Swami and friends (RK Narayan)  Nothing tells about the innocence of childhood and the fantastic experience of growing up in India before the age of technology took over , better than this book. 3) Waiting for the Mahathma ( RK Narayan)  A fiction, telling the story of a boy, who falls in love with a girl, who is a disciple of Mahatma Gandhi and a freedom fighter. The boy joins the Indian freedom cause just for the girl. He then gets involved in it and makes it the aim of his life.Torn between desires to unite with each other and the fervent desire to fight for their nation, their decisions make way for an interesting read. 4) Shiva Trilogy (Amish Tripathi)  Beautifully written. Each description offered, each philosophy endorsed and each character sketched is worth hundreds of gallons. Deeply rooted in Indian mythology, it offers a unique perspective of Shiva, that of a common man, who rose to the occasion to save his people and country from evil. Depicted as a common man, each of the decision that he takes is under scrutiny and debatable. That is the beauty of these novels. It makes the readers question each philosophy offered for themselves and then understand them. Also offered in these books are wonderful and unique explanations for the concept of avatars,gods and many myths. I have read only the third part of the series.Even then it was an amazing experience. 5) Seven Conversations (Nistha Tripathi )  The book revolves around a person, who has a failed marriage and is afraid of the consequences that she has to face. At one stage, she is ready to take her own life. But, life has other plans for her. As the book progress, the reader is taken for an amazing journey along with the protoganist , getting access to the secrets of life contained in the holy book of Gita, and getting liberated at the end. The book has something for each type of reader. The wisdom offered in this book is something that only life can teach. 6) The White Tiger (by Aravind Adiga)  Describes the story of a boy,who climbs from the lower rungs of the social ladder into higher levels to become a successful entrepreneur 7)India after Gandhi (Ramachandra Guha)  You know the story of the birth of the nation of India. But do you know the story of the struggles and challenges that the nation had to go through while growing up? Do you know the persons who nurtured the system and this nation with their experience and knowledge to give it the shape that it has. The book constantly compares the idea of India as an experiment in the idea of democracy, prophecied at regular intervals to be doomed, but only to revive back with greater valor and strength. It makes us believe in the power of democracy and that we are going to achieve much greater heights. Books yet to be read: The Great Indian Novel(Shashi Tharoor)  The God of small things( Arundhathi Roy)  The argumentative Indian ( by Amartya Sen )  ",

            "answer_text": "This is one of the book I just read and I would definitely recommend it.Chanakya Chants by Ashwin Sanghi  This novel has two stories going simultaneously. First story which is 2300 years ago is about how Chanakya leads Chandragupta to become the king of India by defeating the brutal Dhanand and even stopping Aleaxander the great to enter the Great kingdom of Magadha. There are many witty lines by chanakya in the book. As we all know Chanakya's management skills are world renowned. This novel proves it all.Second story is about the present political system and how Gangasagar the protagonist leads Chandani to become first woman Prime minister of India. He does what it takes to thrash the ruling party.There are some similarities between the two stories.  Here are some quotes from the book:1. Friends come and go, Enemies accumulate. 2. A man on a date wonders if he'll get lucky but the woman already knows. 3. Battle is never about who is right, it is mostly about who is left. 4. The problem is that most things in life that are pleasurable are usually illegal, immoral or fattening. 5. No one is a virgin, life screws them all. 6. It's often easier to give forgiveness rather than permission ! 7. When a full house is adequate , why should I use straight flush?  8. In politics the only relevant currency is information. 9. Strange how women instantly depreciate in value the moment one acquires them. 10. A clear conscience is usually a sign of bad memory. 11. When two elephants fight, grass will suffer. 12. Worry is like a rocking chair; it keeps you in motion, but gets you nowhere. 13. Political power hopes to control the economic resources of the country. Economic power hopes to control the politicians. 14. Winning isn't only about increasing our stregth but also about reducing the enemy's. 15. One should never be too upright, it's always the straight trees that are cut down while the crooked ones are left standing. Happy Reading! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Sadly, many of the novels that you should be reading are written in vernacular languages. The translations of these works is most of the time pathetic or at best slightly readable. I will start with colonial writings so that you can get an understanding of how British saw India. Works of Rudyrad KiplingTake up the White man\u2019s burden \u2014Send forth the best ye breed \u2014Go bind your sons to exileTo serve your captives\u2019 need;To wait in heavy harnessOn fluttered folk and wild \u2014Your new-caught, sullen peoples,Half devil and half child. Kim (1900): This is the story about an Irish vagabond orphan who is taken up by the British secret service and conscripted into the Great Game of repelling Russian influence in the Himalayas. Kim is a book weaving together Buddhism and espionage, the colourful life of the bazaar and the Grand Trunk Road. 2. Up The Country (1876)by Emily Eden Emily Eden was the sister of George Auckland, Governor General.Her travels across northern India provide a seemingly innocent and remarkably acute commentary on life at the top but also a contrite record of her brother\u2019s disastrous policy in Afghanistan. 3. Curry and Rice(1860) by George Francklin Atkinson Captain Atkinson describes with a delicious wry touch the ramshackle routine in the backwoods of British India in the 1850s: the innocent young subaltern, the disillusioned old major with his Indian family, the mangy pack of hounds they hunt with and the even mangier cattle in the bazaar, the cigar-chomping padre, and the servants fussing around their sweating masters. 4. Writings of Jim Corbett (very essential) The legendary Jim Corbett became famous first for killing the man-eating leopards and tigers who were preying on villagers in the hills of northern India. Later on became equally famous for his efforts to conserve their habitat and the national tiger reserve is today called Jim Corbett Park. This enthralling account of big-game hunting can safely be enjoyed because it is about taking life only in order to preserve it. 5.

A magnificent piece of work describing India's transition from a colony to an independent nation and its journey henceforward. One of the best Historical Fiction ever written.  2) A House for Mr. Biswas by V.S Naipaul: The most memorable book by a Nobel prize winner deserves a place in this list. It is seldom that the book's central character goes suffers tribulations like Mohun Biswasand the author is capable of \"not adapting\" a serious tone. Even the central character's death was unable to bring in an ounce of sympathy in this comic masterpiece . And it gets increasingly tough if the character is based on your own father. V. S. Naipaul's restraint is what makes him one of the Grand Daddies of English Literature and this novel one of the greatest novels erver written.  3) God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy: Small things affect and change people, shaping them into what they are and how they behave. The book revolves around this central theme is truly one of the most insightful book on why someone behaves the way he/she does.  4) The Hungry Tide by Amitav Ghosh: Amitav Ghosh's ability to delineate a distant, secluded and an often forlorn culture/land is on a level of its own. \"The Hungry Tide\" is the epitome of this genius.Though a trite story its complex characters with a totally contrasting set of ethics and goals,  evocative narratives set across in the wild, dangerous and beautiful Sundarbans ensures that it has all the ingredients  for being a page-turner. It provides some great insights into the life of the locals and certain discernment of how your surroundings will affect your moral boundary that tells you of right and wrong.  5) The Great Indian Novel by Shashi Tharoor: When a coveted Political Science intellectual decides that he is going to write a political satire the story of one of the most influential, tumultuous, enthralling and massive political movement (Indian Independence Struggle) in history of world and recast into the country's greatest epic, The Mahabharata, it really does not get better than that. Sprinkled with clever puns through out it is a must read for anyone with political or historical leanings.  Honourable mentions:1)A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth (Easily as good as any of the above)2)The Company of Women by Khushwant Singh3)5 Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat: I understand that this author is usually derided for his skill with the pen and most of his Novels are not exactly masterpieces but this one was a page-turner. His style was fresh, the characters interesting and the story was exciting. Sources: Wikipedia ",

Ayyan works at the Institute of Theory and Research as a personal assistant. His responsibility is to answer private phone calls and read confidential letters. Acharya is the head astronomer at the institute, and spends a great deal of time researching the actual reason behind the Universe, exploring the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Ayyan\u2019s only desire is to bring joy to the lives of his wife and their ten year old son. He then begins to spin the yarn that his son, who is partially deaf, is a genius, which captivates nearly the entire nation.Acharya\u2019s belief is that the Big Bang Theory is a proposition about the Universe\u2019s existence by the West. He argues that the Vatican wanted to have some sort of plot that staged the creation of the Universe and the Big Bang Theory is the ideal one they chose. He goes on to explain his proposition, which is that the Universe could be a giant device that is capable of manufacturing pieces of life. Acharya gears himself towards launching a balloon into outer space, as he believes that these pieces may be floating around in the upper atmosphere.The time comes when Acharya meets with a young astrobiologist named Oparna Goshmaulik, who poses a threat to Acharya\u2019s reputation and the myth surrounding Ayyan\u2019s son. While extremely good at her work, Oparna plays the role of a seductress, carrying on an illicit affair with Acharya, who slowly shifts back into his life as a married man. What follows next is a series of engrossing events that eventually bring about a positive change in the relationships between the characters in the book.  ",

            "answer_text": "Although technically it's a collection of 20 short stories, still its a compelling read. The book follows the migration of Aryans, over the course of time, from the bank of Volga river to the bank of Ganga. The 20 stories, though unrelated to each other, are arranged in accordance with movement of Aryans.  Written by the original Vagabond of Hindi Literature, MahaPandit Rahul Sankrityayan, Volga se Ganga is now considered a classic in history of Indian LiteratureFrom Wikipedia:\"Volga Se Ganga is about the history of Indo\u2013European people who were later known as the Aryans. The 20 stories are woven over a time span of 8000 years and a distance of about 10,000 km. This is a very good attempt at freeing our brains of the clutches of space and time. The first story Nisha is about cavemen living in Siberia about 6000 BC. The society or its precursor at that time was matriarchal and so the story is named after the leader of the family 'Nisha'. Although all the 20 stories are independent and equally enjoyable in their own right, the sequence in which they are arranged nevertheless serves a very important purpose. It is an indispensable aid to anyone who has been baffled by discontinuities in the evolution of societies and their cultures. Here one can find a gradual transformation from a matriarchal society (the first two stories) to a patriarchal one (the rest), a gradual change from freedom to slavery, from acceptance of slavery to its loathing and the likes. If we are to believe Sankrityayan then an apprehension for technological advancement is nothing new. People were wary of the newly better armament which was fast replacing the older stone equipment (Fourth story \u2013 Puruhoot (Tajikistan 2500BC.)). The same story tells us how an arms race was started during that period and how southerners amassed great wealth at the expense of the northerners. The sixth story Angira (Taxila 1800 BC) is about a man who wants to save the Aryan race from losing itself to other races by teaching about their culture (precursor toVedic Rishis). The eighth story (Pravahan (700 BC. Panchal, U.P.). is about the upper class manipulating religion for their own vested interests and conspiring to keep people in dark for at least 2000 years). One can see how easily and frequently the Indians, the mid easterners and the Greeks mingled with each other in the times of Chanakya and Alexander by reading the tenth storyNagdatt about a philosopher classmate of Chanakya who travels to Greece and learns how Athens fell to Macedonia. The eleventh story (Prabha, 50 AD) is about the famous (also the first Indian) dramatist Ashwaghosh, who adopted the Greek art of drama into Indian culture in a very beautiful and authentic way, and his inspiration. Baba Noordeen (1300), the 15th story is about the rise of Sufism. The seventeenth story Rekha Bhagat (1800 is about the barbarous rule of the East India company and the anarchy it brought to India. The last story (Sumer, 1942) is about a man who goes on to fight the Japanese because he wants Soviet Russia to triumph, for this nation (i.e., the Communist Party) is the only hope left for humanity.\" ",

Having said that I have read enough to make my top ten list of them in no particular order.  The Terrorist - Juggi Bhasin: Edge of the seats, pant wetting thrills and the definition of a page turner. Bunker 13 - Anirudha Bahl: Published in early 2000 if I recall correctly and a proper good read. I read the case of exploding mangoes much, much later but I was reminded of Bunker 13 when I read it. Not sure who wrote what first but certainly a good read. Serious Men - Manu Joseph: It was funny and had those deep insights on the human psyche which lets you ruminate while you pursue the story. The Great Indian Novel - Shashi Tharoor: Masterclass in writing and appreciating satire, history and mythology. We are like that only - Rama Bijapurkar: Gives an understanding of how the emancipated Indian consumer thinks and behaves. Also gives you a lens to introspect your own buying/purchase behavior. Dongri to Dubai - Hussain Zaidi: Who doesn't love mafia stories? Especially when they are based on true living, breathing characters. Six Suspects - Vikas Swarup: The structure and formulation of the plot alone is worthy of a separate book. Swami and Friends - RK Narayan: Nostalgia galore!The Whole Byomkesh Series: Sherlock can suck it! Byomkesh and Ajit were the original intellectual sex symbols.  Sacred Games - Vikram Chandra: A lot of people take to this book like a regular whodunit. But it is to be consumed like a boat ride along a frustratingly long meandering river.I find that a lot of the regulars like English August, Namesake, Sea of Poppies to be highly over-rated to my bollywoodized sense and sensibilities.

They all tampered with the laws that lay down who should be loved and how. And how much.\" Goodreads: The God of Small Things 2. The Great Indian Novel by Shashi Tharoor  In this award-winning, internationally acclaimed novel, Tharoor has masterfully recast the 2,000 year-old epic, The Mahabharata, with fictional but highly recognizable events and characters from twentieth-century Indian politics. Chronicling the Indian struggle for freedom and independence from Great Britain, Tharoor directs his hilarious satire as much against Indian foibles as the bumbling of the British rulers Goodreads : The Great Indian Novel 3. The Hungry Tide by Amitav Ghosh  Off the easternmost corner of India, in the Bay of Bengal, lies the immense labyrinth of tiny islands known as the Sundarbans, where settlers live in fear of drowning tides and man-eating tigers. Piya Roy, a young American marine biologist of Indian descent, arrives in this lush, treacherous landscape in search of a rare species of river dolphin and enlists the aid of a local fisherman and a translator. Together the three of them launch into the elaborate backwaters, drawn unawares into the powerful political undercurrents of this isolated corner of the world that exact a personal toll as fierce as the tides. Goodreads : The Hungry Tide 4. Malgudi Days by RK Narayan  Introducing this collection of stories, R. K. Narayan describes how in India 'the writer has only to look out of the window to pick up a character and thereby a story'. Malgudi Days is the marvellous result. Here Narayan portrays an astrologer, a snake-charmer, a postman, a vendor of pies and chappatis -- all kinds of people, drawn in full colour and endearing domestic detail. And under his magician's touch the whole imaginary city of Malgudi springs to life, revealing the essence of India and of human experience. GoodReads: Malgudi Days 5. The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga  The white tiger of this novel is Balram Halwai, a poor Indian villager whose great ambition leads him to the zenith of Indian business culture, the world of the Bangalore entrepreneur. On the occasion of the president of China\u2019s impending trip to Bangalore, Balram writes a letter to him describing his transformation and his experience as driver and servant to a wealthy Indian family, which he thinks exemplifies the contradictions and complications of Indian society.

            "answer_text": "This man has to be one of the most influential Indian story tellers :  R.K. NarayanAn astute observer of human relations and a master story teller, he is definitely one of the leading figures of early Indian literature in English. He is famous for his lucid style and the idyllic settings of his novels. I present to you, two of his must read works :  The book deals with the naivete, wonder and mischief of ten year old Swaminathan. It is set in the idyllic fictional town of Malgudi and is quite nostalgic as it is reminiscent of the simple and carefree world, we all enjoyed as children and the one which the present day generation is devoid of. One can easily step into the boots of young Swami, as he and his friends, Rajam and Mani embark on several adventures.  (An image of Swami from the famous, Malgudi Days serial, directed by Shankar Nag.)Through his eyes, the reader gets to peek into the pre-independence days of South India. On the outset, this may seem like a simple story, but underneath, it is representative of a myriad of the feelings and emotions of Indians, born and brought up under the British Colonial Raj. To quote from a very good review by Harishankar : It is the story of a generation of Indians who are born and brought up  in the shadow of the British colonial Raj and who inherit the confusions  of the cultural and social conflict. This is best seen where Swami is seen alternatively admiring and envying Rajam: the rich boy who walks to  school dressed like a 'European'. Swami is caught between two worlds as  represented by Mani and Rajam. Rajam who stands for all that is posh  and urbane, smooth and unemotional, well educated yet hard and ruthless  in a way. The other end is Mani who is rough, untamed, naive, emotional  and yet loyal. The masterly irony is seen because these two characters  not only meet but (in Swami's eyes) they also apparently get along well. A highly readable novel that can be read on all levels. A must-read. Another of my favorite novels from the same author :   This book deals with transformation of an individual from a savage to a sage. R.K.Narayan masterfully carves out a beautiful sculpture out of the emotions and aspirations of a nondescript guide and dishes out a moving story marking his transformation from a caterpillar to a butterfly. Another must-read. ",

It's very rare that we get a chance to read books that leave a humongous impact on us.I left Spell-Bounded , Wondered how deep he thought and paid attention to each and every detail  to create a novel like this.  \u2018The IMMORTALS OF MELUHA\u2019 , the first book of the Shiva trilogy is a No 1 National Bestseller, having sold over 100,000 copies since its launch in March, 2010. The story is narrated extremely well and way the characters are crafted is simply magical . One of the masterpiece of work by the author. He created a story around one of the most revered gods in Hindu mythology - Lord Shiva, who is portrayed as a simple human being.The mythological \u2013 historical \u2013 adventure \u2013 fiction series is all but immortalized as one of the trend changers amongst Indian books and Indian publishing as a whole. The series is creative, out-of-the-box and very much Indian. That exactly could be the reason why Amish is the latest Rockstar of Indian writing in English.  The book begins with introducing Shiva, who has been portrayed as a Tibetan Barbarian hailing from the warrior tribe (known in the book as the Gunas). He arrives in the fictional city of Meluha on the request of  King Daksha, whose land has been faced by terrorist attacks from the Chandravanshi tribe which he believes has allied with the Nagas \u2013 considered a lowly race - anyone from Meluha with a physical deformity is sent to be a Naga. While in Meluha, Shiva is recognized as the Neelkanth \u2013 an incarnation of the Mahadev, after he drinks the Somras \u2013 a healing potion, which makes his throat turns blue. Then follows the love story of Sati, daughter of King Daksha, and Shiva, which is undoubtedly one of my favorite parts in the entire series. Sati is a \u2018Vikarma\u2019 \u2013 an untouchable \u2013 and when she rejects Shiva\u2019s advances, he challenges the law of Vikrama. In the book the word denotes an \u2018untouchable\u2019 who has to suffer in the present life due to the actions performed in the previous life. Amish Tripathi\u2019s trilogy on Lord Shiva consists of three books, which have been released gradually over the past three years: \u2018The Immortals of Meluha\u2019, \u2018The Secret of the Nagas\u2019, and the much anticipated March-released finale, \u2018The Oath of the Vayuputras\u2019. In the second book the \u2018Secret of the Nagas\u2019, Shiva plays the role of being the savior who has left his homeland to fight evil. He and Sati are happily married. Along this path, Shiva learns that the Nagas are not evil, and that he had misjudged. The story explains how he realizes that metaphorically, a book cannot be judged by its cover. The cover of the book shows Shiva holding a snake which symbolizes evil, which he thought the Nagas represented.    Evil is finally revealed in the third book, \u2018The Oath of the Vayuputras\u2019.   Shiva takes it upon himself to fight against the fiercest of warriors, thereby leading the people away from what they believed to be good. And then, well, you can guess how it all ends!! ",

Kallakuri The scenario of Indian Writing has changed dramatically ever since the advent of authors like Chetan Bhagat, Arvind Adiga, Arundhati Roy,etc. However, Ashok Banker's Ramayana Series and Amish Tripathi's Shiva Trilogy has changed the stream of Indian Literary Genre.These books have been sold in millions.

            "answer_text": "A more contemporary answer, both books by Karan Bajaj. Keep off the Grass: This book has been on bestseller lists in India since its release in 2008. The book was a semi-finalist for the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award and shortlisted for the Indiaplaza Golden Quill Award, among other honors.     The story is about a psychedelic road trip of a 25-year-old Yale graduate through the length and breadth of India. The journey is made by a brilliant youngster named Samrat, born to immigrant parents in the U.S. who decides to go out in search of his roots. Along the way Samrat, the protagonist, ends up in prison for possession of marijuana, develops a drug addiction, meditates in the foothills of the Himalayas, has a one-night stand with a hippie in Dharamsala and meets flesh-eating Aghoree saints on the banks of Varanasi. I loved his second book too, Johnny Gone Down : This book has more action packed into it than a Die Hard film on steroids!   The novel is about the bizarre, almost surreal series of events that transform an Ivy League MIT graduate into first a genocide survivor, then a Buddhist monk, a drug lord, a homeless accountant, a software mogul, and a deadly game fighter over a period of twenty years.

            "answer_text": "I can not read Hindi very well, and I have not read too many English novels written by Indian authors, but here is my list from the books that I read - in no particular order Malgudi Days - RK Narayan It is a collection of short stories - each of which deftly describes an aspect of life in a small Indian town of 1940s ... One of the Indian classics, I think this book is extremely entertaining, and is an all time favourtie of mine.    Volga se Ganga - Rahul Sankrityayan Theists may well be offended by this novel, but I believe people should read this. (After all, respecting others opinion is an important part of growing up) It is a narration of the 'pre-history' of the Aryan race. Through the story of individuals Rahul Sankrityayan has wonderfully illustrated the soceital conditions and power equations of different periods in history upto the time the Aryan race settled in the Sindhu region and starting ruling over most of North India.   5.Someone - Chetan Bhagat or Immortals of Meluha - Amish Tripathi Disclaimer - This entire suggestion is biased by my personal dislike of a lot of books. That makes me club actually a very wide range of books under a single 'genre'. But you asked for an opinion, and am providing one. So try not being biased by my bias :-P I quite liked the first book of the Shiva Triology (The Immortals of Meluha by Amish Tripathi). So if you like my other suggestions, you should probably read that. But that is one of the very few 'modern Indian English novels' I liked. I really dislike Chetain Bhagat (and almost all 'modern' Indian authors writing in English for that matter). But many people really enjoy the genre, and it is stupidity to not try a genre. This is one of my least-disliked books from the genre and much more representative of the genre than The Immortals of Meluha. If you like any of these books, you should probably choose 5 (or at least 2) from Top 50 Indian English Novels(09-12)- TM List. If you like them, go on and read more :-)       The Namesake - Jhumpa Lahiri This novel captures the conflict of cultures many second generation immigrants face - on one side their parents expect them to hold on to their Indian root, on the other hand, their social and cultural environment is very disctinct from what their parents grew up in. Am not making a very good job to describing this book, so am copying from Wikipedia - Moving between events in Calcutta, Boston, and New York City, the novel examines the nuances involved with being caught between two conflicting cultures with highly distinct religious, social, and ideological differences.   If you like this novel, I think you should read the list here ::  Top 5 books by Indian writers in English you must read  Room on the Roof - Ruskin Bond Well I atleast consider Ruskin Bond an Indian - after all he spent his entire life here. If you do not, well read this all the same :-)  This is the story of an orphaned British boy - Rusty, with an Indian heart and strict British foster parents. It is one of the best Ruskin Bond I have ever read.    ",

            "answer_text": "Nice question. I love reading Indian fiction, and there are quite a few authors who are my favorites: Rohinton Mistry, Salman Rushdie, Timeri Murari, David Davidar to name some. But there's one book that just takes the cake: It just has to be \u2018The Illicit Happiness of Other People\u2019 by Manu Joseph.  The story revolves around the happenings in a Malayali Catholic household in Madras of the \u201890s, soon after the eldest son inexplicably commits suicide. The tale then records the journey of the father (a once famous writer, who has now succumbed to the pull of the liquor bottle, transforming into a social outcast), who wishes to find out why exactly his son did what he did. The book is full of delectable quirky anecdotes that lay in plain sight the many hypocrisies of a middle-class community. Sample some of these lines: \u201cThe Boy will not be a failure. Mythili knows.She has seen the generations before.The boy will make it. As his father has said,he does not have the option of failure.He will crack atleast one entrance exam,and he will one day have a nice house in a suburb of San Francisco,or in a suburb of a suburb of San Francisco.He will find a cute Tamil Brahmin wife and make her produce two sweet children.He will drive a Toyota Corolla to work.And there,in the conference room of his office,he will tell his small team,with his hands stretched wide in a managerial way,'We must think out of the box\u201d. What a brazen mocking of something we consider the norm! And more: \u201cThat breaks Ousep\u2019s heart. To imagine the eternal boredom of his child. He wishes here to be no eternity, he wishes that even for his foes.\u201d There is a whole slew of one-of-a-kind incidents, that one might find weird, astonishing even. But it\u2019s this tone that makes the book a huge success. In the end, the reader learns that the story has little to do about the death as such, but endeavors to unravel a while lot more. Read the book for more. \u201cIn this world, it is very hard to escape happiness.\u201d \u2013 Unni Chacko\u201d . Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "The Kama Sutra by Vatsayana   Contrary to popular perception, this ancient text is not just a manual of sexual positions. It is, in fact, the most comprehensive didactic discourse on the third Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha [Ultimate Goal of Life], namely Kama [Aesthetic and Erotic Pleasure]. The reason I adjudge this text as \"the best novels/books of all time by an Indian author\" is not rooted in its innate popularity around the globe, nor do I claim that this book has the highest literary quality or is the most exulted form of art. But I do believe that this book has salvaged the concept of sexual congress from the perceived quagmires of sin and exulted it to the pedestal of art, exposing the literary quality of the act itself and thus making it one of the most popular routes of attaining a virtuous life as dictated by Hindu Philosophy.  Of course, Dharma (Virtue as Duty) and Artha (Monetary Prosperity) usually take precedence over Kama as Purusarthas. Therefore they have been treated more reverently and most texts from the ancient Hindu world deal with them. However, there is a sense of \"duty\" attached with both of these goals and \"duty\" has never been intrinsically welcome to the common man. Kama is, therefore, more appealing. It resonates with man's desire for Desire, it brings the pleasure of Pleasure and leads to the bliss of Bliss. And so, it is the common man's champion virtue. If anything, India is entirely composed of common folk and any treatise that assists the Indian common folk in the pursuit of their champion virtue is quite simply the best book that I would vote for.

So what's so special about it, let's have a look: The way every scene is described whether it be love scene, war scene and introductory scene of a person(especially Sati), it appears to be realistic. You automatically start depicting that and the picture for that starts building in your mind.Most importantly the language is not that much difficult to understand, so don't worry about that.There is hell a lot of characters, but no need to worry again. The description of each character is provided initially in the book, so whenever you seem to be lost have a look and conitnue reading this brilliant piece of work.If you are a type of suspense lover guy, then these books are filled with it. You are also gonna love the style of unfolding the suspenses.The core message delivered by these books: What we think is our greatest good will eventually become our greatest bad, and vice versa is again another reason.Even Shashi Tharoor can't stop praising the work of Amish.

PLOT: The story revolves around a lonely, dejected wife,ROSIE who has a passion for dance ,of a Workaholic archaeologist husband,MARCO and a happy guide RAJU. Neglected by her husband, Rosie finds comfort in arms of Raju who in turn motivates her to pursue her passion. Over a period of time when Rosie becomes successful, Raju begins to manage her performances but becomes greedy and and tries to accumulate more wealth for himself through her. However, he gets arrested for the forgery case and gets two years sentence. After completing the sentence, He is mistaken to be a SADHU, who would solve the famine problems of the village, and starts to enjoy luxuries provided to him by innocent and naive villagers. However, when the famine doesn\u2019t end, he is asked to keep fast in order to make it rain. Ultimately, whether he dies or not, whether it rains or not, has not been answered in the novel. But the circle of life and changes in human nature, over a period of time (i.e. from simplicity to greed to generosity and again back to simplicity ), has been beautifully explained. It\u2019s about a woman( reflecting a typical Indian woman) who wants to create her own identity but unable to do so because of the modern hypocritical society and as soon as she gets the necessary support, achieves the pinnacles of success. It\u2019s about a passionate lover, who lets his greed and insecurities to come in middle his love and ultimately ends up destroying himself. It\u2019s about an apathetic, cold husband who neglects his wife and considers her like a piece of furniture. In short, It\u2019s about complexities of human-life, behavior and circle of life. How a person gets back to same place from where he once started? How a person in-spite of owning everything, ends up with nothing? ",

Even with my limited acquaintance with Kannada literature , I could safely say that each one of the following books have been one-of-its kind and stands majestically amidst other excellent works that have been produced in Kannada .  Mr. D. V. G's Mankuthimmana Kagga - A major literary achievement , which is widely regarded as \"Bhagavad Gita in Kannada\"  for its philosophical overtone , yet noted for its simple way of narration with vivid illustrations , that could be even well understood by common people . More importantly, just like this fantastic work, the author's was also a life worth emulating .  Dr. Kuvempu's Sri Ramayana Darshanam - Through \"Sri Ramayana Darshanam\" , Mr. Kuvempu gave an altogether new dimension to the \"epic\" genre of literature . This magnum-opus based on the Hindu epic \"Ramayana\" is not just another version of Valmiki's story . Instead , Kuvempu's work amounts to an interpretative re-creation of the incidents, the characters and the philosophical, moral and spiritual ideas enshrined in Ramayana . Here , \"Darshanam\" in the title refers to the writer's \"Vision\" or his \" Realization\" .    Dr. K. Shivaram Karanth's \"Mookajjiya KanasugaLu\" ( The title literally translates to \"Dreams of the silent granny\" ) . This Avant-garde literary work with an abstract-philosophical theme is quite noted for Mr. Karanth's innovativeness and maturity in penning the character of mystified granny, the main female protagonist, who is quite contrary to the \"stereotypical grandma\". In the novel, through this astonishing granny, Mr. Karanth makes a bold attempt in unravelling the truth, criticizing the widely-accepted notions pertaining to many issues that are as subtle as - origin of the universe , the existence of some mysterious force, tragedies of human civilization, the adversities of casteism et cetera. It would be ungrateful of me , if I don't recollect the positive impacts which the novel had on me when I finished reading it .      Dr. Masti's historic novels - Chikka Virarajendra and Chennabasava Nayaka . If the former is based on the last ruler of Kodagu district,  the latter is about the last king among Nayakas of Shimoga. Both of these novels are quite remembered for the author's literary prowess. The prolific author was popularly referred to as \"Maasti Kannadada Aasti\" which means \"Maasti is indeed Kannada's Treasure\" .  Also, many other works of Dr. A. N. Krishna Rao (ANaKru),  Mr. T. R. Subba Rao ( TaRaSu) , Dr. S. L. Bhyrappa are also immensely popular . ",

            "answer_text": "The following books are a must read- A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry- This book is set during the emergency that was declared in India during the late 1900s. It traces the story of two poor tailors who come into the city to try their luck in earning money. They stay with a parsi widow who has recently lost her husband. She also boards her friend\u2019s son who has come to the city for college. The story revolves around these four characters and their lives and how slowly they become more of a family than blood could ever make them. The story also subtly shows how most government policies are made without taking into consideration the common man\u2019s plight. This book teaches many things and is sure to move your heart;even make you cry.The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri\u2014 This story is about an Indian family who migrates to the USA. It is about their life there and about the changes that they have to face. It also shows the differences in teenage lives and the loneliness that does come from having no relatives there. It shows that the grass may not always be greener on the other side and that happiness and satisfaction are subjective.Pather Panchali (Song of the road) by Bhibhutibhushan Bandhophadhyay\u2014 This book has been immortalised forever by Satyajit Ray in his Apu Trilogy. It is a story about a a poor family who live in the quiet village of Nishchindipur. It is a moving take about poverty and it's hardships. It beautifully portrays human nature and the simple innocence of children. It is a masterpiece.Do and Die by Mannini Chatterjee- This is a nonfictional account of the less known Chittagong uprising that took place in 1930-1934. It captures the essence of the Indian freedom movement and the contributions of many unsung heroes who are not named in our history books.The village by the sea by Anita Deasai- A heart rendering tale about a fisherman and his family that again traces human lives and hardships faced in poverty.Malgudi Days by RK Narayanan\u2014 A series of tales that will capture the hearts of any age group and can be read any number of times!The Adventures of Feluda by Satyajit Ray \u2014 A series of gripping mysteries that echo Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. These mysteries are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and heart racing!Wise and Otherwise by Sudha Murthy- A series of short inspiring tales that can be read anytime and in any order. They carry wisdom and guidance when you need it.All these books are in English or have English translations. These books show the talent that Indian authors really possess- bringing out human nature at its best and worst. I owe these books much of the wisdom I have gained and for getting to know my country for what it really is and appreciating it. ",

There are scores of Indian novels you must read to appreciate the talent back home. I\u2019ll start the list with the name i believe is the best in fictions. OV Vijayan is the best Indian writer i have read till date. If you can take his style of writing i.e. dark fiction, believe me nothing else will excite you ever. Few of his works include Legends of Khasak, Saga of Dharmapuri.Arundhati Roy, even with her solo novel God of Small Things, is class apart. Roy's other works are non\u2014fictions, which are equally interesting. They include Broken Republic, Walking with the Comrades.Bhalchandra Nemade's Cocoon, a translation of his original novel in Marathi, is plain wonderful. Cocoon is a must read.Rahul Sankrityayan is a name indian's should be proud of. A wanderer, Sankrityayan has penned one of the best travelogues. Volga se Ganga Tak is his magnum opus.Upmanyu Chatterjee is another famous name in the indian writers circuit. His English, August is a must read.Abid Surti, though an unheard name, has written several riveting novels in regional language. Sufi, In the Name of Ram are his famous books.I ll also mention the name of some wonderful authors whose works are must reads. Ramchand GuhaAmitav GhoshRamdhari Singh 'Dinkar'Dharamveer BharatiIsmat ChugtaiSadaat Hasan 'Manto'Chitra SubramaniumHope these are enough names to start with. ",

So, I decided to mention the books that were written by the Indian authors and are a must read. I have cherished their writing and the content. 1. A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth  2. English, August: An Indian Story by Upamanyu Chatterjee  3. The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy  4. The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai  5. Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri  6. The White tiger by Aravind Adiga  Yeah it's not the cover of his book . 7. The Blue Umbrella by Ruskin Bond  It's literally blue umbrella :) 8. The Palace Of Illusions by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni  9. The Great Indian Novel, Shashi Tharoor  10. Maximum City, by Suketu Mehta  Well, I\u2019d agree that there are many more books that could feature in this list. These are the books that are best, according to me.

            "answer_text": "It seems that no one has mentioned any Bengali novels so far although Bengali literature is among the most prolific in India if not in the world in producing novels. They are widely read, extremely popular, have been translated into many languages and inspired scores of Indian movies. I will mention a few of them.  1. Anandamathh- Bankim Chandra     One of the most controversial and influential novels in not only Bengal but the entire country. It is a novel about the Sanyasi rebellion against the British written in the 19th century. It provided the first intellectual background to fuse Hindu religious imagery into the political movement for freedom. The concept of Bharatmata was first envisaged in this book. The slogan Vande Mataram also comes from this book. It inspired the Swadeshi movement, it is even fair to say that it gave birth to it. 2. Srikanto- Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay Srikanto is a massive novel about the life of a middle class Bengali boy born in rural Bengal from his childhood to his adult life. Perhaps no other novel depicts the rural life of Bengal as completely as this.    It has inspired many Bengali movies and stories for countless movies in other languages. 3. Pather Panchali and Aparajito- Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay The movie trilogy which has immortalized Stayajit Ray and is widely considered as one of the most important work in world cinema ever is inspired from these two novels which were sequels and guess what? Satyajit Ray can only claim to have done justice to it. Yes the novel is so good.      The story depicts the life of Apu who is a boy born to a poor Brahmin family in rural Bengal and his epic struggle throughout his life amid monumental tragedies as he grows up. It is a story of the triumph of life over death. Here is the last scene from the Apu Trilogy of Satyajit Ray. Apu is visiting his orphaned son with whom he had no contacts after his birth as the boy's mother (Apu's wife) died during childbirth and Apu has had grudged the boy since then. The boy does not know that Apu is his father.    4. Putulnacher Itikothha- Manik Bandopadhyay. Manik is widely considered one of the 6 literary greats of Bengal. The others being Bankimchandra, Sarat Chandra, Rabindranath Tagore, Tarashankar and Bibhutibhushon Bandyopadhyay.    It is a magnum opus depicting the lives of peasants in rural Bengal amid the Tebhaga movement of 1930's. It played a great role in politicizing the middle class of Calcutta. It is a historical account of life of rural Bengal during the first half of 20th century. 5. Ganadevata-Tarashankar Another great novel on rural Bengal and how the landed class exploited the poor in Bengal. This is set in post independence period and therefore shows how the landed class enjoyed political patronage and covered their dirty business using political might. 6. Hatey Bajare- Banaful Another wonderful novel on the struggle of an educated middle class Bengali trying to fight against religious malpractices and various social stigma in rural Bengal. It has been adopted into an award winning Bengali film. Banaful has many other stories which have been adopted in to national award winning Hindi movies like Bhuvan Shome and Vikram Pandit. ",

            "answer_text": "1. A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth  \u200bImage SourceWhy read it? This is a story of ordinary people set in post- independence Indian background, who are looking for a suitable boy for Lata\u2019s marriage. Lata is 19 and she believes in falling in love first. There\u2019s not only the pursuit of marriage and happiness but heartache and disappointment, which is universal. Throughout its sprawling 1474 pages, there was no emotion left unexplored and no character left misunderstood. 2\ufffc. English, August: An Indian Story by Upamanyu Chatterjee  \u200bImage SourceWhy read it? If you have been to any government office or if you\u2019re working there, then this book is a must read. Upamanyu Chatterjee has presented how things work in an Indian office and it\u2019s refreshingly funny. The story revolves around Agastya Sen and how his life changes when he goes to Madna, a small town. The author has also drawn heavily from his own experience in the Indian administrative service to paint a picture of rural India.3. The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy  \u200bImage SourceWhy read it? Roy\u2019s debut novel is a masterpiece. The book pivots around tragedy and hope. The book also explores the full range of human emotion.4. The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai  \u200bImage SourceWhy read it? Despite the humor and wittiness encompassing it, The Inheritance of Loss remains a powerful book written with sheer honesty. Theinner struggles of the characters could not be conveyed any better. Desai has the capacity to place the exact words on the most abstract feelings! The book is unflinchingly honest. My favorite quote from this book is: \u201dSadness was so claustrophobic\u2019.\u201d5. Interpreter of Maladies by Jhumpa Lahiri  \u200bImage SourceWhy read it? The 9 stories present are a smashing success. Lahiri paints the character\u2019s picture so well that you can relate to an old gatekeeper or a wife feeling lonely and disoriented in a new and unfamiliar home and culture or the young college grad who gets into an affair with a married man. Lahiri\u2019s main characters are all always flawed, but what makes them stand out is how familiarly human they are.6. The White tiger by Aravind Adiga  \u200bImage SourceWhy read it? The novel examines issues of religion, caste, loyalty, corruption and poverty in India. The story revolves around Balram, who worked his way out from his low social caste and how he became successful and how he overcame all the social obstacles.7. The Blue Umbrella by Ruskin Bond  \u200bImage SourceWhy read it? It is set in the hills of Garhwal and captures the life of villagers who portray heroic characters. Basically, it captures the life in a village.8. The Palace Of Illusions by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni  \u200bImage SourceWhy read it? Banerjee has written the whole story by stepping into Draupadi\u2019s shoes and writing a completely male dominant epic from a female\u2019s point of view. Her description of emotions like insecurity, jealousy, and love are amazing. No doubt this is the best fictional account of the Mahabharat.9. The Great Indian Novel, Shashi Tharoor  \u200bImage SourceWhy read it? In this novel, Tharoor has masterfully recast the Mahabharata. He has compared the political figures of India with the characters of the Mahabharat. It\u2019s basically a retelling of the Indian epic, but it falls in the realm of political satire by drawing parallels with major events in India\u2019s political history during the freedom movement and the post-independence era.

            "answer_text": "I would just mention the names  of some of the most amazing novels by Indian, I have read till now - 1)Premchand -Nirmala and Rang Bhoomi We all have read about Premchand in our school days, but whatever you have imagined is far lesser than the beauty and essence of his writings. Sadly I have read only these two novels till now. He has many more which are much more famous and world known. His novels are based on real life characters, real life settings, same person becomes an evil and a messenger of god at different points of time. He weaves the complexity of our existence, actions and decisions in such a beautiful manner that you will be surprised on the perception and portrayal of the writer. He is the best novelist I have ever read, who could write stories on day to day life yet make it the best you will ever read.  2) Rashmi Bansal - Connect the Dots, Stay Hungry Stay Foolish and I have a dream. These books are based on real life difference makers, presented in a manner that you feel connected to it and imagine yourself to be in her place, interviewing these people, mesmerized by the words of these men/women who have lived life of meaning  and made so many life's better because of them. Awesome books and must read. 3) Amitav Ghosh - The Hungry Tide, The Glass PalaceThe Stories of Amitav Ghosh are not some far fetched reality, they are our very own day to day people, whose life is woven beautifully almost magically to take you to all together different level of understanding. Facets of human nature are depicted in most subtle manner and the setting of novel is almost sure to make you mesmerized and read the book till it ends. Even then you will keep thinking about the characters, the landscape, the story and the end. One awesome writer of today. 4)  Amish Tripathi - Shiva Triology No need to say how beautifully written it is. Again the story is just amazing, and all your thoughts till now and religious stories you have heard till now, take a new face and all together new existence. Amazing and definitely a must read. 5)  Manoj Das-Tiger at TwilightThe way he writes is superb. I read this novel focusing more on the writing than story as it is so very amazing. A very nice novel.   6) Jaya, illustrated retelling of Mahabharata - Devdutt PattanaikHe shows Mahabharata stories with all its forms and interpretations. Nicely written and entertaining read. 7) Swami and Friends - R.K. NarayanWho can forget the beautiful world of Malgudi, it is a treasure of our childhood days as well. Most amazing, innocent and heart-touching stories you can read. 8) Idli, Orchid and Will Power - Vikram KamatA very inspiring book written in a very engaging manner. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's start with authors that you shouldn't bother about though they are very popular - books by Amish and Chetan Bhagat. They will only entertain you but will not enrich you. I believe that books should startle you with language or give you a new perspective on life or make you think. Along with this, they should entertain you. Chetan Bhagat and Amish only do the latter. They are written for young guys who want easy language and spicy stories. Based on the above criteria, here are the ones I would recommend: The Shadow Lines, The Glass Palace, The Hungry Tide, and Dancing in Cambodia by Amitav Ghosh English August by Upamanyu Chatterjee God of small things by Arundhati Roy A Fine Balance and Such a Long Journey by Rohinton Mistry Midnight's Children and The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie A New World by Amit Chaudhuri Anything by Ruskin Bond Do read translated small stories by Rabindranath Tagore There are Indian origin writers such as Pico Iyer and VS Naipaul that are masters of the craft. You can also read Ramchandra Guha and Ashis Nandy for non-fiction on Indian society. Haven't read Shashi Deshpande and Romila Thapar. But Gita Mehta's Karma Cola and A River Sutra are nice. Will add more as I remember ",

Former is a story of two siblings who got separated at an early age and the consequences. R K Narayan's books are one of the finest narratives of the tales of the late sixties of India. But, I will recommend you to read books of Indian languages. India has rich literature - Bengal and Tamil known for its good novellas. Urdu famous for its shayarees. In Kannada, you'll get a bunch of good authors who made Kannada literature as a profound one. Kuvempu, Karantha, Tejaswi, Ananthamurty (list continuous) to list a few. Devanuru Mahadeva, Siddalingyyah have picturised how it feels to grow as an oppressed community. Yashwanth chittal narrated many stories in a manner which is similar to that of Kafka's style. U R Ananthmurty's debut novel Samskara was on the final list of Man Booker award in the year 2014. Vivek Shanubhag's Ghachar Ghochar received a positive review by NYT. I've heard quite about Malayalam literature. Khasakkinde ithihasam, aadu jeevitham etcetera. These books are in my bucket list. ",

            "answer_text": "The Great Indian Novel by Shashi Tharoor    As the author himself claims at the beginning of the book, there is nothing he considers 'great' about the novel, neither is it a typical 'Indian' tale, nor does it follow a standard 'novel style. The title alludes to what the author considers THE Great Indian Novel - The Mahabharata.   The author successfully, and - more often than not - hilariously recasts the characters of the Mahabharata as the political honchos and the who's who of 20th century India.  The modern twist on the tale begins as the 80 year-old Ved Vyas (known as V. V. in his social circles! ), at the advice of his good friend, Brahm, hires as an amanuensis ,the diligent, South Indian, Ganapathi. V.V.'s musings give form the rest of the story - Gandhiji becomes Gangaji, Indira Priyadarshini becomes, Gandhari and Dhritasrashtra's daughter, Priya Duryodhani, as the author superposes mythical tales from the Mahabharatawith historical facts from pre-Independence to newly independent India. Packed full of references and nods to characters and events from the original epic, this is a generations-spanning story, incredibly well-researched by the former UN Under-Secretary General and award-winning author Shashi Tharoor.

Over the following years countless young men, seduced by the romance of the militant, fuelled by feelings of injustice, crossed over the Line of Control to train in Pakistani army camps. Peer was sent off to boarding school in Aligarh to keep out of trouble. He finished college and became a journalist in Delhi. But Kashmir angrier,more violent, more hopeless was never far away. In 2003, the young journalist left his job and returned to his homeland to search out the stories and the people which had haunted him. In Curfewed Night he draws a harrowing portrait of Kashmir and its people. Here are stories of a young man's initiation into a Pakistani training camp; a mother who watches her son forced to hold an exploding bomb; a poet who finds religion when his entire family is killed. Of politicians living in refurbished torture chambers and former militants dreaming of discotheques; of idyllic villages rigged with landmines, temples which have become army bunkers, and ancient sufi shrines decapitated in bomb blasts. And here is finally the old story of the return home and the discovery that there may not be any redemption in it. ",

The Mahabharata is roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined, and four times Ramayana. So you will understand why it is called EPIC. The oldest reference to them dated back to approx. 5th century BCE, but the actual writing is much older than that, dating back to almost 9th century BCE. Literature-wise, there is no match to the grandeur and complexity of Mahabharata. To compare it with Shakespeare would be shaming them (and that is no exaggeration). [Further read: What elements of \u201cMahabharata\u201d make it timeless, and what are the basic lessons we can learn from it?] You can also give a read to K\u0101lid\u0101sa's work, especially \u092e\u0947\u0918\u0926\u0942\u0924\u092e\u094d which is considered to be one of the best works of literature.

            "answer_text": "The Shiva Trilogy by Amish. By far one of the best books I've ever read combining both foreigner and indian authors. This series tells us the story of a common, tribal man named Shiva who existed centuries ago, and goes on to become the Mahadev. He is recognized all over India as the destroyer of evil just because he has a blue throat. The book follows his journey as he goes on to find true evil and eventually destroying all of it. This book has been written in such a way that the youth of the country find parallel with it. It is nothing like those old mythological tales. Shiva here, goes on destroying all of those old-school ways of hindu living including The SATI practice and much more. The three books make Shiva the ideal man for the title of The god of gods, the Mahadev. The story in each step keeps unravelling secrets and keeps readers thrilled and ensures that they reach the end of the book quickly. The story has love, mystery, secrets, war, philosophy all rolled as one with the central character Shiva. Do read it. ",

The way the lush scenery and beauty of living in the mountains has been described, you might just feel like packing your bags and moving to a hill station! :-DAll works by R K Narayangan. Especially Malgudi daysRabindranath Tagore- all his short stories make you realise how different life was in rural Bengal. Plus you get to learn some Bengali too ;)The white tiger- by Arvind Adiga.There is no way to describe this book except that it is nothing like you have ever read before. The crass language used in some parts serves to make it even more Indian! ",

Malgudi Days by R.K Narayan..The book with which I started this wonderful journey, where the author makes you venture through the imaginary world through his beautifully crafted characters.4. Jugaad-Innovation by three Indian Authors... Now the term \"Jugaad\" has been abused enough..but this book is just what the entrepreneurs in India (atleast the one's making a decent attempt at it) should grab right away.5. Imagining India- Nandan Nilekani.. Should I tell you something that interests you in Nilekani's work..I don't think so...6. The White Tiger by Aravind Adiga - Yeah! It won him the Man booker prize..Need I say more? I know a Chetan Bhagat's novel doesn't feature in the list...I think he has to be credited for introducing the youth of India to books rather than frantically swiping their smart phones in their free time. I started off with a R. K Narayan book and followed it with Chetan's!The list doesn't follow any order...and I haven't read many of Indian authors works...you know the list...! ",

The freedom and the quality of life that we have today, much of it we owe to the 10 historical judgements.   5. Shiva Trilogy By Amish Tripathi Because once you are hooked, it's impossible to leave the book(any of them). Facts and fiction merge seamlessly. No matter what religion you adhere to, this book is a must read.   ",

            "answer_text": "Some really nice books listed here. Lately, my eyes caught this one, The Lost Temple. I finished it in a day. I thought it needs to be listed among best books by Indian authors.  It's a fast paced action thriller that combines mythology, archaeology, military technology and nuclear science. The story moves with number of different elements and groups that the author, Vishesh Sharma, has managed to bring together through the story. one can read sample chapter at Author Vishesh - The Lost Temple   The story moves on multiple dimensions and authors displays his command on subjects as diverse as military equipment and ancient Indian temple architecture. There is a high suspense thrill in the story and of course there is a romantic angle that develops as the story moves.  Not many contemporary authors can achieve the kind of flow author has managed to bring in coupled with his knowledge of different subjects. In the age of over analysis it is nice to see someone working on bringing synthesis amongst different subjects \u2013 linking the modern to the ancient. We need many more works that synthesize out thought process rather than break everything for microanalysis. ",

            "answer_text": "Shyam-chi aai in Marathi (Shyam's Mother in English) by - Sane Guruji  What the book is about? Set in the British Raj, this book is an autobiography of social activist Sane Guruji(fondly called Shyam during his childhood) who belonged to a Brahmin family living in Konkan region of Maharashtra.In the book he is narrating his memories to a group of children in an nightly sitting.The central character of this book is Shyam's mother and the kind of enormous influence she has on Shyam's life and upbringing. It involves sticking to one's ideals even though one is neck deep in abject poverty. Why one should read this book ?The narration is flamboyant and involves readers in the setting smoothly. As the story progresses, we come to know the deterioration of Shyam's debt-ridden family. The communication between father and son, mother and son, and siblings is exemplary. It shows if love is present a person's life can be content no matter how poor he is. Achievements:The book was adapted into a movie by none other than Acharya Atre, one of the finest talent in Maharashtra's film and theatre culture.The movie won President's medal as The Best Feature Film award at the first National Awards held in 1954.Over the years this book has made a special spot in Marashtrian households. PS: Munshi Premchand's Godaan is also another brilliantly written book worth mentioning ",

This is a terrific read and gives a glimpse into an unexplored portion of History. Godan (The Gift of a Cow) - by Premchand As language has not been mentioned in the question, I must include this epic book. Even if you are not great at reading Hindi, go read a translation. An absolutely fascinating book about the Indian people. A Flight of Pigeons - by Ruskin Bond This is a fictional account of a British mother daughter duo who are abducted by an Indian mutineer in 1857 because he is smitten by the daughter. Another excellent book which really brings the famous revolt of 1857 to life as seen by common people and civilian Britishers of the time. Bonus: Also made into an excellent film by Shyam Benegal, so you can go watch it after you have finished the book. (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077783/) ",

Both men are happy and settled in their respective lives when they come across a shocking truth. When Venkatesh realises he has a half-brother from his father's extramarital liaison, his world changes. He finds his step-mother out and is pained to see the pitiful condition she is living in. He must make amends for what his father has done but the question that haunts him deep within is if it is really possible to undo everything. Mukesh is in a similar state of agony when he comes to know that he was adopted as a kid. Pushed by impulse, he decides to find his biological mother. But the farther he goes, the more unclear the picture becomes. He must decide towards whom his true love and loyalty lies: the woman whom he called his mother all his life and who raised him or the woman who has given him birth. The two men are bound by the same dilemma and the same complexity of emotions. and it is important for them to find their way back to bring stability in their lives. The core interest of the book is in exploring if it is really possible to come to terms with a reality as blaring and as deceiving as that of Venkatesh and Mukesh. ",

            "answer_text": "Yayati: A Classic Tale of Lust,  by V. S.Khandekar It is one of the most intriguing and fascinating story of Mahabharata.One of the most exciting reads. The story of  King Yayati and his passions, unending desires of lust.A simple story intertwined in the POV of different characters. Characters have to make choices all the time, between what they want and what duty calls, between good and bad, between bad and worse, between ego and devotion, between family and society, between themselves and their partners, between now or later, between ages and eras and everything that comes in between. The most awesome part of the book is the symbolism the author has used to compare this ancient story with the modern times. It opens your mind to a lot of new perspectives. This novel has won the highest literary awards in India - Jnanpith Award & Sahitya Academi Award.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in reading quality Indian literature, and anyone interested in India\u2019s historical literature.

Shyamchi Aai is an autobiography by Sane Guruji. It is hailed as one of the greatest if not the greatest tribute to mother's love in Marathi literature. This book is the story of Sane Guruji and his family. It shows how his family, coming from a wealthy background, became poor and struggled through that period. As the book's title suggests the main character is his mother. It is a story where a mother teaches her kid to stick to their ideals even if they are neck deep in abject poverty. This book is a great story of a mother's love for her child. It was indeed recommended to me by my mother. ",

Its about this person who was once an Ivy League scholar with a promising future at NASA, but now at forty, he is homeless and has gone through an epic journey that sees him become a genocide survivor, then a Buddhist monk, a drug lord, a homeless accountant, a software mogul and a deadly game fighter. I found the writing to be very lucid and beautiful. Also the plot is quite abnormal. The book is really fast paced. It jumps from one terrain to another in very small period of time.But the way it is written, it really makes you think.  What more do you expect from a book ? ",

Not convinced\u2026 try this, take the organisation you work for, analyse and find the \u2018real boss\u2019, you will surely have a \u2018Bheeshma - dedicated righteous person, \u2018Shakuni\u2019 - the cunning management interface etc.Malgudi Days (and many other books) - by R.K.Narayanan - it portrays the lifestyle in South India of those times. But there are a good number of elements that relate to our daily life and characters of today!Wings of Fire (& Ignited Minds) by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Sir - this portrays the dreams, the aspirations of the new generation, yet highlights the aspects in which we need to improve.I also like Sudha Murty\u2019s writing, if you want a little fantasy/ adventure I would suggest the Shiva Trilogy !

It is the Mahabharatha from the viewpoint of Bhimsena(n), the second of the Pandava brothers. What is so brilliant about this book is that it takes all the mythical and fantastic elements and reinterprets them based on reality. Over the course of the book, you realise that - Yudhisthira is a wimp.Dhritarashtra didn't have 100 kids because his wife gave birth to a mass of flesh which was cut into 100 pieces. He had 100 kids because he had sex with (a.k.a. fucked) multiple women in the palace, ranging from the serving maids to the cleaning ladies.Kunti didn't have children because she recited a mantra and invoked a god to give her a child. She had children because she had sex with people other than her husband.Pandu didnt father any children with his wives because he was cursed with death if he did so. He was impotent.Explanations that are much more simple and practical, methinks. Sad part is that this book is not available in English ('Second Turn' was published, but it is out of print now. I heard that the publishers are planning to release another run). If you can read Malayalam, please please read this. You will not regret it. ",

'Swami and Friends\u2019 is also one of his best works.If you are in mythology -Amish's Shiva Trilogy is by far the best mythological fiction.Devdutt Patnaik - fact based retelling of Mahabhara i.e. 'Jaya' and Ramayan i.e. 'Sita' are also good.Ashwin Sanghi's - 'The Rozabal Line' is the one of the most probing book.Arvind Adiga's 'The White Tiger' is one of the best contemporary novel.If you are in Hindi Language -'Kashi ki Assi' by 'Kashinath Singh' is also a good read ( I belong to Varanasi, so I might be a bit biased )'Vijaya' by Saratchandra is one of the classics and so is 'Godan' by Munshi Premchand.There are so many of several others such as, Kushwant Singh - train to Pakistan, Jhumpa Lahiri's - 'The Namesake\u2019 is more popular but I like 'The interpreter of Maladies' (Again I may be biased)Happy reading.",

If you like knowing about lesser written about Indian places, provoking and humorous pieces of fiction then:Ruskin Bond's short stories: His stories are filled with simplicity and warmth of small towns in India. He speaks of nature and of ordinary people in an extraordinary way. It is a reminder of the simpler times and of the wonderful places in the hills. Swami and friends by RK Narayan is very good. A peek a boo into innocence of yesteryears. Young boys, cricket, summers and a fictional place called Malgudi. All the stories reminds one of childhood days.  Iceboys in Bellbottoms by Krishna Shastri Devulapalli. This is a story set in 1970s, Madras. The author brings out the importance of homeschooling and the eccentricity of his family filled with artists. Hilarious. (Reading his second book, Jump Cut now)  If you like to read books that are opaque in nature and instill imagination, then try poetry by poets like AK Ramanujan (speaking of siva), Arun Kolatkar (jejuri) among other good indian poets who merge culture and language. They paint India beautifully in their verses.  Recently, I read: Twentieth Century Poetry Anthology (Telugu). It was a brilliant insight into lives and the religious and political scenario of 40s-90s in Andhra Pradesh. ",

Krishna Key by Ashwin SanghiA fast paced book that takes you on a journey in the present and the past. More like a Dan brown kind. Thoroughly loved reading this and now a fan of Ashwin Sanghi :)  3. Asura by Anand NeelakanthanCompletely different book that narrates Ramayana from Ravana's perspective. Everybody knows what a hero has to say but does anyone think of what the villian had to say. This gives you an interesting insight.   4. Shiva Triology by Amish TripatiOnly thing i will say, you will not be in peace until you finish all the 3 books once you start to read. Beautifully written.   5. Five point someone by Chetan BhagatSometimes or most of the times its not how much you score. The more important is what you are and become once you start learning. A quick read.  ",

Rohinton Mistry deftly handles the change in narrative and shows us a picture of one of the most tumultous periods of India. This one was an out and out winner for me.   ",

Asura, on the other hand, is Ramayna retold where Ravana, with all his arrogance and pride, was only a man who did what he felt was in the best interests of his kin. Anand Neelkanthan, exceeds all creativity and imagination! Both the books are full of twists and turns! It becomes difficult to keep the book down once you start! But then again, that's my opinion.

A novel in which the normal and the abnormal, the ordinary and the extraordinary, illusion and reality, resignation and desire to rub shoulders.The protagonist, Billy Biswas, is a man of extraordinary passions. He has everything going for him - education, wealth, status, travel and a loving wife. Yet his inner world is rocked by a groundswell of discontent. He is consumed by a restlessness which grows steadily...Characterised by great elan and sophistication, the narrative unfolds in quick succession, and would be hard to believe were it not related in such a matter of fact, down to earth manner.' -- Orient Paperbacks Beyond the Last Blue Mountain - A Life of JRD Tata by R.M. LalaA biography of JRD Tata, which gives insights into the life of great man and also presents another aspect of our 'demigod' leaders like Jawahar lal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. India : The Siege Within by M.J. AkbarVery skillfully explores the major issues which India is facing since independence, such as Kashmir issue, naxalism and others. Himalayan Blunder by Brigadier J. DalviA poignant tale by a Brigadier as to the real causes of defeat of India in Indo-China war of 1962. It was banned by Indian government soon after its launch. That should be a reason enough. The Shiva TrilogyGuess i need not say much on this. Although i did not liked the second and third part at all, the overall series carries a beautiful message : 'Excess of anything is bad, event if its elixir of life' ",

The book stays with you long after you turn over the last page, and that in my opinion is the definition of a good book.Its the story of Mahabharata from the eyes of Draupadi. Now the story itself is timeless, but has never been told from the view point of the female protagonist. We all knew the details, but we didn't know her feelings, her desires, her pain, her agony, her secrets. All of it is revealed her and the author has done it in a way that leaves you astounded. A must read! ",

I'm sure that I'm leaving out many equally important works and would be happy to be reminded of them through the lists furnished by others.

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you want to read:        Hindi novels (except point no. 8):            1. Read Premchand, most of his novels depict the bitter truth of Indian social                 customs, prevalent during early 20th century. Complete collection of his                stories can be found in \"Maansarovar (7 volumes)\".            2. Go for Amrita Preetam, most of her novels are inspired by sufferings of                women in Indian patriarchal society. Believe me, some of her stories will                make you cry.            3. Sharatchandra- Basis of most of his novels are romance, love and family                relations and values .

Taslima Nasreen- Islam women plight and Hindu-Muslim riots. \"Lazza\",               \"Chaar Kanyayen\" and \"Ka\".            7.

If you want something more contemporary with mythological references Amish Tripathi\u2019s Meluha series is popular. There is \u2018The prince of Ayodhya\u2019 by Ashok K. Banker, and \u2018Palace of Illusions\u2019 by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. Jhumpa Lahiri is another popular writer. I recently read \u201cEm and the Big Hoom\u201d by Jerry Pinto. \u201cA Fine Balance\u201d by Rohini Mistry also falls under this category. If you want something with more depth there is always Amitav Ghosh and Salman Rushdie. All their books are equally good. And finally, a select group of readers really seem to connect with Chetan Bhagat\u2019s book. ",

I can only imagine what effect it would have on me if I were to ever read the original Malayalam version.I would say that God wrote via this man's pen. It is a simple story about childhood love. But it is also much much more. Right from the beginning, there is a sense of tragedy. But nothing prepares us for the final stab in the heart. Almost all great works ultimately acknowledge that life is absurd. This one does too. Sometimes you are happy and sometimes you suffer. There is no reason for either state. It just is.    ",

When I read it, I found \"Inscrutable Americans\" by Anurag Mathur to be hilarious. But not sure how well it has aged. I loved \"The Beast with Nine Billion Feet\" - a Sci-Fi novel based in future Pune. If you are into historical crime fiction, try \"An Englishman's Cameo\" by Madhulika Liddle. It was decent. ",

This book was originally written by him in Odia called \"Antaranga Bharata\" ( literally, Initimate India) as a collection of short stories of his travel across the country in the later part of 20th century. His works are so brilliant that they transfer you into another world where you need to close your eyes and picture the words written in the book. The Government of India has awarded him with the \"Padma Shri\", India's fourth highest civilian award for his contribution to literature. Also, another prestigious literary fellowship the \"Sahitya Akademi Fellowship\" which is highly regarded among Indian writers. I did not find a hard copy of the book, however the Amazon kindle store has a copy of the same. I loved the book!

Amazingly written book about a Brahmin scholar and the culture in his region.Chemmeen, in Malayalam, by Thazakhi Sivasankara Pillai, one of the most romantic stories ever. Arguably the best in India.Gaban, in Hindi, by Premchand. Actually his Hindi was quite often mixed with Urdu words.Ponniyin Selvan, in Tamil, by Kalki Krishnamurthy. An epic about Rajraja Chola, one of the greatest ever Indian rulersHajar Chaurashir maa, in Bengali, by Mahasweta Devi about a prisoner during the times of Naxal movement at its peakRashmi Rathi, in Hindi, by Ramdhari Singh Dinkar. Though a work of poetry, not prose, I included it coz it is a work that helped catapult Dinkar to the status of National Poet. Obviously the list can go on according to different tastes. Indians have really produced some amazing literary works. ",

Their busy life full of rush and crowded with people yet they carry the feelings of loneliness in their heart. They want to keep going,yet at some place their life stays as still as flamingoes. It is a book which compels you to think differently about life and also lets you enjoy the mesmerising feelings and emotions which it has to offer. ",

It's not that it's mass fiction, just that the style and the plots seem too cliched. I haven't been able to appreciate Amish Tripathi either - that's mainly because of the language & hackneyed approach. I've read Pratik Shah's work recently; this one stands out.  ",

The book is a partition novel and it provides some unique insight into the condition of the country at the time India was divided. The narration is from the perspective of a boy who is born at midnight on 15th August, 1947 and he has unique powers like the other children who were born between 12\u20131 am on 15th August. The book weaves in fantasy and reality seamlessly and you don't know when the real world events end and the fantasy begins. It's a very very good read and captured your imagination quite dexterously. The second is Palace Of Illusions by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. It's The Mahabharata from a woman's point of view and it is a phenomenonal piece of work. Draupadi, in this novel is not a passive pawn in the game played by the Men, she is an active participant and plays her own part with ferocity and determination. ",

The world created by Samit Basu has esoteric creatures from Eastern and Western mythologies, blending together to make a fantastic read. On one hand you have the Vanars,Rakshasas and  Pashans while Dragons,Centaurs, Manticores and the alien Ravians are a good complement. The series is at once a subtle spoof and a classic fantasy racing through a world featuring characters and people from different cultures and mythologies. ",

I would try to encompass what it offers in the following points: 1. Story: No spoilers here, though, I would like to tell that story is not a tribute, not an ode, nothing of the sort, but it is the story of creativity prior to the Neolithic Period (New Stone Age). The adrenaline rushing action sequences, poetic violence, comprehensive philosophy and the scientific definition of religion and God, are plain beauty. As John Keats said, it is a joy forever. 2. Language: I believe the language used in a book should be in synchronization with not just the story, but also the time frame of the story. Since the book is based on ancient Aryavart (India), the language used should have such beauty that it comes out as a character in its own. This book achieved that!! 3. Cover: The cover gives a sense of mysticism. Apt for the story. 4. Readability: The book is a page turner and leaves you wanting for more, in the end. ",

Though now she is residing in CANADA, i can consider her Indian as most of her education was part of her Indian residency ",

A sample punch for you all. \u201cIndia is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.\u201d  And, Sashi Tharoor doesn't need a paragragh in praise, from my side, to manipulate your decision to read this golden piece. More than anything, this novel offers an identity to Indians and when you read with all your gasping, and smothering, you realize that you're living in one the greatest nations of all time - INDIA. I hope the novel slaps you the way it smudged my face. Good luck! ",

The book when first published was considered quite radical. It evoked mixed feelings in me. On one hand, I felt proud that we had some thinkers who were so forward thinking. On the other hand, I felt sad that in a large section of the society, the plot still holds true. ",

            "answer_text": "Books written by Indian authors in English have three problems:1. The dialogues and thoughts of the characters are \"translated\" from their native language to English and often sound absurd in that language.2. The writing mostly panders to a Western audience to whom the wonders of a poor, \"native\" and mysterious country are presented for awestruck consumption. The use of italicised Indian words like samosa, along with a footnote that explains what this is, underscores the nature of the target audience.3.  The experiences of the diaspora, especially in the US, have been done to death already.            I feel the best writing from India is in Indian languages, but there is a very limited readership for these which makes it commercially non-viable.             For the moment we have to suffer novels written as trilogies and sequels which get produced at the rate of one every six months or so by each gifted author!              Dickens and the Bard will surely be turning in their graves. ",

A well written tale, and fairly representative of its kind. 3. Malgudi Days - RK NarayananIt is to books what rk laxman's common man is to cartoons. Simplicity and humor.. One of the best books I've ever come across. There are many other exceptional books. But nothing that makes them stand out in a crowd, or get into a small list.
