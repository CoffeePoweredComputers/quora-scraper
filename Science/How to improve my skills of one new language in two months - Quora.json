            "answer_text": "Many people have often asked the same questions. If you are serious about becoming fluent in the new language,  have a teacher to help and support you in the journey. Since you have an 8-week timeline to achieve this goal to improve the language, you should make time to interact with your teacher who can correct your pronunciation and sentence structure. You might want to consider to join some Facebook study groups to have an accountability partner to study with you.   I speak five languages and recently I had experienced that My Japanese listening comprehension had improved within a week when I spoke Japanese with locals. I could understand them easily and able to respond them in Japanese without translating them. The way to improve your listening comprehension and speaking skills is to use the language and communicate it with the locals or a teacher.   I hope this helps. Feel free to ask me questions, I'd happy to answer them. All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "The best way to learn languages is to put yourself in the suitable environment. This is because you are subconsciously forced to learn the language in order to understand (and humans hate not understanding).For example you can join a language club or do a language course. Or if you are willing to do the extreme, live in the desired country (best way) for a minimum of 1 month! The main idea is for you to interact with others so you can study vocabularies, sentence structure and pronunciation. Try to avoid people speaking the same language unless it is to ask translations/better understanding of the sentence and phrases. Alternatively you can do self-training using online courses as it wouldn't restrict your progress. However this is much slower and your question demands swift action. ",

            "answer_text": "I learned German in a very short period of time, 10 weeks, through an intensive training program at UCSD one summer.  There were six students in the class and one teacher completely fluent in German and English.  We just sat around and talked eight hours a day.  If we couldn't say it in German, we would say it in English and get an immediate translation.  After ten weeks I was very fluent and at ease in the language, and satisfied my college language requirement. ",
