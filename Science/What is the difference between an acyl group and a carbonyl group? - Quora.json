            "answer_text": "A Carbonyl Group is simply a Carbon double-bonded to Oxygen. In this case, the Oxygen is more electronegative than the Carbon so you would then notice a slightly bipolarity state in which the electrons are being drawn slightly more toward the Oxygen. The result of this asymmetry is to create a slightly \u201cneedy\u201d Carbon \u2026 wanting to add more electrons. An Acyl Group is actually just a subset of a Carbonyl Group. In other words, in this case we have both a Carbonyl Group \u2026 and \u2026 an \u201cR\u201d Group, a so-called Alkyl Group, derived from a transformation of an acid of some kind and which can result in any thing from a long Hydrocarbon Chain to just about anything else. So, you have both a C=O and a C-R creating a C=O-R, taking up three bonds in total. The fourth Carbon Bond can also have some attached group but is not included in either the Carbonyl nor the Acyl Group. The Acyl Group is active in many biochemical transformations. ",
