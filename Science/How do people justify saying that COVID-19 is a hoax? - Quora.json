            "answer_text": "Obviously, people don't really think that except for crazy people and trolls and that\u2019s just a straw man like saying that US elections are a hoax because Russia or that hate crimes are a hoax because of people like Jussie Smollett. Many people are correctly pointing out that a lot of reporting of COVID-19 is contradictory, inconsistent, sensationalism, hysteria, exaggerations, anecdotes, rumours, conspiracy theories, fear mongering, propaganda, fabrications, and hearsey. Don't just believe whatever is on the TV or the mess that is social media. Many people are also correctly pointing out that the cases and deaths are officially being over counted. I already wrote about this in extensive detail with official medical and government sources. My aswer is more than adequate but I could have easily made it 100 times longer. Alexander Rose's answer to The USA has 5% of the world\u2019s population, but about 30% of COVID-19 cases, despite being the richest nation on the planet. Where did it go wrong? By the way, there are germs, viruses, microorganisms, pathogens, pollutants, and mycotoxins literally everywhere and it's impossible to not breathe them in. Pollution alone kills nearly 10 million people every year, and everybody has latent infections including any of the following: Herpes, E. coli, tuberculosis (1/3rd of people in the world), staph, Hepatitis B, amebiasis, parasites, flesh eating bacteria, and MRSA, but those are just old news and one us scared of any of those things anymore, so really just like with COVID-19, it's all nothing to worry about and you only get sick if you already have preexisting health problems and conditions. COVID-19 is clearly a rare disease with a very low mortality rate, and it not like ebola, smallpox, rabies, bubonic plague, anthrax, or even HIV, so please stop comparing it to those things ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose I could think like a \u201cflat-Earther\u201d and make an educated guess about this as late as 4/22/2020\u2026 I do have an answer draft that sarcastically claims the Earth is flat, and despite <sarcasm> before and </sarcasm> after the flat-Earth part, I am reluctant to publish it lest it be construed as a serious \u201cflat-Earth\u201d answer and it gets collapsed by downvotes or moderation. So how could I completely explain away COVID-19 even now, through however ridiculous conspiracy theories? (Note: I do not actually believe any of these): The liberal and conservative media are lying to you. They pay hospital workers to claim that they are \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by this \u201cvirus\u201d when in fact everything is going swimmingly in hospitals, with no medical supply shortage. The conservative media fools people incapable of critical thinking, but misleads the left about what the lies are by at least nominally acknowledging this \u201ccoronavirus\u201d while otherwise intentionally bumbling the \u201cexpert recommended\u201d response to keep the public politically divided.The hospitals themselves could be in on this, too. People with apparent \u201cCOVID-19\u201d actually have the original SARS, which there is a vaccine for, but hospitals are forced to assume it\u2019s \u201cCOVID-19\u201d due to government orders, and take excessive quarantine measures. Why not just vaccinate? Because that would ruin the \u201cofficial story\u201d that hospitals are either in on or forced to abide by.Of course, Quora has been completely fooled or is actively in on this too, with human moderators and bots alike collapsing answers challenging how serious \u201cCOVID-19\u201d is (let alone challenging its existence at all) as factually incorrect. This makes it important to check the collapsed answers, because they just might have exactly the dissenting opinion you need!So why are governments really imposing all these restrictions? It is either to test us for compliance for something much more sinister (I actually had a Quora question show up in my feed about this, and I\u2019m following it), the U.S. Republicans\u2019 latest voter suppression strategy, or else they are just that power-hungry and think they\u2019ve finally found an excuse to turn the entire world into one big police state.If I wanted to \u201cexplain away\u201d COVID-19 MAGA/Trump-supporter style, I could change my claim about media lies to: The liberal media are lying to you. Coronavirus is a hoax, and the only reason that Donald Trump has \u201cacknowledged\u201d this at all is because he was basically at gunpoint from his \u201cmedical experts\u201d to do so. Is it any wonder, then, that the \u201coperant truth\u201d seems to change on you so much? Coronavirus is a hoax, and if Trump claims that again, it may seem like backpedaling at first blush, but in fact he is finally free to tell us the truth again!Again, I do not actually believe any of these bullet points. One thing I know for sure is that Donald Trump is exploiting Fox News\u2019 long-standing narrative that \u201cthe liberal media are lying to you\u201d to get away with obvious pandemic response blunders and even changing his story all the time (because most, if not all, of his followers either have short memories or don\u2019t trust their own memories, due to the relentless admonitions from Fox News that leave its viewers afraid to turn it off and distrustful of \u201cliberal\u201d news sources (which includes actually moderate/neutral ones.)) Snopes actually rates the claim that \u201cU.S. President Donald Trump referred to the new coronavirus as a \u2018hoax\u2019\u201d as \u201cMixture\u201d because while Trump did \u201cliken the Democrats' criticism of his administration's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him, saying \u2018this is their new hoax\u2019\u201d and downplay the severity of the pandemic, he did not literally claim that coronavirus is a hoax (or at least it\u2019s ambiguous): Did President Trump Refer to the Coronavirus as a 'Hoax'? Some other things that Trump said about coronavirus afterwards can be found here, though I take it that \u201ctrue believers\u201d in Donald Trump would dismiss it as \u201cliberal media\u201d: Trump Said Coronavirus Would 'Miraculously' Be Gone By April. Well, It's April. One other thing: Notice how I didn\u2019t cite any sources for my \u201ccoronavirus is a hoax\u201d claims? That\u2019s because there is no actual evidence of this, and the only way I can support claims like that is to speculate on some pretty wild conspiracy theories as to why the ridiculous claims would be true. This comes from something called confirmation bias, where humans have a tendency to want to believe what they already believe, taken to a logical extreme. It is also an example of a fallacious argument called a circular argument, where you assume the very point you are trying to prove! I am going to go ahead and publish this one. Just follow BNBR, and read the whole answer before judging it. Then again, you probably have read it all already if you\u2019re reading this. ",

            "answer_text": "Allow me to play devil\u2019s advocate. It\u2019s justifiable because you can\u2019t get a second opinion on the matter unless it\u2019s on the dark web somewhere or on some London Real digital freedom platform interview( which are awesome by the way). Creditable doctors are being censored from YouTube for talking on the issue. I guess Dr. Fauci is the only expert on the matter, but even he said at first that the corona virus was not a big deal, before they made everyone wear mask. The mortality rate is at what? 2%? and that\u2019s with the inflated stats. Out of those 100,000 people who supposedly died of covid 19 how many of them would have died from regular flu of whom 50,000 die every year. How many died from pneumonia or other symptoms, but are being classified as covid 19 deaths? There hasn\u2019t even been an increase in death in general compared to other years (Brian Rose, Dr Kaufman interview) If you really read between the lines of these stats we might see that the mortality rate could be much lower than even the flu. Some doctors say that putting some of these patients in ventilators could have probably made the situation worst. It\u2019s a new virus the we are still learning about, and the news sensationalize it, and puts everyone on panic mode. So that\u2019s how people justify it, it\u2019s not right or wrong, and most people don\u2019t say it\u2019s a hoax to be disrespectful or rebellious, they say it because when there is a suppression of information by social media and mainstream media, it just feels like a hoax. Who knows what\u2019s true or not? In my non-expert opinion I think government and media just over reacted, and it\u2019s a lot less worst that they initially thought and that\u2019s a good thing. But the scarcity of it is still out there, and so is the scarcity of a second opinion, because nobody wants to feel like they been lockdown all this time for nothing. ",

            "answer_text": "As much as anything it is Trump and his family who have used the word hoax when discussing the pandemic. Trump whose carelessness is legendary. Instead of heeding the warnings of what might be headed our way he told us with his characteristic cluelessness that \u2018It\u2019s going to disappear. One day it\u2019s like a miracle \u2013 it will disappear\u2019. Consequently our country is knee-deep in a pandemic because of Trump\u2019s foolish irresponsibility. In the United States, misinformation can come straight from the White House. Unfounded claims from disavowed doctors, controversial studies and outright falsehoods have also found oxygen, often among supporters of the president. Here are some of the most commonly repeated claims. Claim: Stay-at-home orders don\u2019t workReality check: False Claim: The U.S. death toll has been inflatedReality check: The U.S. death toll is likely to be higher than official figures suggest Claim: Covid-19 was made in or released from a labReality check: There is no solid evidence to support this One of the most persistent claims is that the virus was manufactured, engineered or released from a lab. One proponent of this idea was the creator of Plandemic, a viral video espousing disinformation from a discredited scientist named Judy Mikovitz. She has also pushes the long-debunked theory that vaccines could \u201ckill millions\u201d. In fact, they have saved countless lives by preventing severe infectious diseases. However, quashing this piece of misinformation has been complicated by claims from the Trump administration that the virus might have been released by a virology lab in Wuhan, China, the original center of the outbreak. The U.S. secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, recently claimed on ABC News there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the virus came from a lab in Wuhan, but provided no corroboration for this claim. And although China has been criticized for failing to be open about the extent of the outbreak, no evidence has yet been produced that the virology lab was responsible. In fact, the most broadly accepted theory of the virus\u2019s introduction is that it originated in a market in Wuhan that sold live, wild animals.

Billions and billions deep.He has parlayed off enough funds between the WHO and John Hopkins to have put his Foundation in the \u201cthis had better pay- off!!\u201d zone. But that's not all , no not even close! There are other entities here with a vested interest in doing this to its Freemasonic ends.You have to realise by now that there is a reason our entire country is littered with square and compass symbolism. It is a very much alive society of persons who have arrived at the corridors of power. But the ways in which they operate are slowly being undone by their own fumblings. It goes without saying that they push every perversion against God that they can dream up.And now they want to dominate even our thoughts and personal drives and beliefs . In a presentation from the CIA archives, a very excited Bill Gates tells the Director And a few other officers and agents. That he possessed the means to infect Taliban fighters with a Corona Virus, that in turn would leave them as \u201cnon religious fanatics\u201d. By way if a nanobot ridden version that would actually leave them uncaring of their religions oppression by Isreali led forces.If that isn't dirty pool I can't think of what would be. This scenario is part and parcel the way in which they release future realities to the American public. Slowly at first, and then all of sudden In prices and parts.I think of my self as far more of a intelligently educated man than the average by the doctrine individual. I give anyone, who can realize and commit to the results if critical thinking, their due praise. ",

In London, Primrose Hill shall beIn centre hold a Bishop's See Around the world men's thoughts will flyQuick as the twinkling of an eye. And water shall great wonders doHow strange. And yet it shall come true. Through towering hills proud men shall rideNo horse or ass move by his side.Beneath the water, men shall walkShall ride, shall sleep, shall even talk. And in the air men shall be seenIn white and black and even green A great man then, shall come and goFor prophecy declares it so. In water, iron, then shall floatAs easy as a wooden boatGold shall be seen in stream and stoneIn land that is yet unknown. And England shall admit a JewYou think this strange, but it is trueThe Jew that once was held in scornShall of a Christian then be born. A house of glass shall come to passIn England. But Alas, alasA war will follow with the workWhere dwells the Pagan and the Turk These states will lock in fiercest strifeAnd seek to take each others life.When North shall thus divide the south And Eagle build in Lions mouthThen tax and blood and cruel warShall come to every humble door.

And flooding waters, rushing inWill flood the lands with such a dinThat mankind cowers in muddy fenAnd snarls about his fellow men. He bares his teeth and fights and killsAnd secrets food in secret hillsAnd ugly in his fear, he liesTo kill marauders, thieves and spies. Man flees in terror from the floodsAnd kills, and rapes and lies in bloodAnd spilling blood by man kinds handsWill stain and bitter many lands And when the dragon's tail is gone,Man forgets, and smiles, and carries on To apply himself - too late, too lateFor mankind has earned deserved fate. His masked smile - his false grandeur,Will serve the Gods their anger stir. And they will send the Dragon backTo light the sky - his tail will crackUpon the earth and rend the earthAnd man shall flee, King, Lord, and serf. But slowly they are routed outTo seek diminishing water spout And men will die of thirst beforeThe oceans rise to mount the shore. And lands will crack and rend anewYou think it strange.

But not on land already thereBut on ocean beds, stark, dry and bareNot every soul on Earth will dieAs the Dragons tail goes sweeping by. Not every land on earth will sinkBut these will wallow in stench and stinkOf rotting bodies of beast and manOf vegetation crisped on land. But the land that rises from the seaWill be dry and clean and soft and freeOf mankinds dirt and therefore beThe source of man's new dynasty.

This guy\u2019s also convinced that Antifa and Nazis are the same thing, somehow (don\u2019t ask me how that\u2019s possible), so that gives you a bit of a window into his thinking. Now, I\u2019m willing to bet that he\u2019ll tell the rest of us drivers a much different viewpoint when someone he knows - maybe it\u2019ll be me, right? - catches the virus and comes back physically changed\u2026or doesn\u2019t come back because they\u2019ve died. He\u2019s not the only one in America, as I\u2019m certain at least one or two million people share a similar mindset here in the States. That\u2019s the sort of mindset prevalent among those people, most of whom are ordinary folks, anyways. For some people, it\u2019s a political hoax and overhyped because the pandemic does in fact harm the public perception of the conservative Republican Party and all officials with that (R) next to their name plate. Everything was going along for them just fine until a crisis hit and caught them unprepared; we\u2019re starting to see line-item budget documents popping up that demonstrate the lack of preparation at the federal and state levels. The people who are saying \u201cit\u2019s an overhyped political hoax\u201d understand that their preferred party stands to lose everything if the image of the Republican Party being in control gets shattered, and they\u2019re terrified of what that will mean going forward. Hope this helps. EDIT: I\u2019ve changed a couple of things for clarity. ",

If I am really lucky I might find a quiet spot on the bank to rest up a bit. The rocks and the river are not conspiring against me. They don't even know I am passing by.

The people in on the hoax could pretend to be sick, but they couldn't fill up hospitals unless all the medical people were in on it. Maybe this is possible in a few hospitals, but it is hard to see how it could be done in huge numbers of hospitals around the world. Second, if you tried to have the \u201cpatients\u201d at only some hospitals in a region, how do you keep the staff at other hospitals from asking why they weren't seeing it at all? You would need willing or unwilling support from nearly everyone in a health role. Third, media of all sorts would just have to go to any hospital that was supposed to be overrun with patients, but wasn't to crack the whole hoax. Journalists and their relatives go to hospitals for their own needs. I think this means they all have to be in on it. Fourth, so do the coroners and funeral home workers who have to cover up for the fact that there aren't enough deaths. Remember the whole country is supposed to have a pretty big increase in total deaths. That's hard to fake. Fifth, you have a challenge with the general population in places that are supposed to have high rates wondering why they don't know anybody with the disease. Almost every government in the world would have to be in on it too. You may have seen a handful of people claiming to have evidence that this is a hoax, but for it to be a real hoax there would likely be millions of every nation and political alignment. I don't see how you do that. ",

Then, when it seemed that the virus might be something to worry about, they reversed course and attacked the president because he hadn\u2019t done enough. Their whole strategy for dealing with the virus was to use it as a means to attack the president. And now that it\u2019s turned out that it\u2019s not as big a problem as we were led to believe, we still face the nightmare created by the gubernatorial responses to the virus - locking down whole states as if they were New York City (while praising Cuomo as though he\u2019s handed it well when in fact, his decisions made NYC the worst pandemic hotspot in the country.)

When I hear someone accused of thinking COVID is a hoax, it\u2019s usually that they\u2019re saying something like the above. It\u2019s also occasionally just a completely unfounded smear. ",
