            "answer_text": "Why is it important to zero the spectrophotometer? Can\u2019t say I know the specifics of a spectrophotometer. However, something I see taken for granted everywhere but precision manufacturing is Calibration - Wikipedia. instrument calibration and the metrologists who do so concern themselves with the things most people forget: that tape measure isn\u2019t a perfect inch/cm. It has manufacturing flaws, tolerances of the instruments that make it, wear and tear, even weather that affect how long that tape actually is, and therefore how inaccurate it is. So when you\u2019re measuring something, what is zero? What is one? truth is we\u2019re blindly trusting the instrument in our hand, and unless you\u2019ve gone through some lengths to verify or control those conditions, you\u2019re rolling some dice that nothing changed much. In home construction, thats probably ok. In Aerospace, you can lose a multi-million dollar system over a small measurement futz. A spectrophotometer measures intensity based on at least the same two specific things for nearly all measurement tools in existence: its default state (in this case, no power to your light wave), and its excited state, which is often just measured as a difference from its zero state. Its the same reason that a scale that reads 1.0 with nothing on it will never be right. I have more familiarity with lower frequency RF; same principles apply. When an instrument is so finicky that you need to know or control air temp and humidity at a microwave level\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine a higher frequency wave on the spectrophotometer are magically more forgiving. Something to think about it next time you grab a torque wrench for your lug nuts: how sure are you really that its measurement is right? If its older, how do you know it didn\u2019t change? ",
