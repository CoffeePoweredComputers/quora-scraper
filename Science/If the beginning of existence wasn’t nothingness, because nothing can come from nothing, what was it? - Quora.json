            "answer_text": "Nothingness is a concept. There is no evidence that nothingness exist except as a counter concept to existence. The same is true of infinity vs the finite. Logically, infinity and nothingness cannot coexist with existence. If nothingness was infinite there could be no existence. If one assumes that existence is real, the logical choices seem to be. 1) Existence from nothing in a one shot occurrence with a beginning, and an ending in further nothingness. 2) Periodic existences with intervening periods of nothingness. If not infinite then virtually equivalent to 1), if infinite then virtually equivalent to 3). 3) Infinite existence with no beginnings or endings, except maybe as arbitrarily defined by humans. Existence from nothing where existence never ends appears to be outside a logical frame of reference because it indicates a dual infinity which is counter intuitive to the concept of infinity. It is also outside a human frame of reference, because we know of no phenomena which has a beginning that has no end. There is no law that says existence has to be logical. But, human cognition appears to lose relevance if it isn\u2019t. Humans are equipped with certain perceptual tools, plus the ability to imagine. Use of perceptual tools allows humans to expand their perception of what appears to be existence.and communicate meaningfully with other humans about it. That which is outside perception can only be imagined. Imaginations do not contribute to human learning or communication unless they can be brought within the perceptual. And, if imaginations are counter to the perceptual they drift into that area where human cognition is irrelevant. In summary, neither choices 1. 2. or 3. can be perceived. So imagine whichever you will. Or, don\u2019t be logical. Many humans aren\u2019t, maybe most. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: If the beginning of existence isn\u2019t nothingness, because nothing can come from nothing, what was it? A: Prepare for some serious weirdness: There is actually nothing stopping you from getting something from nothing, as long as you can conserve energy. And that is actually possible. Pick up a ball and throw it up in the air. You convert chemical energy via your muscles to kinetic energy in the ball. At the top of the throw, the ball is still for a second. It has no kinetic energy. So where did it go? The classical explanation is that it was converted to potential energy, that will then go back to kinetic energy as it falls down. The kinetic energy at the start at the throw and the potential energy at the top of the throw must be the same. But basically, that\u2019s just bookkeeping. You can actually do that bookkeeping exercise on an entire universe: you can regard gravity as negative energy potential, just as you do with the ball. If you then sum up all energi and matter in the universe in one column of your bookkeeping, and all gravity in the other column, they may actually cancel one another out. There are in fact some measurements that support this interpretation, including the geometry of empty space. That means that if those two columns are the same, the sum of them is zero. And you can get all matter and energy in the universe from nothing, assuming you also get all the gravity at the same time. Not only that, you could even say that the universe is still nothing, only very unevenly distributed. This weird hypothesis is called the Zero Energy Universe hypothesis, and it has some serious proponents, like Lawrence Krauss. It is not the only model of how you can get a universe, but those do not necessarily start from nothing. For instance, the Predecessor Black Hole hypothesis notes that the big bang looks a lot like a time-reversed black hole, also known as a white hole, or \u201cthe other side\u201d of a black hole. So this hypothesis suggest that the universe could have begun as a star in a previous universe collapsed to a black hole, causing our universe to big bang on the other side. And there is the Eternal Inflation hypothesis. In normal cosmology, there was the bang, followed by a short time of not much happening, followed by the inflation period where the universe expanded from the size of an atom to the size of a grapefruit. The Eternal Inflation flips the narrative: there has always been an eternal exponentially inflaton field, but because of a quantum fluctuation, a bubble of it slowed down. It didn\u2019t stop expanding, it just slowed down to about 70 km/s per megaparsec, and is slowly speeding up until it will match the speed of the rest of the inflaton field. This bubble is of course our universe, and it could happen elsewhere in the inflaton field as well. There is also Roger Penrose\u2019s idea of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology. The idea is that the early universe consisted of nothing but energy in the form of photons. And from a photon\u2019s perspective, there is no time since it moves at the speed of light. Strangely, this is (from a photon\u2019s perspective) indistinguishable from the end of the universe, the Heat Death of the Universe scenario, where all matter has decayed to photons and even black holes has evaporated to photons from Hawking radiation. And that in turn would mean that as soon as the Heat Death of the Universe happens, there will immediately be a new big bang. And that\u2019s not all: there is also the Big Crunch hypothesis, in which a previous universe collapsed under its own gravity to a singularity which then expanded in our big bang. And so on, and so on: there are many models of how you can get a universe, and some of them gives you a universe from nothing. All of them have two things in common. None of them violate physics as we know it.We can\u2019t test any of them, because if we go back in time, the physics as we know it loses accuracy at [math]10^{-12}[/math] seconds and reaches its limits at [math]10^{-43}[/math] seconds (which is another story, and this answer is long enough as it is). There is one elephant in the room: creatio ex nihilo, or creation from nothing, is Christian dogma. ",
