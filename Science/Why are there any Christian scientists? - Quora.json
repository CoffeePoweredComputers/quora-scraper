            "answer_text": "Why are there so many Christian scientists? A lot of people I talk to seem to think that religion (in this case Christianity) is slowing down scientific improvement and that religion and science can ultimately not co-exist. How can there be top scientists (physicist, engineers, etc) who believe in the (Christian) God? There is a small group of very outspoken biblical literalists who have religious beliefs about nature that are irreconcilable with what we discover by examining nature itself. They rather deny the findings of science and fight science like it was Satan himself. They think their God asked them to do it and they risk Hell for holding heretic beliefs (=science). Those people will never pursue a career in science because their religious beliefs prevent it, because of their belief in the false dichotomy that science = atheism. They do it so convincing that even some of my fellow atheist confuse attacks on science with a threat to their position of disbelief. Those science deniers are relatively small group of Christians the rest of Christianity sees no problems in pursuing a career in science. There are a lot of Christians worldwide so there are also a lot of Christian scientists. However it is of course true that science can be a catalysts for atheism, causing people who enter the field as Christians to end as atheists. Compared to the general public scientists are less religious, that could also be due to the difference in personality profiles of people interested in science. Summary: Atheism is not a necessary condition to become a scientistsBeing a scientist doesn't necessarily lead to atheism",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Proportionally, there are probably fewer Christians who are professional scientists today than there were 150 or 250 years ago as the modern world is far more secular and specialized now than it was then. However, modern science and the scientific method was essentially invented by Christians who were interested in pursuing truth. Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton are just two examples of leading figures in the development of modern science who were also devout Christians. Two or three centuries ago, there was no perceived conflict between devotion to Jesus Christ and pursuing natural science where ever the data leads. I find it ironic that the OP seems to believe that Christianity is stopping scientific advancement when it was Christianity that gave us science in the first place. A Christian worldview is not stopping scientific progress. What is stopping the advance of science are closed minded people who are dogmatic in their beliefs. The New Atheists are just as guilty of this as the most ardent Young Earth Creationist. Using political means to condemn study of design or disallowing the discussion in public schools of Intelligent Design concepts shows just how entrenched Darwinism has become in the scientific community. Using propaganda, politics, or the courts to quash dissenting views against the mainstream Darwinian view has done more to hurt science than all the people in scientific fields who model their lives and behavior on the life of Jesus Christ.
