            "answer_text": "pH is a measure of concentration. If you mix two equal volumes of different concentration, the answer is the combined amount in the double volume. The first solution with pH 2.0 has 10^-2 = 0.01 mol of H+. The second solution has 10^-2.1 = 0.00794 mol of H+. The combined volume has 0.01794 mol, or 0.00897 per the original volume. The negative logarithm of 0.00897 is 2.05. So, the new acidity is simply the mean pH of the two concentrations. ",

If volumes mixtured are equal, then pH of the mixture = -log (10^-2 + 10^-2.1). This work for solutions with the same acid. Different acids will have diferents pKas and can \u2018strech\u2019 the dissociation. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer would depend on a number of factors, such as: what are the volumes of the solutions being used in preparing the mixture? will any ions be removed upon mixing (for instance, by precipitation)? are the solutions sufficiently dilute that the volume of the final solution will be the sum of the volumes used in making the mixture?
