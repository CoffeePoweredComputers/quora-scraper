            "answer_text": "The real math part is done for the kids. Kids are given the part that real users of math use a calculator for. Real math is used in decision making. The answer will help someone decide which option is better. In math class, how does a wrong answer affect which choice a child makes? It doesn\u2019t. There is no decision to be made. Whether the answer is right or wrong, the answer ends up in the trash. That\u2019s not math. That\u2019s calculation. Real math is problem-solving leading to a decision. Video games are actually a great source for real math. The game provides a scenario. The child understands the particulars of it. They understand what they know \u2014 like how much power they have \u2014 and what and why they don\u2019t know what they need to know \u2014 like whether it\u2019s enough to beat the next boss. The game provides data in a variety of formats for the child to use to gain a better understanding. The situation is set up so the child doesn\u2019t need a precise answer. And that\u2019s good! Different situations call for different amounts of precision. It\u2019s useful to get to know when precision is needed and when a guess will do. (It took me several semesters of college engineering courses to let go of the school-imposed need to get an answer to the umpty-gazillionth decimal place.) The beauty is a child doesn\u2019t need to perfectly understand everything to make a decision. They just need to know enough to make a guess. The child can use trial and error to find out more about the problem. They can fight the boss and see what happens. From the outcome, they learn more about their own situation and about what they need to defeat the boss. They can use research in manuals to find out more about the boss they\u2019ll face. If they decide they need more power, they can use their understanding of the game to figure out the most efficient way to get more power. The problems the child solves in a video game aren\u2019t real, but they tap into the skills people use in real life to solve problems. Real math involves analytical thinking to make a choice and solve a problem. School math robs kids of the important part. All the analysis is done for them. They\u2019re told what they want to know, never mind why they want to know it, and what formula to use (eg, the formula the chapter is covering) to get the answer. That\u2019s just plug and calculate. ",

            "answer_text": "The thing that frustrated me in a middle school setting was students being expected to reinvent the wheel. In 8th, these students spent over a month on slope halfway through algebra. They struggled with a concept (multiplication) that we were taught in 3rd or that my friend\u2019s daughter grasped at 3. To expect the stupid to come up with some basic math, even when it has already been shown to them repeatedly, is like the very definition of insanity. ",
