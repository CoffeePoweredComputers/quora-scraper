            "answer_text": "Interesting question. The reason people find this question difficult is that they have incorrect ideas in their heads about colour. For example, they think that green light is light at, say, 580nm, and blue light is light at 420nm. If they think this and then they see green light passing through coloured glass and changing colour, then the only thing they could reasonably think is that the glass changes the wavelength of the light. The solution to this is to understand that their initial assumption is wrong. it\u2019s true that when you see light at 580nm it is green. But when you see green light it is not necessarily light at 580nm. This distinction is critical because unless you are looking at a rainbow or a laser, whenever you see green light (or any coloured light) it is never just light at a single wavelength. So when you see a green light in practice it is almost certainly a light that contains all the visible wavelengths (though obviously, because it is coloured, the intensity is much greater at some wavelengths than at others). Why does this combination of light look green; because of the visual system. So when this green light (that contains energy at all the visible wavelengths) passes through a coloured glass, the glass absorbs some of the wavelengths more than others (that\u2019s why it\u2019s coloured). The result is that the spectral distribution of the transmitted light is different from the original incident light - and consequently appears a different colour to the visual system. This misunderstanding extends to objects such as paints, plastics and textiles. For example, it is commonly believed that a green t-shirt is green because it reflects light at, say, 580nm and absorbs all the other wavelengths (and the visual system sees the green light). But this is categorically not what happens. If you look around the room you are in now, all of the objects around you reflect all the incident wavelengths to some extent (but obviously the coloured objects reflect some wavelengths more strongly than others). The t-shirt looks green because the particular distribution of wavelengths reflected are seen as green by the visual system. This misunderstanding also explains why people ask questions such as what is the wavelength of white light or what is the wavelength of pink light? Because they think colour is physical and has a one-to-one correspondence with single wavelengths. I have a series of YouTube videos that explain this - you can find them from my home page at the University of Leeds where I teach and Research Colour Science. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure \u201cshift\u201d is the correct word. White light is the combination of Red, Green, and, Blue, RGB. When white light passes through a red filter, the Green and Blue components of light are absorbed. There are ways to \u201cshift\u201d the wavelength or frequency of light: Fluorescence - a material absorbs light and then re- emits at a different wavelengthNon-linear optical crystals can frequency triple a high amplitude beamThere are other ways to do this, but these obvious cases come to mind. Again, a colored glass filter tends to absorb the other primary colors. If the frequency was shifted you would expect to have no reduction in amplitude. After a colored glass filter there is a decrease in amplitude because the other colors have been absorbed. ",
