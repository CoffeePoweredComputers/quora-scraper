            "answer_text": "The gum base itself does not dissolve. The sweetener, added flavorings, any softening agents, and coatings do dissolve. The mass and volume of sugarless gum remains much more constant than a piece of, say, Bubble Yum.  To give you an example of how much added ingredients there are in gums that contain sweeteners, I will look at Bubble Yum: 1 piece sugar-free Bubble Yum = 5 grams, 10 calories. 1 piece regular Bubble Yum = *8 grams, 25 calories*  [a difference of 3 grams = roughly 1/2 teaspoon]  1 tsp sugar = 15 calories 1 tsp corn syrup = 19 calories Regular Bubble Yum contains both sugar and corn syrup. So that one small piece of Bubble Yum contains more sugar than gum base. I have no data, but I would guess that in the example above, the product dissolves by roughly half during the process of chewing. ",
