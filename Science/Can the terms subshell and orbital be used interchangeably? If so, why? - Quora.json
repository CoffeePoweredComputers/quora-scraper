            "answer_text": "They are not the same. In one shell, there are several sub-shells. Within a sub-shell, there are several orbitals. See diagram below:  (image from Shells and Subshells The orbitals in an atom are arranged in shells and subshells. Shell: all orbitals with the same value of n Subshell: all orbitals. - ppt download, slide 1) Visually, see the diagram below:  (Image from Difference between shells, subshells and orbitals) To go into a bit more depth: you may know there are 4 quantum numbers: principal quantum number (n), angular momentum quantum number (l), magentic quantum number (m\ud835\udc59) and spin quantum number (m\ud835\udc60). In a shell with principal quantum number n, there are subshells each with angular momentum quantum number, l = 0, 1, 2, \u2026 (n-1) . In each subshell with angular momentum quantum number l, there are orbitals each with ml values ranging from -l to +l as shown below:  (image from General Chemistry Chem 110 Revision - ppt download, slide 4) So the image above shows: same \ud835\udc5b - shellsame \ud835\udc5b and \ud835\udc59 - sub-shellsame \ud835\udc5b, \ud835\udc59, and \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc59 - orbital(Difference between shells, subshells and orbitals) I hope this helped :) ",

            "answer_text": "They often seem to be but they represent two different approaches to \u201cvisualising\u201d the behaviour of electrons in an atom. The former sort of gives an outline of the average distance from the nucleus and the latter the form of the wave function describing the electron. Both can be confusing and only represent stages in the evolution of our understanding of electrons in atoms. ",
