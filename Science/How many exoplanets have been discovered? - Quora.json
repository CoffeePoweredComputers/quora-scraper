            "answer_text": "The site NASA Exoplanet Archive lists 4,151 confirmed exoplanets as of April 16, 2020. The most recent discoveries were added on 16 April and consisted of a five-planet system HD 158259 and individual planets at CoRoT-30 b and CoRoT-31 b. Other exoplanets have been claimed, but not yet confirmed. For example, an announcement was made in April 2019 of a second planet at Proxima Centauri, but it has not been confirmed by other astronomers. Most exoplanets have been detected by indirect methods like dips in light curves or spectroscopic variations in their parent suns motions. However, 49 exoplanets that have been directly imaged are listed at Fireflies Next to Spotlights: The Direct Imaging Method The video shows three planets in motion at system HR8799. This is a very young system and the three planets are hot and show up in the infrared.  ",
