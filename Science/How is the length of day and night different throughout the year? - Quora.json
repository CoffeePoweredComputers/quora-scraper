            "answer_text": "Day and night often battle for domination of the whole 24 hour period because of the earth\u2019s tilt. The earth is tilted at roughly 23.5\u00b0, but varies between 22\u00b0 and 24.5\u00b0 over a period close to 40,000 years. Without this tilt every day would be exactly the same day to night ratio. This tilt is believed to have been caused by the creation of the moon, and is maintained by it. As the earth is in it\u2019s orbit around the sun, it tends to \u201cwobble\u201d meaning that at any one time, it\u2019s not sitting directly perpendicular to the solar plane on it\u2019s axis. In the northern hemisphere, when it\u2019s winter, the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun so the night comes quicker. In fact, in the most northern parts of the globe during winter, the sun never rises for months. The opposite is happening in the southern hemisphere during \u201cwinter\u201d because technically, it is their summer. When the north is tilted away, the south is tilted closer. This swaps in the north\u2019s summer and the south\u2019s winter. As an extension, there are four special days throughout the year when the high points of the earth\u2019s tilt are in action. These are the summer and winter solstice and the autumn and spring equinox. The summer and winter solstice is the longest and shortest \u201cday\u201d respectively, the days with the longest daylight hours and shortest daylight hours, also respectively. These shift between hemispheres so when one hemisphere has it\u2019s summer solstice, the other is experiencing the winter solstice. The equinoxes are when the earth\u2019s equator passes through the centre of the sun. These occur on the 20th March and the 23rd September. This is just the fancy way of saying that the earth is sitting as straight as it can on it\u2019s axis. These occur the same regardless of hemisphere because neither hemisphere is any closer or farther away from the sun. If you were standing on the equator during the equinoxes, during midday, then the sun would be directly above you. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of the Axial tilt and how the earth presents itself towards the sun at different times of the year due to that tilt. So the earths angle of tilt is 23.5 degrees. This results in the Arctic and Antarctic circles being 90\u201323.5=66.5 Deg of lat North and South. It also results in the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn being at 23.5 degrees North and 23.5 degrees South. On the Equinox The sun shines equally on the entire planet. It will lie directly over the equator . But as the Earth continues on it\u2019s Orbit around the Sun the Axial tilt will either be towards or away from the sun depending on ones hemisphere. Lets consider the Southern hemisphere . So on the equinox on Mar 21(+/-) The sun was over the equator. This is also the first day that the Sun has risen in 6 months if you were at the North Pole. If you were at the South Pole the sun will set for the first time in 6 months. As the year progresses the sun will lie further and further North until it is directly over the Tropic of Cancer 22.5. The day will be June 21 (+/-) On this day the Winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere or the winter solstice in the Northern hemisphere The entire area above the Arctic circle will have 24 hrs of daylight. The entire area above the Antarctic circle will experience 24 hrs of darkness. After the Solstice the areas of total daylight and darkness will begin to shrink as the sun moves southward towards the equator. and then the next equinox when it will rise at the south pole and set at the North. All areas of the planet get effected by this daylight darkness cycle. It is less noticeable at the equator and in the tropics and most of coarse at the poles and above the Arctic and Antarctic circles. It is what gives us our seasons. ",
