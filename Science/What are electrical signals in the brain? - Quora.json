            "answer_text": "It is popularly thought that the major electricity in the brain consists of neurons' electric signals along axons to the synapse to another neuron. This electrical signal, called the \u201caction potential\u201d travels along the axon and usually triggers the delivery of a neurotransmitter to another neuron. Occasionally this signal sends a more direct electrical signal through a \u201cgap (electrical) junction,\u201d to another neuron. The triggered neurotransmitter signals become part of a computation of all the signals landing on one dendrite from many different neurons. The summation of all of these signals on the dendrite of a postsynaptic neuron determines whether the next neuron will send a signal or not. ",
