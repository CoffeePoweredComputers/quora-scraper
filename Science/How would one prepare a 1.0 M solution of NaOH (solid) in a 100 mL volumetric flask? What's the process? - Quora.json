            "answer_text": "It's a fairly simple procedure, based on a couple of basic chemical principles. A one molar (1.0M) solution of any compound contains exactly one mole (mol) of molecules of that compound  in one litre of solvent (usually water).The molar mass of a compound is equivalent to the sum of the atomic weights of all of the elements which make up its chemical formula.  The units of molar mass are commonly g/mol.From this information you can calculate the weight of NaOH that represents one mole of pure solid NaOH.  Then, to prepare a 1.0M aqueous solution, you would normally dissolve this calculated molar mass of NaOH in a little less than one litre of water in a volumetric flask, before filling it up to the one litre graduation mark. However, you specified a 100ml volumetric flask. Therefore you will only need one tenth of the amount of NaOH that you calculated for one litre. Calculate this amount of NaOH and weigh it out. Perform this weighing rapidly because NaOH is deliquescent and will increase in weight by absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. Prepare the solution in a 100ml volumetric flask using distilled water and correct analytical practices. Remember that the dissolution of NaOH in water is exothermic. Which means you will have to cool the flask down to the calibration temperature (usually 20C) specified on the side of the flask before filling to the graduation mark. Good luck! EDIT: I see that Lili already beat me to the punch. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Others have given you the procedure. However, be warned that the concentration will only be approximate no matter how careful you are. There are two reasons for this, and both relate to the lack of purity of the solid you are weighing. As you weigh sodium hydroxide, it is able to absorb moisture from the air. It is said to be hygroscopic. If you live in a place with high humidity, this can be quite significant. So part of the mass you are weighing is water, not sodium hydroxide. Additionally, carbon dioxide from the air will dissolve in this absorbed moisture, making carbonic acid which will react with some of the sodium hydroxide, again altering the mass of the substance you are weighing and changing its purity. So you will have a solution that is approximately 1.0 M. If you want to use it for analytical work such as titrations, you will need to standardise it with something that can be a primary standard.
