            "answer_text": "most basically socieities are organized life in groups. For a human society, ( as opposed to ants or wolves , for example) there needs to be shared culture. Culture is how you do things, how you define things, and how you communicate those concepts to each other. One of the famous ways of describing how societies develop is the bands tribes chiefdom states continuum. Elman Service developed this concept, where the political organization is combined with the social organization and economic base. Social organization includes kinship ( families) and communities, economics includes the broadest sense of that term- think food water and technology ( tools) rather than money and markets. Renfrew and Bahn have applied it to the archaeological record. Most introductory 4 field anthropology textbooks will include this organization to a greater or lesser degree. The 4 fields are cultural anthropology where you study culture- how different people concieve of the world and the relationships of people - linguistics- how people communicate with symbolic language - how concepts are formed in the mind and communicated to others- archaeology- the study of past human cultures through their material remains, and physical ( or biological) anthropology the study of the bearers of culture- human beings. Your question is so big, there is really no 1\u20132 paragraph answer, it is one of the main themes of the science of anthropology. The basic outline can be seen in Services format- simplest societie s being hunter gatherer Bands; they forage in nature to find food, and live in groups of about 30 people in very large ranges. You then get tribes- collections of related groups, with some form of food production, which allows for a higher population - which gives more involved needs for social organization - to Chiefdoms, where the higher population numbers require more elaborate social organization, and ranks enter in to the social organization - people are very egalitarian in bands and tribes. You then get to higher population numbers, and food production moves from gardens and herds of animals to intensive agriculture - including ploughs and irrigation- which support a lot of people but require a huge network of people working to maintain the system\u2026which leads to the state, the level of organization most of the world lives in today\u2026with lots of hierarchy and differential access to resources. You need to take an introduction to anthropology course or read an anthropology textbook to get a better idea. You could look up Renfrew and Bahn or Elman Service for a start. Good luck and enjoy! ",

Intervention I of III 1. Get into a meditative state of deep relaxation. 2.

When totally immersed inside of this Energy-time-space place \u2026 slowly expand and spread that energy field into a huge infinite space in all directions. Then after a minute or so \u2026 begin to stretch your sense of time of 10 seconds into 10 weeks by slowing your sense of time way, way, way down until time literally stops.

Practice this at home for say three or four times so you can literally do this automatically in less than 15 seconds. And when you can do this, you can then almost automatically and without advance notice . . . find your inner self doing this automatically . . . at any time in traffic, or at the office, etc. You can even catch you automatically saying to someone that may have just pushed an old button \u201cHarry, that is important so let me think on that for a few seconds.\u201d Then look away, run this simple Mind-Over-Emotion strategy, and then come on back and just smile in the peace of mind where all brilliant ideas flourish. This is just one of three simple, quick and amazingly easy to learn Mind-Over-Emotion strategies. It\u2019s our \u201cbe**LIE**f s\u201d systems that are creating, generating and propagating their emotions in and throughout our bodies. It\u2019s their fight-or-flight defenses using us to do their dirty work until that is , we wise up to being their emotional hosts and hostages. Suggestion. Learn the A.R.T.
