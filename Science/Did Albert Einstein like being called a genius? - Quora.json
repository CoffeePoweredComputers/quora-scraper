            "answer_text": "Most people who are called such love it and hate it. Love it when it confers social acceptance, hate it when it confers social ostracismLove it when it means you will be considered understandable, hate it when it means you are to be considered indecipherableLove it when the people saying this actually understand the work, and hate it when the advocates have it bollixed up.Love it when it is applied in proportion to self image (we are all ingenious at something) hate it when it confers authority we know we do not deserve (we are all idiots at something)Love it when the title inspires the inner ingeniousness in everyone around us, hate it when its used as bigotry against the status of others.Love it when the title helps secure financial stability, hate it if we are disadvantaged financially by it (people who want to change things SHOULD starve is a common attitude)Love it when we get the chance to pass on what we have discovered/invented, hate it when our work ends with us as too \u201coff trail\u201d to preserveLove it when it when the title leads to greater respect among factions, hate it when factions turn on one another using teachings as weapons of insult.Love it when the title suggest the WORK is significant, hate it when the title suggests the AUTHOR is what we should pay attention to.Love it when the work is put to use for the greater flourishing of civilization in general, hate it when the work is used to destroy competing factionsLove it when the title suggests anyone with sufficient effort can become worthy of being called a genius in some way, hate it when its used as a means of demeaning the intellectual status of others.It has been shown by many studies that the difference between the rich and poor is almost entirely luck, right place at right time with right thing and you get rich, wrong place at wrong time with wrong thing and you get poor.Much of so called \u201cgenius\u201d is the same as \u201cwealth\u201d is just luck with fashion, right place at right time with right thing is a FASHION issue, humans like to believe they are in control of evolution but that can not be the caseThe vast majority of geniuses are never called that, only a few stars are allowed in the common press just as for Hollywood, most get screened out not in, we do not see their names up in lights, we do not apply the term, but there we find brilliant/discovery/invention. The fixation on \u201cstar status\u201d ensures that non star status individuals gets buried and forgotten which is a curse on civilization.Star status based systems are all about gaining power thorough mass production and monopoly, in a world with tailored production this is an artifact from the past that is no longer helpful but is harmful instead.The word \u201cgenius \u201ccan be used to exalt the work of many or to crush the aspirations of many, which is which depends on the attitudes instilled in the general populace.When the term is used to instill unquestioning obedience it does disservice, but when it instills unrelenting curiosity it is of service.

            "answer_text": "I think Einstein was most probably indifferent to being called a genius. He openly gave credit to other scientists that came before him and whose work was inspirational and instrumental in his own work.Einstein was a humble person. He never bragged on himself or about any of his work.He was very friendly and never made anyone feel uncomfortable when he met them or while having conversations, especially with those who were not scientifically minded.As world famous as he became, he led a simple life after he left Germany and moved to Princeton, NJ. He enjoyed teaching, giving lectures, boating, taking long walks, and having long talks with his friends.I don't think he thought of himself as a genius. In many of his quotations, he made the point that imagination was far more important than knowledge.",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been called a \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201cEinstein\u201d since I was a child. I learned to take it as a kind of persecution. Being categorized as a \u201cgenius\u201d automatically makes people put a label on you and put you in a box. It is depersonalizing. It is something you must go over. So I have found ways to shield my innocent heart and soul from this jab. No one should ever idolize or flatter another person for that matter. I find ways to deflect it, to not let it sink in \u2014 just as if people were criticizing or jeering at me for something. Anyway \u2014 love and hate are two sides of the same coin: In both love and in hate, you pay full-time attention to the object of your passions. Likewise, with insults and praise, they have a tendency to categorize and depersonalize a beautiful, unique human being with all her faults and foibles and flaws as well as gifts and talents. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually geniuses don\u2019t see themselves as geniuses . Their thinking process is very natural for them and they might even find it confusing when someone thinks they are a genius. I don\u2019t know about Einstein but I would guess that he didn\u2019t care that much if people thought him as a genius. He had much more interesting things to think about. But then again even geniuses are human and I am sure it feels good when someone sees something so special in you that they call you a genius. ",

Technically speaking, it's possible that he wanted to be known as a genius and emphasizing \u201cmodesty\" was somehow part of acquiring the label of genius. But that is doubtful. More likely he couldn't have cared less about being seen as a genius. ",

            "answer_text": "Well you don't have to be a genius to realise that he has done great work BUT usually we also do realise the enormous challenges ahead to elucidate the ultimate nature of existence. I could myself identity from my own research several very interesting research topics that will require several geniuses to elucidate. I am referring here to tough enquiries. That is due to the fact that the universe is a frightfully complex entity about which we can elucidate extraordinary things about which our early scientific era merely scratches the surface. For instance it is very clear to me that both Einstein's relativity and quantum theory are very much incomplete. ",
