            "answer_text": "It depends, but almost 99.9% of the time, you will get pulled into the black hole, and your quantum information will be completely destroyed through Hawking Radiation. However, if you were, theoretically, able to travel faster that the speed of light, you would be able to escape the event horizon. But even after the event horizon, the gravitational pull will only increase. Perhaps we can even hypothesize that tachyons, which are a hypothetical particle, will eventually be pulled into the black hole, despite being able to travel faster than light. if you can travel faster than light, you can escape everything up to the end of the event horizon. After that, you\u2019ll become an information-absent nothingness :) ",

            "answer_text": "depending how close the object is to a black hole. It is impossible to escape the event horizon of a black hole. But It is not impossible to escape a black hole gravitational pull. we see that in our supermasive black hole located at the center of our galaxies. We observe large stars being sling shot away from the black hole at tremendous speeds. NASA used a similar technique to accelerate their voyager props. Gravity assists explained simply\u2014 How the Voyager spacecrafts escaped the Solar System ",
