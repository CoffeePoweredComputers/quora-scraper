            "answer_text": "EDIT: I wrote this answer back in 2012, before the direct detection of Gravitational Waves. In September 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) observed a GW signal consistent with the merger of two black holes (see e.g. Leo C. Stein's Session). Therefore, there is now direct observational evidence to suggest that pairs of black holes routinely merge with each other throughout the universe (another merging pair was observed in December 2015, and at the time of this writing, Advanced LIGO is upgrading). I leave my original response below. Yes, black holes can merge. If two black holes orbit each other, their orbit can decay due to emission of gravitational waves. Eventually, the two black holes come close enough to \"plunge\" and form one larger black hole. The gravitational wave signature of this process is one of the predictions of General Relativity which may be tested in the next decade (or two). For stellar mass black holes, these events are more likely to occur in the centers of globular clusters (where the more massive black holes will congregate due to mass segregation). Supermassive black holes (which reside in the centers of galaxies) may capture lots of objects, some of which may be stellar mass black holes. When two galaxies merge, and each contains a supermassive black hole, the two black holes will sink towards the center of the merged galaxy and end up in orbit about each other. By three-body interactions, this orbit can lose enough energy for gravitational wave emission to become efficient in driving the system to merger. This process should occur once per galaxy merger. So far, BH-BH mergers are purely theoretical: we have never observed black holes merging. This is easily understood for stellar mass binaries, since stellar mass BH-BH systems do not have matter to give us a luminous signal. The most promising way to detect a BH-BH merger is with gravitational waves, which may happen in the near future by second generation ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Funding issues aside, we might some day see a space-based gravitational wave antenna similar to the LISA design. ",

            "answer_text": "What Happens When Two Black Holes Collide? The collision of two Black Holes is a pretty rare event in our Cosmos.  Firstly, it is important to understand the ENORMITY and sheer density of these beasts! A typical super-massive Black Hole can harbor a mass anywhere form many millions to several billions times the mass of our little Sun! The LARGEST Black Hole ever found is in the galaxy HOLMBERG 15A. The black hole at it\u2019s core is 15,000 light years across!!! Wondering about it\u2019s mass? \u2026. 170 Billion times that of our teeny little Sun! Yeah, I know that\u2019s a little intimidating\u2026 So, what would happen? Such catastrophic events can have 2 possible outcomes\u2026 \u2026. which depends on the speed at which the two black holes are travelling, how fast they are spinning, and the angle of their collision! If the two Black Holes are spinning at very high speeds and come together at juuuuust the right angle, the smaller black hole will be sling-shotted away from the bigger black hole and sent hurtling through space! Similar to how two spinning coins bounce off each other when made to collide. The most likely outcome is that they will come closer and closer slowly until they cannot escape each other\u2019s gravity and they eventually become one! Such catastrophic events can cause a havoc in the neighborhood! The Resultant Black Hole is what we call a Binary Black Hole. As the two beasts start to merge, there would appear to be a distorted mess of matter. But, as they come even closer together, the resulting black hole goes through a process known as Ring Down. This is when any distortion in the shape is slowly dissipated and the new Binary Black Hole becomes all the more spherical in shape, until any asymmetry is lost ! The Binary Black Hole is now once again a swirling vortex of death which wanders around in the Cosmos, like an escaped prisoner, hunting for food! The Energy emitted from the collision will be so great that it would send ripples through the Space-Time Fabric of the Universe. Let\u2019s just soak that in for a moment\u2026 The collision of the two black holes is so violent event that it cause ripples in the Space-Time Fabric of the Universe! Like a gigantic pebble in a pond!  These ripples are what we call Gravitational Waves. Why is it that these Gravitational Waves are a vital branch of physics? That\u2019s because they a fundamental component of Einstein\u2019s Theory of General Relativity! The detection of these Gravitational Waves at LIGO prove their existence. It is an irrefutable evidence to backup Einstein\u2019s Theory as well as increasing our own understanding of gravity and how it behaves!  So, if you see that two Black Holes are about to collide\u2026. Get the Hell Out of There!!! Thanks for reading :D ",

            "answer_text": "A question I've been pondering for a long time. Well what I do we see when this happens. A big explosion and then gravitational waves. So Why? My belief on this is both black holes have matter pent up in there event horizon sort of like what happens at a plank distance of a particle that forms the neutron and the proton which are in my mind a layering of matter. Starting in the center in a E8. Electron microscope picture of hydrogen shows this. It just a big ball of matter particles I think dark matter caught tightly in a vortex or singularity. So the two black holes merge but do they merge completely or does one the smaller one simply stay intact inside the other. I say this because even though one black hole is smaller it may still after some lose of energy on its perimeter be dencer then the perimator of the absorbing larger black hole. Thats easy to understand right. So it may stay intact forever. But it's gravitational field will be now part of the larger whole. Like a planet or anything else. Ok so that's the set up. A black hole full of all sides of black holes. So to the subject. One falls into another suddenly the spin of the absorbing black hole speeds up to the new total gravitational field creating a stretching of the gravitational field as compared to the speeds of it's inflow. This stretching creates a vacume in the field just outside the point of entry. The pent up energy or matter of both black holes is now in a vacume disconnected from the gravitational inflow with not enough gravity to hold it in its previously condensed state. So you get kablewy a galactic explosion. But in a sort time the higgs field regenerates and fills the vacume. Because the stretching creates energy that regenerates the higgs bosen field to refill the vacume. I forgot to mention this aspect of the cosmic foam in a earlier question today oops. So when the higgs bosen regenerates the gravitational field is re established and things or the galexy will return to normal in time. ",

            "answer_text": "It will not swallow !! The two black holes will spiral into each other irrespective of their sizes under immense gravitational-field influence of each other with greater and greater rotational velocity reaching relativistic speeds, until they collide and merge with a resultant supernova-like explosion, with immense energy released, in the forms of light, radiation, kinetic energy of particles and \u2018fragments\u2019, and gravity waves ! There will be unimaginably immense disturbance in the space-time field, with propagation of gravity waves of great intensity. Over billions of years these gravity waves can still retain some energy for our detection ! This is what occured in 2015 when \u2018Laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory\u2019 (LIGO) detected gravity waves for the first time giving grand evidence of Professor Albert Einstein\u2019s prediction of the existence of gravity waves in 1915, one hundred years before their detection ! We simply did not have the technology for it before to be able to detect gravity waves. So going back to the two merging black holes, once the fusion takes place, and the energy release settles down the new black hole will have a mass less than the sum of the two black holes that merged. So if you take the mass of the first black hole as m1, mass of the second black hole as m2, and the final mass of the merged black holes as m3, then the following can be stated mathematically : m3 = (m1 + m2) - E/c^2, where E is the total energy output from the merger. So E/c^2 is the mass converted to energy during the process of the collision/fusion of the two black holes which is the resultant loss of mass in the process. Thus m3 will be less than the sum of m1 and m2. Post-fusion the new black hole will have gotten bigger with a larger mass, having lost some mass in the form of energy as shown above, and having sent gravity waves (ripples in space-time field) throughout the universe that would continue to spread at the speed of light for billions of years though losing intensity with time, crossing billions of light years in distance\u2026 Kaiser T, MD (Life long physics, math, cosmology, and science proponent).

            "answer_text": "Physicists have known for decades that every pair of orbiting bodies is a source of gravitational waves. With each revolution, according to Einstein's equations, the waves will carry away a tiny fraction of their orbital energy. This will cause the objects to move a bit closer together and orbit a little faster. For familiar pairs, such as the Moon and Earth, such energy loss is imperceptible even on timescales of billions of years. But dense objects in very close orbits can lose energy much more quickly. In 1974, radio astronomers Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor, then of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, found just such a system: a pair of dense neutron stars in orbit around each other. As the years went by, the scientists found that this 'binary pulsar' was losing energy and spiralling inwards exactly as predicted by Einstein's theory. The two black holes detected by LIGO had probably been losing energy in this way for millions, if not billions, of years before they reached the end. But LIGO did not register the gravitational waves coming from them until 9:50:45 Coordinated Universal Time on 14 September, when the wave's frequency rose above some 30 cycles per second (hertz) \u2014 corresponding to 15 full black-hole orbits per second \u2014 and was finally high enough for the detectors to distinguish it from background noise. But then, in just 0.2 seconds, LIGO watched the signal surge to 250 hertz and suddenly disappear, as the black holes made their final 5 orbits, reached orbital velocities of half the speed of light and coalesced into a single massive object.

            "answer_text": "Yes it can. But there are two different models to explain this. One is kind of science fiction (but it is the prevailing idea nevertheless), the other has its feet on solid grounds (sic). The prevailing idea makes us believe there is a mass inside the Black Hole of such dimensions that nothing can escape it. But look closer at the dynamics recently uncovered and you can know this answer is not all that correct. Still, and this is answering your question with this model in mind, when two of them meet, they become a stronger Black Hole (the mass more intense and anything else even less likely to escape). An alternative model is that of a Black Eye, which is like the Eye of the Storm, a circumstantial entity (of enormous magnitude) that is ravenous at its center but does not contain a mass itself. It means that a Black Hole is really a Black Eye, the synergistic outcome of the entire setting and not a specific entity itself. Black Hole Perspectives Yet Untold Basically, the model currently in use only needs to be updated to state there are two levels to gravity: one associated with mass, and one associated with the collective of mass. Everything else can stay the same. All evidence stays the same, except for the model. So, answering your question with the updated model in mind, when two Black Eyes meet each other, we need to look at the larger settings to declare what is going on. It can be compared to two Storms in the Atlantic becoming one and subsequently both their Eyes then merging into one. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and they frequently do this is one mechanism of how they become so big it's called mergers and usually happens when a galaxy collides with another or in the case of a blackhole their combined gravational influence combines to mean that 2 or more collide with each other. We can observe the effects of this using Ligo and other specialized large scale scientific equipment aka radio telescopes, although what we are looking at usually happened thousands or millions of years ago as the deeper you look into space the further back in time you look to appoint where your looking at something that happened long before the earth or even we excisted. Although having seid that the exact amount of blackholes out there is astronomically high in-fact the number is so high you couldn't even get an exact figure as space it's self is littered with literally more stars then there are grains of sand on every beach in the world. Blackholes form, die and ultimately are observed by our telescopes every nano second as most are formed from exploding stars or Super Nova's and they go off like fire crackers in every part of the known universe so fast that we can't possibly observe every one. If you want to know more a great start is to watch the documentary series called space which is nerated by Sam Neil who also was in the movie Jurrasic Park or you could watch the series called cosmos these two will give you the awnsers that you need.

            "answer_text": "No. Black holes are not actually \"holes\".  They do not swallow things.  They are merely points of matter that are extremely dense, such that if you get close enough to them you can't escape their gravity and you will be pulled in, no matter how fast you go. But you don't fall \"into\" a black hole.  There's no hole to fall inside.  You'll fall onto it and get crushed down to an extremely  dense point and become a part of the black hole. So if two black holes were close enough to one another, they would potentially be attracted by their mutual gravitational pull.  If they got close enough to one another, they would basically \"fall\" onto one another, and be crushed into a single, more massive black hole.  One does not go into the other; they merely merge into one. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, a black hole can absorb another black hole. This usually occurs most often when galaxies merge into a new galaxy. The centers, which have a black hole, merge together into a new center of a new galaxy. The black holes combine together to form a new black hole. Of course, not all galaxies are the same. Irregular galaxies don\u2019t really have centers, they are more like clusters of stars and remanents of them. Normally, it\u2019s the elliptical and spiral galaxies that have black holes in their centers. The new galaxy that forms (usually an elliptical) will have a new black hole. However, the mass of the new black hole is less than the sum of the masses of the former black holes due to a loss of energy (E=mc^2). It is also possible the black holes, that is just around in a galaxy, will combine with another one randomly. ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes exist only in somebody's imagination. The basis of the theory is an assumption that a body can collapse under its own gravitation. One exercise in PHYSICS 101 is to integrate the gravitation inside a sphere. If it is hollow there is no net gravitation anywhere inside. If it is solid then gravitation gets lower as you approach the center, and at the center it is zero. Isaac Newton was the first to point out these things. In real life gravitation depends a lot on the density of rocks and materials nearby, and also on centrifugal force as the body rotates. So the foundational assumption of the black hole is nonsense. Shell theorem - Wikipedia In Einstein's theory the gravitational field, manifest in the curvature of spacetime, is coupled to its sources by the field equations, the sources being described by an appropriate energy-momentum tensor, and so the Principle of Superposition does not apply. This means that one cannot simply pile up masses in any given spacetime because the field equations must be solved for each and every configuration of matter proposed. (This paragraph was taken from Black Holes May Get Supermassive by Eating Stars but they deleted it from the article. Apparently somebody couldn't stand the implication of what it said.) Second source: A Blind Man in a Dark Room Looking for a Black Hole that isn\u2019t There For the final nail in the theory, it depends heavily on the gravitational constant being constant, which it is not. It varies in the third decimal. Gravitational constant - Wikipedia ",

During the counter revolution phase of two BH, they become slow and slower due to their huge intertial massess.( See the second photo) When, they do so, they create an energy, that sun will make in it's whole liftime ( depends on the type of merger).( See the photo 1 for the merger phase) If you're interested, you can go search for the sound of black hole merger( use headphones).

One is bigger and one is smaller. When the two planets collide, they merge to become a bigger planet, but some of the mass is released into space as debris and some energy is released. Similar is a black hole collision (not one absorbing other) a bigger BH is created whose mass is a little less than that of the two combined. Energy is released in a very very very large quantity, and no debris is released, but the debris is actually the energy which comes from the mass defect as per E=mc^2. ",

That is to say, no stars in the surrounding area can be spared, and even the surrounding galaxies will be swallowed up by the black holes. It can be said that if two black holes are really merged, the impact on the surrounding stars will be devastating. ",
