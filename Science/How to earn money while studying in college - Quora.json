            "answer_text": "When I was a college student, the first thing I did to make money, was blogging! Yes, I started a blog and it became 100% successful and brought me $100,000k a month! Just kidding! The blog was a complete failure and I lost my money, time, and energy. But, that was 10 years ago. I am not a college student anymore. College students often work at fast food restaurants and that is completely fine. In fact, I did the same. But the biggest mistake I made was not blogging for 3 years between 2012 and 2015! Now, how can a college student start a blog on the side of a part-time job and studies? Blogging is not something that you can start today and get paid in an hour or tomorrow. I\u2019m writing a step by step guide to starting a niche website. You want to check that first. There is no guarantee that it will ever be going to successful! But, if the contents are great, you\u2019re most likely going to succeed. I have seen many bloggers try to blog for affiliate commissions but to be honest, you are not building a helpful resource here.  How can a college student start a blog? The purpose of blogging should be sharing ideas and experience with others. When I started my architecture blog back in 2008, I wanted to share the modern architectural designs and ideas with other people. As a college student, you can pick your own niche such as the things you are passionate about or something you are interested in. Many college students are interested in photography, videography, filming, cars, etc. You can start a blog about that. Or if you think you have passed the hardest class in your life and you are willing to help others to pass, you can start a blog about that. Now, you are thinking. Umm, where do I start? Where do I write my contents? Well, I think you need to take a step back and think about the search engine. If you want your blog to be noticed by the people, you need to select a niche market. Step 1: Niche market research A niche market allows you to narrow your focus and solve a specific problem! Since you are blogging on the side, it would be great if you could pick a very very small niche and start writing. The example would be, Broad Niche \u2013 Auto Microniche \u2013 Off-road Vehicles So you can start writing about off-road vehicles. Btw, I just did some research and found this microniche is not that competitive but you need to come up with some unique content ideas. Step 2: Content idea generation I was passionate about so many things but I can write about all of them. I\u2019m passionate about road biking. But when I started writing, I was able to write one single article in 3 days! Make sure you are able to write at least 30-40 unique content about the niche that you pick. The best way to understand the niche is to, start writing an article and see if you are getting writer\u2019s block. The Writer\u2019s block is very common at first. But if you are getting the block in every line, then it\u2019s a matter to worry about. Step 3: Saving money to start the blog This step is missing in every blog posts that I see. People say it\u2019s only $2.95 or $3.95 a month for hosting. Yes, It is. But you need to pay the whole year in advance. Hosting:Currently, Bluehost is offering $3.95 a month if you purchase that 3 years or 36 months. If you purchase the hosting with any hosting companies, you need to pay for the full year at least. So, consider $3.95X36 = $142.20 You can buy it for a year but it will be $5.95 a month then. I recommend you purchase for 3 years if you are serious about blogging. Domain: you will get a FREE domain with Bluehost but you need to renew that domain the next year. Most of the http://dot.com domains are $11.99. So, blogging is not free! You should save at least $150-$200 to get it started! But you can start writing using the advantage of free platforms like Medium and Quora. I will write content pretty soon about how to start blogging on WordPress. Benefits of starting a blog in college There are several benefits that I have missed in my college days. But, I don\u2019t want anyone else to miss. Here are the benefits of blogging in college. Resource building You are building a resource on the side of your studies. This resource can be used by you or other people and it will help others to get things done. Income stream A blog is a great way to earn active and passive income online. Your blog can help other people and you can build a business around it. Most bloggers love to do affiliate marketing and that\u2019s fine. But in order to make some serious cash, product launching is important. Marketing Even if you don\u2019t know how to market your or other people\u2019s product, you can be able to know how to market yourself by starting a blog. Helping others Your blog can be a go-to guide for your audience. That way you grow audience and fanbase who can trust you. So, do you think you can do it? A blog takes a while to grow. Even if you start in college, you can be able to get the full advantage once you get out of college and wait for your employer to pick up your resume. ",

            "answer_text": "Right now I\u2019m a college student too! I\u2019m at UIUC studying computer science. Anyway, I make money re-skinning apps. My first year re-skinning, I made over $15,000 working just 1 hour per week. It really doesn\u2019t take much time and fits perfectly into my busy schedule. I think one of my favorite parts about re-skinning apps is that you don\u2019t even need to know how to code! Re-skinning apps is a simple process. You purchase/create an app template, change the graphics, and then sell the app. It will typically take a person 1 to 3 hours to complete the whole process depending on their experience level. After re-skinning apps for over a year, I\u2019ve found that the typical re-skin will make $100 to $300. However, I\u2019ve had single apps sell for as much as $2,000! Most part-time jobs you can get while in college would take forever to pay you this much! If you\u2019re interested in getting started, I would first recommend checking out Chupamobile. Chupamobile is a website for buying app templates. You can usually get a good template for between $50 and $250. This might seem like a lot of money for a template, but you have to remember that once you buy a template, you can re-skin it as many times as you want! Once you\u2019ve selected your template, you need to re-skin it. I like to keep things simple so I usually only edit stuff like the colors, backgrounds, text, icon, and screenshots. Doing advanced stuff like adding features just takes a lot of time and doesn\u2019t pay off very well. Once you\u2019ve completed re-skinning the template, you\u2019re almost there! Now you just need to sell it. I always sell my apps on Flippa, a website for buying and selling apps and websites. Once you sell your first app, re-skin the same template again and repeat the process until you have enough to buy another template! If you think that re-skinning might be a good option for you, I would check out my YouTube Channel for more in-depth tutorials on re-skinning apps. In addition, you should join my Facebook Group to chat with other re-skinners and beginners so we can all learn together! I\u2019ve tried all the other ways to make money online - FBA, Dropshipping, Affiliate Marketing - and re-skinning apps has by far been my favorite. I would definitely give it a try if I were you! Good luck with money and with school! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a question that every student thinks once in college. But many lack the driving force. i.e., why they need to earn money and what are the things that they should do to earn money while in college. Now coming to the question Why Should they try to earn money? Your why should be clear as this will only help you to earn money. You should have a particular reason for which you had considered to earn money. I\u2019m citing some of the common reasons below:- I want to learn new skills that will help me to excel in the long run.I want to earn some pocket money so that I could cover some of my expenses.I have a family issue and I want to earn to support myself and my family.I want to be financially self- dependent.I want to utilize my free time after college.I need money for buying some gifts/fulfill one of my desire.These are some of the reasons. You may have any other reason other than this. So once you have the answer to Why to earn, now the next question comes to light How can they earn money while in college? There are many ways by which money can be earned, both online and offline. I\u2019ll try to cover both the online and offline ways by which a student can try to earn money without hampering their studies. Offline ways to earn money:- Providing Tuition Classes:- One can teach students who are studying in schools. By providing tuition, you\u2019ll help the students and get paid some money. You can form tuition groups also to teach many students at a time.Insurance Agent:- You can join any Insurance company with a good reputation. They will give you every detail about the policy and you can try to sell those policies in your circle. So you can work on your own time after college and also learn sales skills.Assistant to any business:- You can work as an assistant for any business like any groceries, stationery, clothing stores, etc. You can also work as an assistant in any business around your locality for 4\u20135 hours after college.Event Manager:- Event Management Companies hire college students for different types of work such as decoration, catering, etc. So you can work after your college hours for event management companies, as most of the events take place in the evening.Campus Ambassador:- You have to promote a brand or company which hires you on your college campus. Many brands search for campus ambassadors and your main work will be to coordinate the brand's message to your college peers.Mystery Shopper/Auditor:- Many Companies provide mystery shopping opportunities where you have to go to the pre-assigned store/outlet and notice some pre-mentioned points like the surrounding atmosphere, cleanliness, etc. You have to behave like a normal buyer and do as instructed. After the audit is over, you have to fill the questionnaire, where you have to mention the findings of your audit. Once you submit your information, you\u2019ll receive the reimbursement if you were told to purchase anything and you\u2019ll get some money for doing the audit.Online Ways to earn money:- Website Developer:- If you\u2019re tech-savvy and can develop a website on Wordpress, you can earn money by helping people to make their websites. You can make some handsome money by offering to build your client's website.Graphic Designer:- If you\u2019re good at photoshop or can edit pictures, you can provide graphic designing service you\u2019ll design graphics according to clients' requirements and get money in exchange for your service.Logo Designing:- If you can design professional logos, you can approach startups and small businesses and provide your service to them.Content Writer:- If you\u2019re good at any language and can write compelling content, there are many opportunities for you.

Once you get a client and deliver the work effectively, you\u2019ll keep on getting projects.Digital Marketer:- If you have some idea of digital marketing, you can sell your digital marketing skills to businesses. You can approach local businesses and offer them to increase their sales and generate revenue for them digitally. Help them to transform from offline to the online mediums of marketing and they will be happy to pay you once you get the results for them.These are some of the ways by which one can earn while studying. People are more reluctant to pay when you produce results for them. You need to learn new skills and upgrade your skills. There are many other ways like blogging, affiliate marketing, YouTubing, selling online courses, network marketing, etc which I could not mention here. If you want to know more about any of the topics mentioned above, do ask me questions about that. You can also message me for any kind of assistance and to know more about these types of work.

            "answer_text": "My father has never been a big businessman. He would earn enough to sustain the family with mostly the basic needs. My mother used to do household chores and help my dad with his shop. My elder brother lived with my maternal uncles' my sister studied in government institutions all her life.My parents could not do much to my siblings. So they wanted to try their level best to make their life a success; for one last time try to be great parents to their kids a role model to them; and I was their last chance.I got admitted to an, Assembly of God Church (an English medium) school. I was quite a bright student and more than being great in studies understood a lot about the world and how it works, how money matters, how savings work, etc.Even as a school kid I knew it for a fact that making money is important.Back in those days I used to buy stickers I loved to collect them and I observed most of my friends at school were also very fascinated by my collection and would wish even they could have such kind of collection. This marked the foundation of the first business plan Of my life in my head.Selling stickers!Within a week I had collected like 100 rupees (Quite a big sum for a first standard student at least, 15 years in the past).OK! So this was the beginning.The pilot phase of my business was done and was way too successful.I was happier than ever in my life.But soon like every good thing this had to end. I had been very furious at supplying the exceeding demand of stickers in my class and soon most of the people had a huge collection enough to make them feel contented. My business showed a decline. I got worried, but was never disheartened (kind of not the kids' thing I feel, they are always hopeful and cheerful; unlike the oldies). I had to think of the expansion phase of my business.I wanted a new idea; and very soon I got one. I stopped selling stickers to my friends and did not do much for a while waiting for the wave to settle.  Then I launched a new item to my friends a flip book with cute cartoons on it. For next few weeks this was hot in the market, and then again the same fate as before.But by now I had mastered the rules of the game.Since I had a small group of people at hand the quantity of demand will be less. So to keep the group engaged I need to keep switching the articles quite frequently. Next time onwards whatever would go out of demand would be replaced by something new and promising. It kept me going for a while but not for long. My friends were kids as well just like me, with limited pocket money. So soon the consumerism decreased. Soon enough I called my business off, but still it lasted an year long. I tried many similar tricks and hacks to make money from countless things (providing the list will only lengthen my answer so let me not) in later years of school. Fast forward it to clg...I was in first Year pursuing B.Tech from NITK, Surathkal. My friends needed a lot of things like books, drafters, drawing boards, etc. There was a guy who would sell these stuffs in college campus. I observed, this guy would buy old goods from the seniors at extremely low prices and would sell them with a really significant margin. I had it all.. The skills to break into his business.I tried to grab as many such articles/stationery from friends/seniors, pay them a little higher than what the guy paid and sell them at a slightly lesser price than at what the guy sold at. Thus I enjoyed making money even there. Though again it did not go for long but this time I was doing it all for fun (as by now both my siblings have got into work and were earning enough to support the family and me).I repeated this for the next three years in a row and enjoyed it quite a lot. So my suggestion to you my friend is look for opportunities, around. All you need is a careful look at things around and you will get it. People are in need of something or the other for sure. You only need to find out the demand; & if you can not find one then Generate one. There is nothing like a \"STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE \" on making money. Extremely sorry for making it long, could not help!Thanks for reading! :) ",

            "answer_text": "Well, this is the perfect time to make some money (for a student) and to learn an important business lessons.1. What's going on? First you need to choose your targets (for example students, because most of them are big consumers). Next you need to do a marketing research or just research to see \"what's going on\" in your city. What they need? What they want?2. Make a budgetFor example if you have 1000$ you need to choose something which is easy and creative. Something they didn't see everyday.3. Do it!Do not let anybody to tell you \"It's a bad idea\" or \"You are crazy\" . Do not listen them. If you think you can do that, do it! If you believe, do it! This is the perfect time to see how the \"business system\" really works. If you have enterpreneur mind, you will learn very important lessons. I will give you an example , what I did in my 2nd year at the university.I was in Italy and I saw one guy who make baked potatoes on the street. When I saw it and when I smell those baked potatoes I reazlie how good is that idea. I buy one and I saw how he make it. I ask him about the baking machine and I saw how easy is it. He get one big potato, cut it on half and put some stuffs inside (butter, sweet corn, cheese, ham & etc.). It was awesome and guess what? When I get back at home I start looking for a spot near the university. I found it and I start negotiate about it. I find the equipment and I bought it. On the first day I sold over 25 potatoes and the people really like it. They start talking about it and at the next day I sold 45-50! So now I gave you an example what I did. Clear your mind. If you can travel somewhere, do it (that helps me a lot). Get some ideas and don't waste your time. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You can do work study. I did that in college and the best part was that I could work around my classes. Your school may post the jobs on their website or you can ask a department if they have any work study jobs available and they can give you the information to apply. If work study isn't what you want to do, you can find an off campus job. I also did that in college. The only problem I had with that was once while I was taking my exam, my manager kept calling me to ask me to cover someone else's shift while she knew my class schedules. It was pretty embarrassing, but there are a lot of companies that will be willing to work with your schedule. If neither of those are something that you are interested in, I would recommend starting your own business. I know someone that started a very successful T-shirt business at my school. There was also one person that started a moving company and made really good money from that since you'll ALWAYS have business since literally everyone in college is moving at some point Lastly, you can work from home. At the company I work for, there are a lot of people that are students. A really great thing about my job is that we can select our own hours and work as much of as little as we want to. We can also select the projects in which we want to work. You can find great work from home jobs at Real Ways to Earn Money Online. That's where I found all of my work from home jobs from. Plus, it'll help build your skills and you can add it to your resume. I wish you the best in finding a way to earn money while in college! Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Before I begin let me tell you something! I am a college student currently pursuing my master's in Computer Applications from my state university. I stay in my college hostel & guess what, before a few months (just after taking admission here) it's really hard for me to manage all my expenses in a tight budget. And at that time I desperately want to make some money so that I can handle all my expenses. Well, I searched a lot on the Internet & found a few ways, but it seems really hard for me to make a lot of money.  It is so because almost 99% of what I found on the Internet is a pure scam. Well, now (just after 5\u20136 months) I am making awesome money online. Not that much, but something like 300\u2013400$ per month. If you're looking for ways to make money online, then you can stay with me in this answer! Here are some of the ways that I am using to make money online. 1.Online Surveys Online surveys are the easiest & fun ways to make money online. However, the only problem is 99% of survey websites you'll find on the Internet are not going to pay you for your hard efforts. Well, you don't have to worry! I am here to help you. Below is the list of 100% genuine websites that you can trust: YouGovSwagbucksGoogle Opinion RewardsRakuten InsightsI encourage you to join all the above websites for maximum ROI.

Here is the list of freelancing websites where you can get work: FiverrUpworkFreelancerGuruI make 100 to 200$ online by selling my Gigs on Fiverr 3. Blogging One of my favorite ways to make money online. In past one year I've made more than 1000$ via blogging. You have to select a niche (e.g. sports), create a website & start posting content (articles). Once you start getting enough traffic you can monetize it & start making money. It's a bit complicated if you're not a technical guy to start your own blog. However, If you want me to help you start your own blog then you can send me a direct message on Instagram (@itsharishjoshi) & I'll help you for free. You can use Blogger or WordPress to start your free blog. I make 200\u2013300$ per month via blogging online. These are some of my best ways to make money online.

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s what I did back in college. Like most students and needed money. I discovered that you could buy websites and run them from anywhere. From there, I bought websites for $50 at a time and resold for $300 and did that for a while and increased in the amount I was dealing with to the thousands. This is called website flipping To successfully flip websites you need general skills such as: Market Knowledge Know the common multiples for websitesKnow how to properly value websites so you know when you\u2019re getting a good deal or notThe differences between the marketplaces. Flippa, FE International and BizBuySell are all different marketplaces and you need to understand how each one works.Know the current trends of online businesses and websitesAnalytical To be successful at website flipping you have to be able to find deals and this requires you to analyze all marketplaces frequentlyKnow which websites are a good buy and which ones aren\u2019tKnow the strengths and weaknesses of the site before purchaseDelegation You might be able to run one or two websites by yourself but at some point you will need to hire someoneKnowing which tasks to outsource is very importantThose are the general skills that you MUST learn.

            "answer_text": "41 Sites That Pay You to Refer Friends (Earn up to $13,000!) It\u2019s actually a reality! It\u2019s known as Paid Referrals. Anyway before we begin! Here my number 1 recommended strategy  FREE BOOK - DotComSecrets, The Underground Playbook For Growing Your Company Online... By only giving this a look you will be amazed Word of mouth has been one of the best and most reliable ways for companies, big and small, to get new customers. Heck, when I used to make my living as a floor installer, 99% of my clients were referred to me by their friends, family, and neighbors who I had done a job for previously. People trust their friends and family more than they trust an ad they see on TV. And that explains why word of mouth has been and still is, the most effective form of advertising. Companies know this! They also know that people who are referred by their friends are more likely to become lifelong customers. All of that, combined with the fact that traditional advertising costs a lot of money, gave birth to the idea of Paid Referral Programs. Paid referral programs, or referral marketing, isn\u2019t exclusive to the world of businesses and consumers \u2013 companies also use it to hire new employees. Employees referred by other employees are much more likely to stick around for longer because they feel more obligated. According to the Wharton School of Business, a referral customer has a 16% higher lifetime value than your average customer. This is so effective that even universities use it. For example, Vanderbilt University Medical Center has a nurse referral program where they give $2500 to any employee who successfully refers a registered nurse. What is a Paid Referral Programs? It is exactly what it sounds like \u2013 you get paid for bringing in new customers to a company/website. Instead of spending millions of dollars on traditional advertising, some companies rely on their existing customers and user-base to get the word out. And to entice you (the existing customer) to talk about their services and products with your friends and family, they are willing to pay you. How do you get paid Now, the exact amount you get paid depends on a few factors. Same applies to the way you are paid. Some companies will pay you a set amount, once. Some companies will pay you a recurring commission for every month/year the person who you referred stays a customer. Some companies give you a percentage of what your referrals spend. When it comes to actually getting paid, some sites pay by PayPal, some by check, others let you redeems your earning with gift cards and other prizes. Ready to make some referral cash? To make it easier for you to get started, we have gathered a list of companies and websites with paid referral programs, across different industries. If you were to refer one friend or family member to each one of these companies/sites, you\u2019ll earn close to $13,000! Let\u2019s make you some money! \u2013 Travel Services Let\u2019s kick off with some travel services that offer rewards for referring people. Traveling is something that just about all of us do \u2013 whether it\u2019s staying in a hotel, or catching a cab, most of us use some kind of travel service on a regular basis. These services will reward you for your referrals so that you can travel the right way: freely! 1. Lyft Lyft is the competitor to the service giant Uber, and they make for some serious competition. For drivers at lyft referring another person to become a driver will make you both eligible for $500 in bonuses! 2. Uber This giant service that serves as something of the new form of taxis in the 21st century is known for fast, reliable service (but the cost sure can add up!). Every time someone uses your referral code, you\u2019ll get a discount towards your next ride. If you can get the word out there in a big way, then you might be able to get around town free for a while! 3. Airbnb You\u2019ve probably heard of Airbnb, the crowdsourced lodging service that has been expanding operations for the last few years. Airbnb can make a great alternative to traditional hotels and motels, but there\u2019s no mistaking that sometimes it can get pricey. Remedy that by earning $25 in Airbnb credit for each referral you make \u2013 and $75 for each referral who ends up becoming a host! \u2013 Financial Referrals Another thing that many of us are involved in is banks and financial institutions. Well, believe it or not, many banks actually have some hefty referral awards if you can get a friend to create an account or sign up for a card. Your bank might not be one of the banks that offers referral programs, but don\u2019t fret \u2013 there are still loads of other opportunities on this list worth taking advantage of! 4. Capital one 360 Capital One 360\u2019s referral program is built on the idea of quantity over quality. You get a comparatively small $20 per person signed up. But you can keep collecting referral rewards until you reach $1000 collected! 5. Smartypig By far the most obscure service in the financial section, Smartypig is a service where you allocate funds for a project (like an online piggy bank). You declare a goal and pursue it, whether that means saving up for a TV or a trip overseas. Smartypig will give you $10 per referral, but you can refer 100 people. 6. Citi international Citi is offering some very generous referral rewards, which could be anything from a free tablet to a $500 reward. Any Citi customers should definitely look out for this opportunity since the rewards are so great. No word on whether or not you get capped out after a certain amount of referrals, though. 7. Chase You need to refer a friend to sign up for a card with Chase for your referrals, and they\u2019ll actually need to use it \u2013 no dummy entries here! You can refer up to 10 people. As for the friends themselves, they get an incentive in the form of a $100 cash back if they spend over $500 within their first few months. This one is a bit unique in that everybody benefits for participating. 8. U.S bank If you\u2019re a US Bank customer, you can get up to 5,000 FlexPoints for your referrals (which is between $875 to $5000 worth of FlexPoints, depending on what your sources are.) FlexPoints are like cashback points, so you should have no shortage of things to spend them on! 9. Southwest Rapid reward credit card Southwest Rapid is offering you 5,000 bonus points per referral, up to a total of 30,000 (or 6 referrals.) That\u2019s more bonus points than some other rewards programs will offer, which makes this a very desirable option for any Southwest Rapid customers. You can also try my simple number 1 recommended strategy  FREE BOOK - DotComSecrets, The Underground Playbook For Growing Your Company Online... 10. PNC workplace Bank PNC WorkPlace Banking is a service that enables you to tie your banking functions into your workplace. It sounds a bit strange at first glance, but it works great in the right situation. You\u2019ll get $100 per coworker referral, with the rewards capping after 5 referrals. 11. Discover card This one functions very similarly to Chase\u2019s program \u2013 Refer friends to become cardholders with a max of 10. You get your reward after they activate the card. However, on this one, the monetary incentives are scaled back a bit (the friends receive $50 cash back, but there is no minimum to spend in order to claim it.) \u2013 Technology Company Referrals Technology is increasingly something that humans can\u2019t live without. Whether it\u2019s a highly advanced service like a television provider or a basic internet access, we can all agree that having money to spare on your tech services is a good thing. Here is a list of a few tech companies who will reward you for referring: 12. Dish network You\u2019ll get $50 per referral with 10 referrals allowed per year (netting all 10 will make your service essentially free for a few months!) Dish also offers an initial incentive of 5 free PPV movies on your first referral, so it\u2019s worth your time to recommend at least one person you know. 13. AT&T AT&T has one of the most fleshed-out referral programs of all the tech companies, allowing you to make nearly $600 through referrals each year. What makes this a convenient referral program is that you only need to refer the customers to the AT&T itself, and any service they purchase will count towards your referral. This is opposed to something like a banking referral program that asks you to get cardholders, exclusively. You\u2019ll earn $25 per customer referred, which makes 24 people a year to get to the max amount. 14. Verizon What makes Verizon\u2019s referral program unique is the fact that you can be paid out in cash instead of credit with the service. This adds another dimension for potential referral-hunters out there who are looking to earn extra money. You\u2019ll get paid $25 per referral, with a max of 5 referrals. 15. Google app The ins-and-outs of this program are a little bit unclear, but what you can tell from the link provided is that you get paid $7.50 per person referred to Google Apps. You\u2019re referring them to the Google Apps paid subscription, that is, but this is a very common subscription service in business circles. Refer up to 100 people for a max earnings of $750. \u2013 Gym Referrals Believe it or not, yes, you can get paid for referring people to gyms! As we all know, gyms rely on driving a ton of memberships, and this is just part of that process. If you have a friend who is already looking to join a gym, these are perfect options. I\u2019ve collected a few big name gyms below, but don\u2019t forget that even local gyms might have a referral program in place. If there\u2019s a non-franchise gym in your area, it\u2019s definitely worth going in and checking about their referral opportunities. 16. Health works This group is offering a very healthy $50 per person referred, but the downside is that it\u2019s a women\u2019s only gym \u2013 sorry guys! However, if you\u2019ve got the opportunity to take advantage of this option, the $50 could easily knock out your membership fees for a while. 17. Gold's gym You\u2019ve almost definitely seen one of these before, and there\u2019s a good chance that there are one or more Gold\u2019s Gyms in your area. This referral program won\u2019t offer you money or credits but will give you rewards for referrals, which is worth looking into if you\u2019re already a member. 18. Equinox This fitness group is offering gift cards per member referred. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t disclose the amount, so this is an offer best left to people already involved in Equinox. 19. 24-hour fitness Here\u2019s a referral program that\u2019s pretty neat \u2013 you can get a $20 MyStore coupon for your referrals, which is fairly standard. Or, you can choose to have one 50 minutes personal training session. That\u2019s a pretty cool offer, as referral programs go. If you really drove home some referrals, you could socialize AND get a PT course out of it \u2013 how\u2019s that for free stuff? \u2013 Affiliate Programs Now, you may or may not have heard of affiliate programs before. They\u2019re kind of a big deal! There are thousands and thousands of blogs out there that exist solely to take advantage of these affiliate programs, which are something of a next-level referral program. It\u2019s an entire section of the blogging industry. How does it work? Put simply, you write about a product and provide a link to a place to buy the product. Nothing unusual there. The only difference is that the special link you use enables you to get paid for whatever purchases they may end up making. It\u2019s that simple, and for some, it\u2019s a full-time job. There are a few more nuances, but that\u2019s the gist of it. Sounds scary, I know, but don\u2019t worry, just a brief mention and you\u2019re in the clear. A small price to pay for getting in on affiliate programs, which can be pretty great. 20. Fitbit We\u2019ll kick off with Fitbit since they might have the highest commission rate here at 12%. That\u2019s right \u2013 12% commission on all items you sell through your affiliate links to their products. Fitbit doesn\u2019t make the most expensive products in the world, but you\u2019re getting a great cut at 12%. 21. Target Target\u2019s affiliate program is a bit more middle-of-the-road at 5%. It\u2019s not amazing, but if you\u2019re advertising a big-ticket item, 5% can be a welcome rate to make in return. 22. iTunes To start, I couldn\u2019t find the exact rate that you make in commissions on iTunes. However, that doesn\u2019t disqualify it from the possibilities since you can link to so many different kinds of media (everything from movies to music.) You might want to sign up to this one just for the variety. 23. Walmart Walmart\u2019s characteristically shrewd pricing shows in the commission rate of 4%, but that\u2019s still nothing to balk at when you consider that the partner in question is Walmart. 24. Barnes & nobles Barnes & Noble also have an affiliate program. I went looking all through the terms and conditions, but I couldn\u2019t find the compensation rate \u2013 suffice it to say that there are definitely some people out there taking advantage of it, so it might be worth your time. Great for book blogs. 25. Amazon affiliate I had to save this one for last because this is the absolute king of the affiliate world, so much so that the word \u2018affiliate\u2019 might trigger the word \u2018Amazon\u2019 in your mind. Amazon\u2019s unprecedented selection of products makes them the clear leader in this case, but what\u2019s more: they have a sloping commission rate. Your base rate is 4%, but jumps to 6% and then even 8% or above, depending on your sales volume per month. This is huge news for writers and reviewers out there, and indeed, many people make their living exclusively by running Amazon Affiliate blogs. You\u2019ll even get the commission if they click away and buy a different product \u2013 anything they buy for a little while after clicking your link is credited to you. Now that\u2019s awesome. \u2013 Work at Home Referrals You must certainly be wondering, \u201cWhy would an employer pay to obtain employees? Sounds sketchy.\u201d Indeed, I\u2019d see your point \u2013 it does sound a tad sketchy at first glance. However, that\u2019s simply because these are call center companies, and the call center industry has an insanely high turnover. A lot of people just don\u2019t like call center work, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t work for you. Check out these companies\u2019 referral programs and see for yourself. 26. working solution This group is hiring people to do anything from tech support to customer service, to sales. They\u2019re also offering a pretty great commission \u2013 $100 per person! 27. call center QA Call Center QA is a company that works with telephone mystery shoppers. Basically, it means you\u2019ll be calling a store and pretending to be a customer, but really, you\u2019re gathering information to report back to Call Center QA. Kind of fun, like being a secret agent. The work is flexible and low-barrier to entry. They pay you via PayPal and give you $5 per referral. 28. liveops This is a call center looking for independent contractors who are willing to work from home (though, their company name sounds more appropriate for the secret agent work of Call Center QA.) The only requirements for working at LiveOps are an open schedule and the ability to commit to 10 or more hours of work a week. No word on the official payout for referrals. \u2013 Digital Services Referrals The explosion of the internet and the \u2018blogosphere\u2019 means that digital services are now their own, massive industry \u2013 and that means referral programs will come in tow! Some digital services reward you with monetary gains, some reward you with enhanced service. 29. dreamhost Let\u2019s kick off with DreamHost because they have a pretty cool system in place \u2013 you get your flat earnings in addition to another $5 every time one of YOUR referrals, makes a referral! Affiliate systems like this are pretty great since they allow multiple levels of reward to funnel back to you. 30. Groupon This one is really simple \u2013 get $10 in Groupon credit for every friend you refer. 31. Dropbox This revolutionary file-sharing service will reward you with additional space every time you refer a friend. 32. Hostgater Another great referral program that rewards you more the more people you refer. It goes up from around $50 a person to $125 a person later on, and that\u2019s nothing to scoff at! If you have an audience who will sign up, definitely get in on this ASAP. 33. Evernote Another service based reward, this time very simple: refer a friend and you both get access to the premium service. It\u2019s that easy! 34. media temple This referral program is another one that benefits all involved: For you (the referrer): Free hosting For them (the person you referred): 20% Off 35. Amazon prime The Amazon Prime referral program is kind of like a light version of the Amazon Affiliates program. You get $5 Amazon credit for each Prime member you refer who makes a $5 purchase. \u2013 Rewards Programs I saved this one for last since we\u2019re back to basics a bit. These are those classic GPT (Get Paid To) task sites that we all know and love. You may not know, however, that they are good for referring, too. Let\u2019s look at how some of these programs work to finish off our list: 36. opinion outpost This big-name reward site has two different ways to make money, and it differentiates between \u2018referrals\u2019 and \u2018affiliates.\u2019 At a glace: Affiliates go for a quantity approach. Any valid account that is registered from your referral nets you $1, whether they use the site or not. Referrals give you $2 per person, however, they\u2019re required to complete a survey first. Twice the pay, but you\u2019re banking on the idea that the people will actually use the site! 37. swagbucks Our old friend SwagBucks makes an appearance in the affiliate ring with their referral program. You can get 1000 SwagBucks per referral, which is roughly equivalent to $10. No limit on max referral numbers, so get the word out there on this (already popular) site and let the rewards come. 38. valued opinion This is a survey-exclusive site that wants people to give feedback on products and other consumer interests. You get $2 per person joined, on the stipulation that they first complete 2 surveys. 39. points2shop Here\u2019s another one of those multi-level referral types discussed before. You only make $1.50 per referral, however, you get a 15% cut of their lifetime earnings. Refer a handful of dedicated users, and you\u2019ll be sitting pretty! 40. survey savvy This site is a legitimate survey service that allows you to make between $3 and $20 per survey. Now, how does the survey reward tie back to you, the referrer? Well, you make a 15% cut on all lifetime earnings for your referrals, so those good rates are a boon for you. This online survey company is trustworthy and reliable, so don\u2019t worry about wasting your time by taking a chance on them. They\u2019re tried and true. 41. inboxDollars This is a well-varied GPT site that allows all kinds of tasks from videos to games and it\u2019ll reward you for all of it. A great site to spend your time in its own right, but you\u2019ll be even happier to know you can get 10% of the earnings for the tasks done by your referred members. Gather your video-watchers and your game-loving friends and refer them to InboxDollars \u2013 it might be the easiest money you ever make Final words If this is not enough for you Here my number 1 recommended strategy  FREE BOOK - DotComSecrets, The Underground Playbook For Growing Your Company Online...

Let\u2019s make you some money! \u2013 Travel Services Let\u2019s kick off with some travel services that offer rewards for referring people. Traveling is something that just about all of us do \u2013 whether it\u2019s staying in a hotel, or catching a cab, most of us use some kind of travel service on a regular basis. These services will reward you for your referrals so that you can travel the right way: freely! 1. Lyft Lyft is the competitor to the service giant Uber, and they make for some serious competition. For drivers at lyft referring another person to become a driver will make you both eligible for $500 in bonuses! 2. Uber This giant service that serves as something of the new form of taxis in the 21st century is known for fast, reliable service (but the cost sure can add up!). Every time someone uses your referral code, you\u2019ll get a discount towards your next ride. If you can get the word out there in a big way, then you might be able to get around town free for a while! 3. Airbnb You\u2019ve probably heard of Airbnb, the crowdsourced lodging service that has been expanding operations for the last few years. Airbnb can make a great alternative to traditional hotels and motels, but there\u2019s no mistaking that sometimes it can get pricey. Remedy that by earning $25 in Airbnb credit for each referral you make \u2013 and $75 for each referral who ends up becoming a host! \u2013 Financial Referrals Another thing that many of us are involved in is banks and financial institutions. Well, believe it or not, many banks actually have some hefty referral awards if you can get a friend to create an account or sign up for a card. Your bank might not be one of the banks that offers referral programs, but don\u2019t fret \u2013 there are still loads of other opportunities on this list worth taking advantage of! 4. Capital one 360 Capital One 360\u2019s referral program is built on the idea of quantity over quality. You get a comparatively small $20 per person signed up. But you can keep collecting referral rewards until you reach $1000 collected! 5. Smartypig By far the most obscure service in the financial section, Smartypig is a service where you allocate funds for a project (like an online piggy bank). You declare a goal and pursue it, whether that means saving up for a TV or a trip overseas. Smartypig will give you $10 per referral, but you can refer 100 people. 6. Citi international Citi is offering some very generous referral rewards, which could be anything from a free tablet to a $500 reward. Any Citi customers should definitely look out for this opportunity since the rewards are so great. No word on whether or not you get capped out after a certain amount of referrals, though. 7. Chase You need to refer a friend to sign up for a card with Chase for your referrals, and they\u2019ll actually need to use it \u2013 no dummy entries here! You can refer up to 10 people. As for the friends themselves, they get an incentive in the form of a $100 cash back if they spend over $500 within their first few months. This one is a bit unique in that everybody benefits for participating. 8. U.S bank If you\u2019re a US Bank customer, you can get up to 5,000 FlexPoints for your referrals (which is between $875 to $5000 worth of FlexPoints, depending on what your sources are.) FlexPoints are like cashback points, so you should have no shortage of things to spend them on! 9. Southwest Rapid reward credit card Southwest Rapid is offering you 5,000 bonus points per referral, up to a total of 30,000 (or 6 referrals.) That\u2019s more bonus points than some other rewards programs will offer, which makes this a very desirable option for any Southwest Rapid customers.

PNC workplace Bank PNC WorkPlace Banking is a service that enables you to tie your banking functions into your workplace. It sounds a bit strange at first glance, but it works great in the right situation. You\u2019ll get $100 per coworker referral, with the rewards capping after 5 referrals. 11. Discover card This one functions very similarly to Chase\u2019s program \u2013 Refer friends to become cardholders with a max of 10. You get your reward after they activate the card. However, on this one, the monetary incentives are scaled back a bit (the friends receive $50 cash back, but there is no minimum to spend in order to claim it.) \u2013 Technology Company Referrals Technology is increasingly something that humans can\u2019t live without. Whether it\u2019s a highly advanced service like a television provider or a basic internet access, we can all agree that having money to spare on your tech services is a good thing. Here is a list of a few tech companies who will reward you for referring: 12. Dish network You\u2019ll get $50 per referral with 10 referrals allowed per year (netting all 10 will make your service essentially free for a few months!) Dish also offers an initial incentive of 5 free PPV movies on your first referral, so it\u2019s worth your time to recommend at least one person you know. 13. AT&T AT&T has one of the most fleshed-out referral programs of all the tech companies, allowing you to make nearly $600 through referrals each year. What makes this a convenient referral program is that you only need to refer the customers to the AT&T itself, and any service they purchase will count towards your referral. This is opposed to something like a banking referral program that asks you to get cardholders, exclusively. You\u2019ll earn $25 per customer referred, which makes 24 people a year to get to the max amount. 14. Verizon What makes Verizon\u2019s referral program unique is the fact that you can be paid out in cash instead of credit with the service. This adds another dimension for potential referral-hunters out there who are looking to earn extra money. You\u2019ll get paid $25 per referral, with a max of 5 referrals. 15. Google app The ins-and-outs of this program are a little bit unclear, but what you can tell from the link provided is that you get paid $7.50 per person referred to Google Apps. You\u2019re referring them to the Google Apps paid subscription, that is, but this is a very common subscription service in business circles. Refer up to 100 people for a max earnings of $750. \u2013 Gym Referrals Believe it or not, yes, you can get paid for referring people to gyms! As we all know, gyms rely on driving a ton of memberships, and this is just part of that process. If you have a friend who is already looking to join a gym, these are perfect options. I\u2019ve collected a few big name gyms below, but don\u2019t forget that even local gyms might have a referral program in place. If there\u2019s a non-franchise gym in your area, it\u2019s definitely worth going in and checking about their referral opportunities. 16. Health works This group is offering a very healthy $50 per person referred, but the downside is that it\u2019s a women\u2019s only gym \u2013 sorry guys! However, if you\u2019ve got the opportunity to take advantage of this option, the $50 could easily knock out your membership fees for a while. 17. Gold's gym You\u2019ve almost definitely seen one of these before, and there\u2019s a good chance that there are one or more Gold\u2019s Gyms in your area. This referral program won\u2019t offer you money or credits but will give you rewards for referrals, which is worth looking into if you\u2019re already a member. 18. Equinox This fitness group is offering gift cards per member referred. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t disclose the amount, so this is an offer best left to people already involved in Equinox. 19. 24-hour fitness Here\u2019s a referral program that\u2019s pretty neat \u2013 you can get a $20 MyStore coupon for your referrals, which is fairly standard. Or, you can choose to have one 50 minutes personal training session. That\u2019s a pretty cool offer, as referral programs go. If you really drove home some referrals, you could socialize AND get a PT course out of it \u2013 how\u2019s that for free stuff? \u2013 Affiliate Programs Now, you may or may not have heard of affiliate programs before. They\u2019re kind of a big deal! There are thousands and thousands of blogs out there that exist solely to take advantage of these affiliate programs, which are something of a next-level referral program. It\u2019s an entire section of the blogging industry. How does it work? Put simply, you write about a product and provide a link to a place to buy the product. Nothing unusual there. The only difference is that the special link you use enables you to get paid for whatever purchases they may end up making. It\u2019s that simple, and for some, it\u2019s a full-time job. There are a few more nuances, but that\u2019s the gist of it. Sounds scary, I know, but don\u2019t worry, just a brief mention and you\u2019re in the clear. A small price to pay for getting in on affiliate programs, which can be pretty great. 20. Fitbit We\u2019ll kick off with Fitbit since they might have the highest commission rate here at 12%. That\u2019s right \u2013 12% commission on all items you sell through your affiliate links to their products. Fitbit doesn\u2019t make the most expensive products in the world, but you\u2019re getting a great cut at 12%. 21. Target Target\u2019s affiliate program is a bit more middle-of-the-road at 5%. It\u2019s not amazing, but if you\u2019re advertising a big-ticket item, 5% can be a welcome rate to make in return. 22. iTunes To start, I couldn\u2019t find the exact rate that you make in commissions on iTunes. However, that doesn\u2019t disqualify it from the possibilities since you can link to so many different kinds of media (everything from movies to music.) You might want to sign up to this one just for the variety. 23. Walmart Walmart\u2019s characteristically shrewd pricing shows in the commission rate of 4%, but that\u2019s still nothing to balk at when you consider that the partner in question is Walmart. 24. Barnes & nobles Barnes & Noble also have an affiliate program. I went looking all through the terms and conditions, but I couldn\u2019t find the compensation rate \u2013 suffice it to say that there are definitely some people out there taking advantage of it, so it might be worth your time. Great for book blogs. 25. Amazon affiliate I had to save this one for last because this is the absolute king of the affiliate world, so much so that the word \u2018affiliate\u2019 might trigger the word \u2018Amazon\u2019 in your mind. Amazon\u2019s unprecedented selection of products makes them the clear leader in this case, but what\u2019s more: they have a sloping commission rate. Your base rate is 4%, but jumps to 6% and then even 8% or above, depending on your sales volume per month. This is huge news for writers and reviewers out there, and indeed, many people make their living exclusively by running Amazon Affiliate blogs. You\u2019ll even get the commission if they click away and buy a different product \u2013 anything they buy for a little while after clicking your link is credited to you. Now that\u2019s awesome. \u2013 Work at Home Referrals You must certainly be wondering, \u201cWhy would an employer pay to obtain employees? Sounds sketchy.\u201d Indeed, I\u2019d see your point \u2013 it does sound a tad sketchy at first glance. However, that\u2019s simply because these are call center companies, and the call center industry has an insanely high turnover. A lot of people just don\u2019t like call center work, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t work for you. Check out these companies\u2019 referral programs and see for yourself. 26. working solution This group is hiring people to do anything from tech support to customer service, to sales. They\u2019re also offering a pretty great commission \u2013 $100 per person! 27. call center QA Call Center QA is a company that works with telephone mystery shoppers. Basically, it means you\u2019ll be calling a store and pretending to be a customer, but really, you\u2019re gathering information to report back to Call Center QA. Kind of fun, like being a secret agent. The work is flexible and low-barrier to entry. They pay you via PayPal and give you $5 per referral. 28. liveops This is a call center looking for independent contractors who are willing to work from home (though, their company name sounds more appropriate for the secret agent work of Call Center QA.) The only requirements for working at LiveOps are an open schedule and the ability to commit to 10 or more hours of work a week. No word on the official payout for referrals. \u2013 Digital Services Referrals The explosion of the internet and the \u2018blogosphere\u2019 means that digital services are now their own, massive industry \u2013 and that means referral programs will come in tow! Some digital services reward you with monetary gains, some reward you with enhanced service. 29. dreamhost Let\u2019s kick off with DreamHost because they have a pretty cool system in place \u2013 you get your flat earnings in addition to another $5 every time one of YOUR referrals, makes a referral! Affiliate systems like this are pretty great since they allow multiple levels of reward to funnel back to you. 30. Groupon This one is really simple \u2013 get $10 in Groupon credit for every friend you refer. 31. Dropbox This revolutionary file-sharing service will reward you with additional space every time you refer a friend. 32. Hostgater Another great referral program that rewards you more the more people you refer. It goes up from around $50 a person to $125 a person later on, and that\u2019s nothing to scoff at! If you have an audience who will sign up, definitely get in on this ASAP. 33. Evernote Another service based reward, this time very simple: refer a friend and you both get access to the premium service. It\u2019s that easy! 34. media temple This referral program is another one that benefits all involved: For you (the referrer): Free hosting For them (the person you referred): 20% Off 35. Amazon prime The Amazon Prime referral program is kind of like a light version of the Amazon Affiliates program. You get $5 Amazon credit for each Prime member you refer who makes a $5 purchase. \u2013 Rewards Programs I saved this one for last since we\u2019re back to basics a bit. These are those classic GPT (Get Paid To) task sites that we all know and love. You may not know, however, that they are good for referring, too. Let\u2019s look at how some of these programs work to finish off our list: 36. opinion outpost This big-name reward site has two different ways to make money, and it differentiates between \u2018referrals\u2019 and \u2018affiliates.\u2019 At a glace: Affiliates go for a quantity approach. Any valid account that is registered from your referral nets you $1, whether they use the site or not. Referrals give you $2 per person, however, they\u2019re required to complete a survey first. Twice the pay, but you\u2019re banking on the idea that the people will actually use the site! 37. swagbucks Our old friend SwagBucks makes an appearance in the affiliate ring with their referral program. You can get 1000 SwagBucks per referral, which is roughly equivalent to $10. No limit on max referral numbers, so get the word out there on this (already popular) site and let the rewards come. 38. valued opinion This is a survey-exclusive site that wants people to give feedback on products and other consumer interests. You get $2 per person joined, on the stipulation that they first complete 2 surveys. 39. points2shop Here\u2019s another one of those multi-level referral types discussed before. You only make $1.50 per referral, however, you get a 15% cut of their lifetime earnings. Refer a handful of dedicated users, and you\u2019ll be sitting pretty! 40. survey savvy This site is a legitimate survey service that allows you to make between $3 and $20 per survey. Now, how does the survey reward tie back to you, the referrer? Well, you make a 15% cut on all lifetime earnings for your referrals, so those good rates are a boon for you. This online survey company is trustworthy and reliable, so don\u2019t worry about wasting your time by taking a chance on them. They\u2019re tried and true. 41. inboxDollars This is a well-varied GPT site that allows all kinds of tasks from videos to games and it\u2019ll reward you for all of it. A great site to spend your time in its own right, but you\u2019ll be even happier to know you can get 10% of the earnings for the tasks done by your referred members. Gather your video-watchers and your game-loving friends and refer them to InboxDollars \u2013 it might be the easiest money you ever make Final words If this is not enough for you Here my number 1 recommended strategy  FREE BOOK - DotComSecrets, The Underground Playbook For Growing Your Company Online...

            "answer_text": "Look around at what's in high-demand.  Ideally something in low supply too, but if as long as the demand exceeds the supply by a good amount, you can make some serious money doing it. Basic economics never lies.   My experience in high school:  Taught SAT/AP classes, taught chess classes.  I got paid 35-50/hr for all those jobs.  I held maybe 2-3 at a time.  I started teaching them because I needed money and I scored high enough on my tests to have other kids parents pay me.  All you need to do is get really good at dissecting down the topic into manageable chunks and teaching those chunks to kids.  You really only have to dissect them once and you teach all the kids pretty much the same thing after.  You can tweak it a little depending on the person.  Practice makes perfect and luckily, most people will pay you to practice on their kids.   I could ask for those prices because not too many people had the credentials I had and those that did rarely wanted to teach.  But every parent wants their kids to get higher SAT/AP scores and a lot want their kids to learn to play chess well.  I felt like Apple: I could charge basically any price.  I probably could have charged 75/hr, but the parents would start grumbling and I would actually have to put a lot more effort into teaching than I really want to.Also you can try internet marketing, watch this tutorial and start working. If you ever need money in a pinch, this stuff is like intellectual black gold. -Steven ",

            "answer_text": "If some one is following this question then most probably he/she would be an Indian, and if that\u2019s true, you need to know many things before knowing exactly the ways. Parenting or nurturing children in India means :- Giving them an extra comfortable life.Getting the students in the so-called best colleges (Narayana or Chaitanya) irrespective of the interest of their child.Getting them into a college paying lakhs of donation or in management quota just because it \u2018proves\u2019 their social status or they assume, it will give their child a bright career.And last but not the least , they prefer their children wasting time in wandering around the city or become extra active in social media than taking up a part time job.So first of all you should be ready to unfollow the trend. Secondly, you should be aware of the benefits of working as part time employee while studying. Not just monetary benefits to meet petty expenses, it is the skills which you will be learning which would be useful for rest of the life. You will be learning unconsciously money management as the money now is your \u2018hard earned\u2019 money.You will be very good at time management as you will have fix yourself into the \u2018new routine\u2019.You can either learn good behaviour or marketing skills depending on what you take up as the job.You will start respecting low profile employees as now you know they too are well-to-do and everyone\u2019s life is different. So you become more humble.You actually come out of comfort zone and face the real harsh world outside.You will get the exposure as you will now start interacting with many.And most importantly, utilising the time in something productive.If you don\u2019t learn these, you would not be able to lead a happy and satisfied life even if you earn lakhs in coming years. It\u2019s imperative to mention that, the parents in western or developed countries happily allow their children to become partly independent after their high schooling probably only because of the above mentioned reasons and Indians studying abroad take up jobs of delivery boys happily while hesitate to do the same in own country. Now coming to the actual answer. You can work in call centres soon after completing 10+2. They may offer up to 5k per month for working 5hours a day. You just need to have fluent English and a local language and more languages would be a bonus for you. This will further improve your communication skills.If you are good at typing, you can join the jobs of Data Entry which will fetch you 4K for working 4 hours a day. If not you can learn typing, it will hardly take 6\u20137 hours of practice over a period of 15 days.If you think you are good at marketing or you want to improve your marketing skills, join as a sales man in a company selling real good products like education materials. Though it\u2019s the most difficult job, physically and mentally, trust me, it is something which will teach you biggest lessons of your life, and make you prepared to face the slaps life\u2019s going to give in coming future.If you don\u2019t fit in any of the above or you want to know more ways, I would need to know what you are really good at, feel free to message or comment. Remember one thing, studying in schools/ colleges will make you an \u2018educated\u2019 person while life experiences will make you a \u2018learned\u2019 person. ",

            "answer_text": "Look around at what's in high-demand.  Ideally something in low supply too, but if as long as the demand exceeds the supply by a good amount, you can make some serious money doing it. Basic economics never lies.   My experience in high school:  Taught SAT/AP classes, taught chess classes.  I got paid 35-50/hr for all those jobs.  I held maybe 2-3 at a time.  I started teaching them because I needed money and I scored high enough on my tests to have other kids parents pay me.  All you need to do is get really good at dissecting down the topic into manageable chunks and teaching those chunks to kids.  You really only have to dissect them once and you teach all the kids pretty much the same thing after.  You can tweak it a little depending on the person.  Practice makes perfect and luckily, most people will pay you to practice on their kids.   I could ask for those prices because not too many people had the credentials I had and those that did rarely wanted to teach.  But every parent wants their kids to get higher SAT/AP scores and a lot want their kids to learn to play chess well.  I felt like Apple: I could charge basically any price.  I probably could have charged 75/hr, but the parents would start grumbling and I would actually have to put a lot more effort into teaching than I really want to.Also you can try internet marketing, watch this tutorial and start working. If you ever need money in a pinch, this stuff is like intellectual black gold. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, earning money isn't a big deal. If you are ready to do odd jobs then I have one for you. This is a simple business plan which you could execute during weekends and earn decent amount of money. The investment required is 200-500 rupees. Step 1: Go to a local wholesale store where you could get water cartons. Buy them worth 500 rupees. You'll get 4-5 of them. Also, try bargain. The money you bargained are the money you earned. Step 2: Go to some crowded place such as a bus bay or railway station. Sell your bottles for the MRP that is usually 20 rupees for a basic 1 litre bottle. So, after completing these two steps lets assume that you were able to sell 3-4 cartons that is basically 30-40 bottles. Also, you are working only for 3-4 hours.  Investment on buying the wholesale bottles: 10*50=500Profits when you sell your bottle at 20 rupees: 20*50=1000Money for other expenses such as travel: 100 rupees So, you can basically earn rupees 300-400 if you are willing to do this kind of a job. I am pretty sure that you wouldn't be able to earn this kind of money if you are working for someone. One benefit of doing this kind of work is that you would be able to understand the basics of business and entrepreneurship assuming that you have never done economics in your school. I hope it helps. At least try it out. I have tried it and trust me I was able to earn 5000 rupees a month with full dedication. Thank you! ",

If we do the job, we cannot go to college and if we go to college, then we cannot do the job, then in such a situation what should we do that we can earn money. Become an Influencer to Earn Money While Studying in College An influencer is a way by which we can earn thousands of rupees a month by joining affiliate marketing of any good company. Neither will we have to go in this nor can we do this work even when we are free and using our mobile phone. To become an influencer of any company, we must first go to the website of that company and create an account of affiliate marketing in which our sari will be detailed as to how much we have earned. So, we have to login after creating our account and then we can generate our referral link and we have to share the same link if anyone clicks that link then we will get money. If someone bought a product through your link, then it also gets the money. So this is the easiest way to earn money, in which we do not need to be told, students can do this work and even if the housewife does not delay, join a company soon. ",

Obviously, I don't do all of these at the same time.  Studying is a huge priority for me, and sleep as well.  Combined, I might work 20-30 hours per week, and I usually have control over how much work I accept.  It took me some time to build up my work schedule, so go at your own pace and only do what you can. ",

Also, paid internships are just a gimmick. You hardly save money unless they are International paid internships in reputable firms. If you have time, you can look for Teaching Assistant positions in your college/university and earn a decent pay monthly, which will incur your miscellaneous expenses.  If you want to lose money and play with your luck, invest in stocks. If you are actually interested in investing, learn about investment principles, take up certificate courses in BSE/NSE and then invest with your friends to minimize your risk. The odds of you making money is more, if you follow a more structured process in investing.  But the most important advise: Forgetting that you have to make money while in college, focus on learning to create or build something today which will impact thousands tomorrow and make millions in the future.

One should be able to earn $4,000 per summer, minimum.   Then during the Fall and Spring terms (roughly 15 weeks each), one could work ten hours per week.   I was able to work 10 to 12 hours per week, refereeing/umpiring the college's (MIT's) intramural sports.  I was paid Double the prevailing minimum wage.    Therefore, you should be able to make at least $2,250 per term or $4,500 per school year.   Adding that up, it should be \"easy\" to make $34,000 while in college (2015), during those four years, between a full time summer job, and a flexible hours in-term job. ",

If you do only Saturday-sunday job then join some food delivery boy job , uber-ola driver , call centre (you need to go daily) . Delivery boy , uber driver is good and flexible for student but you don't learn any skills from here. For passive income , you need some fund for website or blog making. You think what should you do?

There are lot of resources out there on internet to be freelancer and work for yourself.3) If you had any money you can try drop shipping which is very famous now a days, but you have to be careful choosing the products and how to market them. There are also lot of resources on internet that will help you to teach the basics of everything.***If you really need easy money i can only think of one thing, if you had little money try gambling and test your luck. Hope this helps and good luck if you prefer gambling (I wouldn't recommend it though.) ",

Their COGS (including labor, materials, and transport) was only about $75 per installation. They could charge so much was because my college had lots of impatient freshman with rich parents, and because they were the only students offering this service. Plus they were very outgoing and had no problem approaching strangers and propositioning them. Each year they grossed about $50,000-70,000 in just the first few weeks of school. So... you should look into that. ",

If someone throws up in the elevator at 3 AM, you have to go deal with it. If someone suddenly can't stand their roommate, you have to go mediate it.

The advantages of working in nightshift is, you have more free time to work on your own, and it usually less to do. Therefore, you can control the time much better, finish what it needs to be done, and use the rest to do homework and study for your subjects. It was not always going well as you would be very tired in the class, I was not an iron man, it happened to me too. I end it up skipping few classes and only managed to attend the afternoon classes. However, you need to find the line between it, you can also find some other side jobs that give you enough of money to survive.
