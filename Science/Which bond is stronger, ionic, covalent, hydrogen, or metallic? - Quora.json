            "answer_text": "Hydrogen are the weakest as they aren\u2019t bonds, they\u2019re attractions between a permanent dipole on a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom and another highly electronegative atom. This makes them easiest to overcome as it isn\u2019t a physical bond, just electrostatic. Hydrogen bonds differ to the other two greatly as they are intermolecular, not between lone atoms, this also means they only occur in molecules (covalent species) - NO other type of bonding The other three depend on the atoms in the bond, however, covalent are generally the strongest as they are the only physical bond. In regards to ionic and metallic, as they require ions for the attractions, smaller ions with larger nuclei are the best for these as they produce the most attractive ions overall. Otherwise they are very similar. hope this helps :) ",

            "answer_text": "Actually ionic, covalent and metallic i.e the intramolecular bonds as we call them are all considered to be strong . It is wrong to assume that one is stronger than the other . Usually what we do is to compare the bond in an ionic compound with another ionic or the covalent bond in a substance with another covalent bond in another substance but not ionic bond in compound with a covalent bond in another substance. When it comes to metallic bonds we do compare them in different metals. Hydrogen bond can be intramolecular or intermolecular. Generally they are weaker than intramolecular bonds. By the way all the bonds whether intramolecular or intermolecular are of electrostatic nature. ",
