The traditional product lifecycle can be referred to by this visual aid (from Wikipedia):  Depending on the product and the phase of it\u2019s lifecycle, the product can be considered to be located somewhere in that graph. A visual may help, I edited the graph above with a list of products in various stages of the product lifecycle:  The reason they are in those stages is determined by market adoption. For instance, virtual reality is still in an introduction phase because many industries are trying to discover how to best implement it; additionally, consumers are still uncertain whether to buy in to that technology yet. Wireless Ear Buds are in a Growth Phase - they are currently in market, and being implemented by early adopters. However, the news of airpods from Apple and the restriction of the headphone jack on the iPhone7 will created a spur in consumers requiring, or at the very least wanting, wireless earbuds. Microsoft Office Suite is in a Maturity Phase - Microsoft Office Suite is still one of the industry standards, and is striving to stay ahead of the competition in terms of Google and other SaaS companies. They are doing a great job, however, they are finding difficulty converting new users. College Textbooks are in a Decline Phase - The costs involved with textbooks have been obscene. And now with the advent of E-Readers and numerous online sources, college textbooks should face a heavy decline. They may get back into the maturity phase if they lower costs associated with ownership. Hope the quick rundown helps! ",
