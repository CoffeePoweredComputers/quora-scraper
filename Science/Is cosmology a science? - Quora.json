            "answer_text": "It is suggested that cosmological inferences should be tentatively made and sceptically received. Well, yeah. Or in other words, \"science\". Welcome to epistemology, circa 1920.  Much has been written on the Demarcation problem, and the difficulties of cosmology are always front and center. But so are the difficulties of many other sciences, including archaeology and astronomy, where you have to take what the universe gives you rather than being able to conduct experiments at will. I'd say that pretty much every cosmologist is well aware of this. As is, for that matter, the general public, who get continually frustrated by the sciences of medicine and nutrition, two other fields where we don't get to perform all of the experiments we'd like (due to practicality and ethics rather than due to fundamental limitations). They're used to science revising itself all the time, and have to be reminded that this how science works.  The real question of taking cosmology \"seriously\" is one of relevance. What in cosmology actually matters? It's not really applicable to anything. In pragmatic matters, the main thing it serves is to unequivocally dismiss pre-scientific ideas about how the universe formed, leaving people to wonder what other pre-scientific ideas are worth reconsidering. Cosmology is, without doubt, certain enough to say, \"No, we will not be teaching in schools any notions that revolve around the universe being 6,000 years old.\" Philosophical and personal implications of that are Your Problem. Beyond that, it's like any other science: we do our best with the data at hand, revising theories as new evidence comes to light. I don't really see why a 16 year old paper on a hundred-plus-year-old observation should be worth any further comment. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two broad styles of science: observational and experimental. You imply that only the experimental is legitimate science. Which writes off astronomy, palaeontology, and geology as well as cosmology. This is not so. The core of science is large amounts of data. Experiments are, of course, a good way of getting a lot of data. But large numbers of observations of the subject of interest are an equally valid way of collecting a lot of data. So cosmology, and other observational sciences, take longer to develop than most experimental ones. And confirmation of theories by further observations also takes longer. But that aside, the observational sciences are just as valid as the experimental ones. All it takes is the ability to make falsifiable predictions. Serious anisotropies in the CMB, serious deviations from the Hubble recession, would both act as challenges to cosmology. As long as such disproofs are possible, but not found, cosmology is a science. ",
