            "answer_text": "The answer truthfully is that no-one can really say. We monitor the half dozen or so volcanic sites with the potential for true greatness fairly closely and there\u2019s probably about a dozen more we either don\u2019t know about or are just sleeping on. Of those if I had to pick one, my gut feeling is that it\u2019s probably going to come from Toba. Just purely because of where it is geologically, so proximate to the Sunda Arc (any large earthquake here could disturb or re-activate the Toba system), the fact that in its history it has such a propensity for extremely violent activity and the great size of the magma system which underlies it. That\u2019s entirely a gut call, Yellowstone is far further distant from it's last great eruption (and therefore magma refill, magma phasing and volatile build up within the magma have had a long time to do their work; putting it closer to edge of glory) and a standout candidate but something about Toba makes me uneasy. It probably won\u2019t happen in our lifetime mind you. ",

            "answer_text": "No one knows.  I like the question though because it reminds me that Yellowstone National Park, when it blows, may well coat most of the US Midwest in feet of ash. That's where we get most of our food, and lots of us will die if it happens while we're living here.  All the snowplows in North America couldn't move  a pile of pumice the size of the Rockies and where would we put it?  Detroit?  It's not going to melt. What's interesting is that that volcano has erupted several times before, and the crater it's left is so large it wasn't even recognized as such until long after people started camping there, made it into a park, and wondered why so much of the groundwater there is boiling hot.  Its crater is too large to see when you're in it. Geologists say it has erupted roughly every 600,000 years, and it's been about that long since the last one.  Don't hold your breath. ",
