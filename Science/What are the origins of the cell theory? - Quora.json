            "answer_text": "The cell theory was first given by T.Schwann( german zoologist) and M.Schleiden( german botanist). They gave three points out of which only two were correct whereas the third one i-e cell is de novo structure, was incorrect. Then Rudolf Virchow gave the final point of cell theory which was that all the cells come from the cell division of pre-existing cells. ",

Every organism consist of cell.2 . cell is the structral and functional unit of organims.But they didnt clarify where does the cell comes from . which was later explained by R Virchow . He stated \" Omnis cellula -e- cellula\" which means \" cell arise from pre-existing cells.Hope this satisfy ur question\". ;) ",
