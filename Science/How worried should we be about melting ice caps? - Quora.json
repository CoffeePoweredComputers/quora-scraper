            "answer_text": "Pretty darned worried. There are worse problems associated with warming but the changes to the ice caps has two characteristics that make the problem important. The first is that the rate of sea level rise that results is not well predicted or understood. If large pieces of grounded ice break loose and start moving rapidly there is no impediment to relatively rapid and extreme changes - though there are LIMITS to them because the ice available to move rapidly in this manner is not the whole of the ice-cap. The most difficult are the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Between them they could raise the sea level a total of perhaps 14 meters - and even at the worst I can imagine this will take hundreds of years to do. The Ice Sheets are important because they don\u2019t have to actually melt entirely, to raise the sea level, all they have to do is break free and float. My SWAG (Scientific Wild-Assed Guess) at this is 1.7 meters +/-0.4 meters at the end of this century, and it will be changing very rapidly. I don\u2019t think rapid change is likely to start for another 30 years. I don\u2019t have a lot of faith in anyone\u2019s numbers at present, as nobody has demonstrated a good working model for the Ice. So worried about it I am - but not as much worried as I am about changes to rainfall and climate where we grow food. We should not be building permanent infrastructure where the oceans will re-claim it, but no society is more than 3 square meals from revolution. Someone else said that\u2026 but it points up that the real and immediate risk to our civilization will be the de-stabilization of our climate and the effect on the farmers. ",

            "answer_text": "Very interesting how successful the Climate Alarmists propaganda machine has been. Getting people to worry about a total non-event is pretty good marketing. First of all, of course, you have to make sure that nobody thinks about the fact that Siberia, North America and Europe were buried under a mile high continent wide ice sheet 15,000+ years ago, that has all melted away, and the sea level was 150+ feet lower back then. Secondly you have to make sure that nobody asks exactly how that much water could possibly be transported from the ocean to the poles when everyone knows that water vapor is created by heat and not cold. As it gets hotter the ice will continue to melt, temporarily, but then, the hotter it gets, more and more water vapor will be created and the planet will get a lot greener in the middle latitudes while the polar regions won\u2019t be able to burn off all the ice accumulated during the dark of winter. Eventually all the polar glaciers will merge into a continent wide ice sheet and have no place to go, except south, and Siberia, North America and Europe will once again be buried under a mile high continent wide ice sheet and the sea level will be 150+ feet lower. The ONLY significant greenhouse gas is water vapor. It represents 99%+ of all greenhouse gases while CO2 is not even 1%, or even 1/10 of 1%. CO2 is only 4/100 of 1% and yet, for some reason, the Climate Alarmists have everyone convinced that CO2 is the \u201ccause\u201d of Climate Change, and not the heat. Maybe they chose CO2 as the bad guy because they know that 97% of the population has never taken a physics or chemistry class and don\u2019t know the difference between essential carbon dioxide and deadly carbon monoxide, but it\u2019s more likely that CO2 was chosen because reducing the \u201ccarbon footprint\u201d is worth billions of dollars in carbon taxes. The more people they can convince that a climate apocalypse is right around the corner, the more people they can convince to accept a Carbon Tax on everything manufactured or transported. This tax will not do a thing to reduce the heat, but it will make the 195 signatories to the Paris Agreement, and their extended families, fabulously wealthy for doing nothing more than getting a \u201ccut\u201d of your carbon tax dollars. Bon apetit. ",
