            "answer_text": "What we need to question is bricks, concrete, glass, our table manners, our utensils, our tools, the way we spend our time, our rhythms. To question that which seems to have ceased forever to astonish us. We live, true, we breathe, true; we walk, we go downstairs, we sit at a table in order to eat, we lie down on a bed on order to sleep. How? Where? When? Why? Describe your street. Describe another. Compare. The French writer Georges Perec (1936\u20131982) was, to my mind, one of the most remarkable, stimulating and thought-provoking writers of the 20th century.  Perec was many writers. He was a novelist. He was an essayist. He was a poet. He wrote radio plays for German radio, even though French was his first language and he started out unsure if he even liked Germany and its culture. He pulled off an incredible feats of linguistic virtuosity, including one of the world\u2019s longest palindromes. He composed fiendishly hard crosswords. He spent much of his life haunted by depression, and his writing is a struggle against the void and silence and emptiness: he embraced constraints as a way of containing and incorporating the difficulty of writing anything at all, and yet his writing is full of life and detail and conviviality, and the celebration of friendship and fellowship. He rather half-heartedly attempted suicide, at one point (a friend met him the next morning and found Perec with bandaged wrists, and Perec smiled meekly and said I\u2019ve been a little bit silly); but although he died young, it was because of the cancer caused by his lifelong smoking habit. He spent the last years of his life happily in love and writing some of his best work. Like James Joyce, Perec stared bleak circumstances in the face, and instead of succumbing to them or moaning about them, he cracked jokes and told good stories and built a tower of words that was fit to live in.  Perec was born to a French Jewish family. His father was in the French Army and was killed during the German invasion of France. His mother was rounded up by the Nazis and died in the camps. Georges himself was taken in and adopted by his paternal aunt and uncle. He studied history and sociology at the Sorbonne, and began writing articles and reviews. In 1958\u201359 he did his national service in the French army, serving as a paratrooper. For a while he had a rather bizarre double life, being a soldier by day and then putting on his tweeds and hanging out in Parisian bars with his friends at night, discussing ideas and left-wing politics and being an intellectual. This became the background of his second book, Quel petit v\u00e9lo \u00e0 guidon chrom\u00e9 au fond de la cour? (1966), which I\u2019ll get to later. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. He came to adulthood in the 1950s, then, and the literary world of 50s and 60s France was high on an intellectual cocktail of left-wing politics and structuralism. Sartre still had his wits about him and de Beauvoir was active, but the real stars were people like Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan. These were the people that writers of Perec\u2019s generation grew up thinking of as the adults in the room; Perec\u2019s instinct was to simultaneously absorb their influence and take the piss out of them. He once compared them in a jokey newspaper article to pop stars, praising Lacan\u2019s latest hit \u201cYour unconscious is structured like a language, yeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d Perec made his name with the 1965 novel Les Choses: Une Histoire des Ann\u00e9es Soixante, translated as Things: A Story of the Sixties. The title was in part a sly joke about Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s 1964 autobiography, Les Mots (Words), which had been a major hit of the era. Things won the Prix Renaudot, and made Perec a minor literary celebrity, to the point that Georges Pompidou made a joke about him and his book: the then-Prime Minister of France asked somebody what this Perec fellow did for a living and, on being told that Perec worked as a filing clerk in a medical lab, Pompidou quipped \u2018Ah, I had a feeling that he wasn\u2019t too busy with Things.\u2019 He married teacher Paulette Petras in 1960. They separated fairly amicably in 1969, but never divorced. From then on, Perec lived on both his salary as an archivist in the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, and from his income as a writer. He never had children. He had a string of mostly unhappy love affairs (he thought he was small, funny-looking and unattractive) and suffered from depression in his 30s, but then in 1976 he met filmmaker Catherine Binet. They fell in love, and were very happy. I love the story of their first date: they were eating dinner in a Paris restaurant and Binet spilled some sauce on her dress. Before she had time to feel mortified about it, Perec grinned, reached down to his dish of skate in black butter, scooped up some butter on his finger and smeared it on his own shirt. Perec\u2019s biographer recorded that \u2018she had never known such charm.\u2019 He died from lung cancer in 1982.  David Bellos\u2019 magisterial biography of Perec is subtitled A Life in Words, and there\u2019s an argument to be made for Perec as the writer who, since James Joyce, has been most fascinated with and preoccupied by the most basic building-blocks of language: words themselves. Perec didn\u2019t discover his true voice, or rather voices, or rather space as a writer, for some time. He was fascinated with ordinariness. Partly out of the mid-20th century French left-wing \u2018critique of everyday life\u2019, but also because of his own perception of his marginality as a writer. He was small, Jewish and an orphan, and on more than one occasion as a child he ran away from home\u2014not to go anywhere in particular, just to get away. He was in analysis from an early age and recognised that he was very good at not telling his analyst what his problems were. Perec was both amused and pained that people assumed from his Breton-sounding surname that his family was from Brittany: actually, Perec had been his paternal ancestors changing \u2018Peretz\u2019 to make it more French-sounding. Perec shared the common interest in tales of travel and adventure, but he also advocated what he called \u2018endotics\u2019, the study of what\u2019s in your immediate environment, the opposite of \u2018exotics\u2019: what exactly is on my desk? What do I do every day? What are the things I take for granted, but which form the entire texture of the life around us? Perec\u2019s attitude was a bit like that of the singer in Talking Heads\u2019 \u2018Once in a Lifetime\u2019: How did I get here? Things crystallised his early interest in sociology. It\u2019s not so much a novel about individuated characters, as about what those characters want out of life. Hence the title \u2018a story of the Sixties\u2019: it\u2019s about the pleasures and frustrations of consumerism. The main characters, Jer\u00f4me and Sylvie, work in the then-thriving fields of market research and opinion polling and their main problem is that they never, ever feel like they have enough money. (To be fair, for most of the book they really don\u2019t have much of it.) They want to stand back from consumer society and criticise it like the good middle-class 60s French young people they are, but they also desperately want that new coffee table, enough money for a good meal with friends. Yet they find themselves scrimping coins to afford cigarettes. Jer\u00f4me and Sylvie are not shown in terms of being a couple with a dynamic relationship, but are a unit who want the same things as each other. They and their friends are seen as representative; this isn\u2019t a soap opera. Their longing for a better life isn\u2019t depicted as evidence that they are personally shallow or empty and materialistic: this is how a better life is represented to them by the world they live in. As Perec puts it with dry wit: In the past millions fought, and millions still do fight, for their crust of bread. Jer\u00f4me and Sylvie did not quite believe you could go into battle for a chesterfield settee. But that, Perec goes on, is nevertheless something that they would have felt like fighting for. Not better employment conditions or healthcare, but a round-the-world holiday or a really cool stereo. The characters are depicted as being representative of their generation, or at least of their immediate circle. This is even clearer in the original French, where the reader becomes aware from page one that the first half of the book is written in the imperfect tense, a tense that doesn\u2019t exist as fully in English as it does in French. Everything the characters do is represented as something that they \u2018would\u2019 do, i.e. in terms of their habits: the phrase ils auraient, \u2018they would\u2019, is all over the first few pages.  Towards the end of the book, when Jer\u00f4me and Sylvie\u2019s personal fortunes take a turn for the better, the book switches to the future tense, telling you what will happen to them, and this change in tense contributes to the peculiarly haunting quality of the last few pages. Things doesn\u2019t really have a narrative; it charts the rise and fall of Jer\u00f4me and Sylvie\u2019s frustrations and hopes, ending on an ambiguous note which reflects Perec\u2019s own identification of himself and his friends with his characters, but also an ultimate scepticism about whether the things they want are really worth having. Les Choses got Perec\u2019s name into the papers, and as usual with French intellectual life in those days, he was seen as part of a movement; the new \u2018sociological novel\u2019. What he chose to do then was, therefore, completely perverse. Quel petit v\u00e9lo \u00e0 guidon chrom\u00e9 au fond de la cour? (What wee moped with chrome handlebars at the back of the yard?) was a novella written about an anecdote dating from Perec\u2019s military service, when he and some friends had attempted to run a caper which would save a conscript from being sent to fight in Algeria. (Perec had a lifelong love of criminal caper stories, and wrote several of them.) Instead of being another sober sociological fiction, it was written in a bizarre, erratic, slangy version of French derived in part from Perec\u2019s love of the work of Raymond Queneau, the great poet, novelist, editor and polymath, who was rapidly becoming one of his main heroes and a close friend. Quel petit v\u00e9lo was greeted mostly with bafflement: Perec had entirely failed to do what he was supposed to do, namely, repeat himself. Perec\u2019s second novel proper, Un homme qui dort (A Man Asleep), came out of his experience of depression. Written in the second person, the novel describes the experiences of a young man who decides to let life go by and do nothing with it. He doesn\u2019t simply lie down and die. He goes about his daily routine, making his morning coffee, washing his clothes in his bedsit, going to university and at least pretending to study, coming home, eating the same dinner (steak frites) in the same cheap bistro every night. It\u2019s a haunting portrayal of deep loneliness. However, there was an invisible factor about the book which nobody recognised at the time. Perec wrote it by taking and discreetly adapting sentences from previous writers, until they all had the same \u2018voice\u2019. This picture of a solitary man is in fact built from the words of numerous other writers: it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to tell the story if it hadn\u2019t been told many times before. Un homme qui dort looks like a very personal piece of writing, and it was, but it was personal in the way that Perec\u2019s mature writing was personal: by brilliantly playing with the words on the page in ways that other writers don\u2019t, and achieving something which looked completely \u2018natural\u2019.  Perec\u2019s next novel, La Disparition (1969), translated into English as A Void, is his most notorious in that it\u2019s a lipogram, a text written without the use of a letter of the alphabet. In this, case the letter was \u2018e\u2019, in French as in English the most-used letter. This was not a mere stunt for Perec. He found that arbitrary constraints freed his imagination. Writing Things had been laborious for him, but once he started to use constraints in his writing he became more prolific. The most significant plot element in La Disparition is that, whenever a character is obliged by the story to use a word with an \u2018e\u2019 in it, they disappear. People disappearing had been a theme in his life. His father went to fight in WW2 and never returned. His mother had been taken away by the Nazis and never came back. The official letter reporting her death had been headed Acte de disparition.  Constraints gave Perec a kind of arbitrary power over his own work: it set a boundary to what was doable and not doable that didn\u2019t have to be justified. (Why write a novel with no \u2018e\u2019 in it? Why not?) I think that writing with constraints helped Perec to focus. Without them, the temptation to cram everything in, to try to write everything that was on his mind, was too great. La Disparition was greeted by French reviewers with wary admiration and, again, some bafflement, but Perec was most pleased by one reviewer, who completely failed to notice that the novel was missing the letter \u2018e\u2019. Although the review wasn\u2019t very complimentary and the reviewer had entirely missed the point, Perec took this to be justification that he\u2019d pulled off the lipogram so skilfully that someone wouldn\u2019t even notice that he\u2019d done it.  In 1967, Perec had become a member of Oulipo, the Ouvroir de litt\u00e9rature potentielle, the gathering of writers and mathematicians who liked to experiment with new ways of writing. Italo Calvino was also a member. Oulipo had been co-founded by Queneau and Fran\u00e7ois Le Lionnais, and Perec was one of its younger and most enthusiastic members. Perec had limited talent for mathematics but he was interested in it\u2014he was, by all accounts, very good indeed at his day job, which was basically analogue data storage and processing\u2014and he would become the member of Oulipo who was most determined to fulfil Queneau\u2019s injunction that it was all very well playing around with experimental methods of writing, but the real goal should be to create truly memorable literature using those methods. Queneau himself had composed Cent mille milliards de po\u00e8mes (1961), a short book containing ten sonnets printed on cards, with each line printed on a separate strip, like those kids\u2019 books where you can combine different animal pictures to make new animals. In Queneau\u2019s case you could combine different lines to make new poems, as each line made just as much sense before or after each previous or successive line of every other poem in the sequence, and they all had the same rhyme scheme. The result was that you could create [math]10^{14}[/math] poems, or 100,000,000,000,000, hence the title: One hundred thousand billion poems. Queneau calculated that if you were to try to read every single poem that it was possible to generate, and were prepared to spend 24 hours a day doing it, it would take you 190,258,751 years to finish it.  In the late 1960s, Perec started planning what would become his masterpiece, a novel that the great computer scientist Donald Knuth has called \u2018perhaps the greatest 20th century novel\u2019: La vie mode d\u2019emploi (1978), translated as Life A User\u2019s Manual.  Notice the French habit of declaring the genre of a book on the front cover. In this case, it\u2019s not Roman, \u2018novel\u2019, but Romans, \u2018novels\u2019.  La vie combined all of Perec\u2019s interests into the one book: An interest in the everyday: the novel is a description of what\u2019s going on in each room of a Parisian apartment block at the same moment in time;Stories and tales, in that each apartment comes trailing ample amounts of backstory to fill you in on who\u2019s who and what they\u2019re doing;A fascination with the artistic process, in the form of the wealthy Bartlebooth, who has filled in his later years carrying out an elaborate project to learn to paint watercolours from a skilled artist, then travel round the world painting 500 of them, have them made into jigsaw puzzles by a skilled craftsman, then assemble the puzzles, and then remove the paintings and bleach the colours out of them so that the whole project cancels itself out and it\u2019s as if it never happened;Arbitrary constraint, in the form of 42 lists that determined what objects and things had to be in each room of the block, as well as lists that dictated when Perec didn\u2019t have to follow his own rules, and a special chessboard move that dictated in what order the rooms had to be visited;A love of literary reference: one chapter is basically a condensed version of the entire story of A Man Asleep, or rather a slight variant of it;A fascination with consumer culture and things, in that the contents of the apartment block are lovingly detailed, and if someone\u2019s had e.g. a birthday party, you will know what they had to eat and drink.Most of the writing process of La vie consisted of Perec\u2019s creation of his own plan, and the resulting planning process itself; he did the actual drafting very quickly indeed, so quickly that his girlfriend Binet, after reading the first draft, said Georges, it\u2019s great, but you can\u2019t send this out\u2014it\u2019s full of terrible French. (The French can be quite firm about what constitutes \u2018good\u2019 French and \u2018bad\u2019 French.) Perec grumbled but redrafted it in accordance with standards of elegance and idiomatic correctness. The result is a big fat novel, but one that reads with great ease and speed, and conveys a very satisfying impression of coherence on more than one level\u2014because it is coherent on more than one level, but you can\u2019t discern what they all are. And as in all Perec\u2019s best work, life itself is seen to elude and exceed the most fantastically detailed plan. Bartlebooth\u2019s exercise in futility is itself doomed. There\u2019s more stuff going on than we can take in. Life A User\u2019s Manual is an experimental novel that reads like a classic one. Its structure is unusual, but transparent: every chapter is a moment in a room, frozen in time. It\u2019s comic and tragic, bursting with stories and not forcing them to make some kind of overall point. (Some of the situations are bizarre: in one apartment where a dinner party is being hosted, the guests are waiting patiently at the dinner table while the host and hostess are screwing energetically in the bath, being watched by their cat.) Out of the immobility of the instant that the book takes place in, lives and stories and family sagas go off in all directions. Life A User\u2019s Manual has nothing weird or difficult or self-consciously confrontational about it. The closest it gets to looking like an avant-garde novel is at its centre, where we find a list of pithy, one-line descriptions of each chapter in the book. On closer inspection, we find that each of these lines has exactly the same number of characters and spaces, and that the last letter of the first line is \u2018e\u2019, which is also the second last letter of the second line, and the third last letter of the third line, and so on, until it\u2019s the first letter in the line. Then the pattern recurs but with the letter \u2018g\u2019, and then all over again with the letter \u2018o\u2019. The word ego is thus built into this long list.  In the original, the letters are \u2018a\u2019. \u2018m\u2019, and \u2018e\u2019, which spell the word \u00e2me, \u2018soul\u2019. Writing this long list\u2014the soul of the book, if you like\u2014would have been hard enough in itself; translating it was an act of sorcery by David Bellos.  Perec wrote a lot of other things too. Species of Spaces was a short book about the different kinds of spaces in which we live, going from the area immediately around the writing desk to the world and the universe beyond. Perec was always fascinated by those inscriptions kids write into their books, when they give their address and go on to add their country, then \u2018The Earth, The Solar System, The Milky Way, \u2018The Universe\u2019.Je me souviens, \u2018I Remember\u2019, is a long list of apparently banal memories which Perec composed. Not ones which were personal and private to him, but which were his and also could have been anyone else\u2019s. For example, I could write such a list and include things like \u2018I remember the Cadbury\u2019s Icebreaker\u2019 or \u2018I remember the Dun Laoghaire-Holyhead car ferry St Columba\u2019 and somebody else might go Oh yeah, I remember that too.Experimental demonstration of the tomatotopic organisation in the Soprano (Cantatrix sopranica L.) was the only work that Perec wrote in English. It was a spoof scientific paper about the effects on a soprano of throwing tomatoes at her, which he composed in a deliberate parody of the grindingly bad English of French scientific researchers, complete with numerous citations to fictitious previous research on related subjects and snuck it into the archive of the lab where he worked to see if anyone would notice. It\u2019s now published as part of his works.Les Revenentes was his reaction from writing La Disparition. It\u2019s a short story in which \u2018e\u2019 is the only vowel. Perec pulls this off by numerous examples of creative misspelling, and it\u2019s based on a family story about the loss of some jewels, which winds up in a very funny and (for Perec) unusually explicit account of a wild pansexual orgy.W or the Memory of Childhood is his bleakest and most disturbing book. It\u2019s a mixture of a story about a disappeared boy and an account of a society, W, which is apparently based on Olympian ideals but which turns out to be a nightmarish dystopia in which starving athletes are forced to compete for food; the story turns especially gut-wrenching in its description of how the society treats women. It\u2019s basically an allegory for the concentration camps which his own mother died in. Perec had read and was affected by David Rousset\u2019s 1946 book about the camps, L'Univers concentrationnaire.Petit trait\u00e9 invitant \u00e0 la d\u00e9couverte de l'art subtil du go, co-written with Pierre Lusson and Jacques Roubaud, was an introduction to the ancient Chinese game of Go, which became an obsession for Perec and his friends in the 1960s.The Art of Asking Your Boss for a Raise came out of Perec\u2019s interest in data storage and computing. It began with a found object: Perec was asked by French computing researcher Jacques Perriaud to write something based on an actual flowchart which specified how an employee of a given establishment could ask their boss for a raise. Perec tweaked it a bit, and then wrote out the narrative of a nameless second-person character who laboriously goes through every possible loop in the flowchart in an increasingly darkly comic effort to get to his boss and ask him for a raise (in some versions of the loop, you do get as far as his office but you can\u2019t ask him for a raise because he\u2019s died from eating expired eggs).And then there are numerous articles, stories, crosswords, games, lipograms, palindromes and other things, many of which have been translated into English. On what would have been Georges Perec\u2019s 80th birthday, he got a Google Doodle, although it wasn\u2019t visible to much of the English-speaking world. In the end, except for readers who are as generally fascinated as I am with Perec\u2019s techniques, I suspect that most of his works will come to be regarded as planets orbiting the brilliant star that is Life A User\u2019s Manual, a book that everyone ought to read, in which Perec\u2019s interest in people and in stories was given full scope precisely because it was kept in such control by considerations of structure. One of my favourite of his shorter works isn\u2019t even a proper piece of writing so much as a transcript of something he said, at a meeting of the editorial committee of a journal he and his friends wanted to launch. The committee was endlessly deliberating over finer points of editorial policy when Perec spoke up, drawing from of all things his military service. He had trained as a paratrooper, and his unit, the 18th Parachute Regiment, was not the only paratroop unit to have served with some infamy in the Algerian War of Independence. Perec himself had been excused from going to Algeria because his father had died in the war, and like all French people of his generation with a conscience, he\u2019d been firmly opposed to France holding on to Algeria. Nevertheless, he drew on his experience of parachuting to explain, with characteristic fullness of detail, what he thought they needed to do. (I\u2019ve omitted a lot, including some of Perec\u2019s more specific remarks about the connotations of what it meant for him to be a paratrooper at the time that he was one): When you look at the eyes of the ones facing you, you realise that everyone has something in common, deep down, beyond their fear, beyond the fact that you know that they\u2019re fascists, you know that these guys are absolute bastards, that these guys are the dregs, you feel there\u2019s something in common, but you can\u2019t manage to define exactly what it is. Perhaps it\u2019s simply the fact that they\u2019re all in the same situation that you are, and that they\u2019re all going to have to jump out of the plane door when the moment comes. [\u2026] You may be obliged to feel trust at all costs, and that it isn\u2019t possible to refuse something. It isn\u2019t possible to say no. It isn\u2019t possible to take refuge, for example, in nihilism, or even intellectualism, no longer possible, even, to intellectualise. You\u2019re facing into the void, and you have suddenly to throw yourself out. Suddenly you have to refuse your fear. Suddenly, have to refuse to give up. And then? Then, you have to launch yourself. [\u2026] You had absolutely to launch yourself. It wasn\u2019t possible to do otherwise. It was necessary to jump, necessary to throw yourself out, in order to be convinced that it might perhaps have a meaning, might perhaps have repercussions you didn\u2019t even know about yourself. On the absolutely individual level, for me it had absolutely unarguable overtones. The fact that prior to 1958 I couldn\u2019t manage to accept myself, and that now, I am constantly managing it. That I couldn\u2019t manage to define myself, and now I\u2019m fully capable of doing so. [\u2026] The reason why we are all here, more or less, is that we\u2019re all participants in a review, and that the review has been searching for itself, searching for the last two years. That\u2019s my personal impression, and mine alone. I think it has to launch itself, has to accept to jump. That\u2019s all. ",
