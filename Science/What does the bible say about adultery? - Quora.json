            "answer_text": "I suppose you know that adultery is sexual infidelity to the marriage relationship, soi guess you\u2019re really asking one of the following questions. What actions rise to the level of sexual infidelity? How serious of a sin is adultery? The Bible initially sets the standard of sexual infidelity at physical sexual congress, commonly expressed as \u201cknowing\u201d or \u201clie together\u201d (nice euphemisms to clear everything up). The reliance on euphemisms indicates that it can be a sin just to think too hard about the subject\u2026ooops, but in the Old Testament this isn\u2019t regarded as the same as adultery. Jesus sets another line for \u201ccommitting adultery in your heart\u201d. It should be noted that \u201ccommitting adultery in your heart\u201d is probably about as similar to actual adultery as \u201csaying a silent thank you\u201d is to actually paying for something. However, it is certainly clear that being thankful for goods received is a usual precursor to honestly paying for them, and so to it is doubtful whether adultery often occurs physically before it occurs in the heart. \u201cThou shalt be grateful for every good thing thou receivest\u201d is a great precursor to keeping \u201cthou shalt not steal\u201d\u2026but it is not the exact same commandment. So, I\u2019m going to say that adultery is actual sexual contact with another actual person. But it is clear that one can sin well short of this extreme. For instance, a person seeking a degree of sexual titillation or emotional satisfaction outside of marriage may not be committing \u201cput away for the cause of\u201d adultery, but still be in serious need of repentance. So how serious a sin is adultery? It\u2019s basically \u201cyou just ruined someone\u2019s life\u201d serious. The Old Testament sanctions killing over it\u2026but the Old Testament sanctions killing over picking your nose on the wrong day (or something like that). But even Jesus is okay with casting a wife aside and thus denying her financial and social support and legal recognition as a human being. Ouch. I suppose there\u2019s supposed to be some penalty for adulterous men\u2026is it still just the killing? Jesus doesn\u2019t really say. So I guess the Old Testament is where it\u2019s at for the men. Okay, but like I said, Old Testament lethal sanctions don\u2019t really scale well. So let\u2019s think about this logically. What happens when you have sex outside of marriage? Well, you have kids outside of marriage, and they grow up without the appropriate relationship with both parents (and not just \u201cnot both\u201d, the relationship of a child to a single parent is really difficult for both, maybe better than no relationship at all with the other parent, but well below the relationship with a married parent). And it ruins lives. We know this, the science is very clear. When you commit adultery, it\u2019s basically like drinking and driving. It\u2019s not a \u201cvictimless crime\u201d, it just takes a while doing it before you actually see the blood in the streets. Yeah, people can live happy and fulfilling lives after you cripple them in a car \u2018accident\u2019 you caused for the sake of your own pleasure. That doesn\u2019t make it an okay thing to do. And not everyone goes on to live a happy, fulfilling life. Some do, some don\u2019t. Put it this way. Committing adultery in your heart is like getting wasted watching football on TV and sleeping it off on the couch. Not a great thing for your life, probably something you should think about changing, but hardly a terrible crime. Committing physical adultery is like getting wasted at a bar before driving home\u2026every weekend. Sooner or later you\u2019re going to ruin somebody\u2019s life for real. You might think you\u2019re being smart about it and nobody will get hurt\u2026you might even die before those odds catch up with you. You still played dice with someone\u2019s life. That\u2019s not a good thing. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, it\u2019s hard to say. It violates one of the Ten Commandments, but whether that counts as a sin is debatable. An argument can be made for Jesus breaking perhaps four or five of the Ten Commandments, and He was said to be without sin. He breaks the Fourth Commandment by permitting His disciples to work on the Sabbath by gathering crops, excusing that infraction by claiming that the Sabbath was made for man, and not man made for the Sabbath, turning the commandment upside down. He breaks the Fifth Commandment by back-talking His mother during the wedding feast at Cana, when she asked Him to turn wine into water, He replied \u201cWoman, what have I to do with thee?\u201d If I spoke to my mother with that kind of sass, she\u2019d whup me upside the head. He breaks the Eighth Commandment by instructing His disciples to take possession of two animals on which He would ride into Jerusalem during the week before Passover, on Palm Sunday, stealing them if necessary. He breaks the Ninth Commandment by telling His disciples He won\u2019t be attending the Feast of the Tabernacles, but goes there in secret and with great dramatic effect He reveals Himself and begins preaching. Jesus tells a parable about a beggar, Lazarus, who broke the Tenth Commandment by coveting the table scraps from a rich man\u2019s table; shortly after that in the story, the beggar dies and ends up in heaven. So, that doesn\u2019t seem to be any kind of sin that was punished. Further, Jesus absolves a harlot woman who was found guilty of breaking the Seventh Commandment by committing adultery, and grants her clemency from the punishment mandated by God Himself in the Old Testament. If the Apocrypha is to be believed, specifically the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, Jesus broke the Sixth Commandment by killing two of His playmates as a young child. So, whether breaking any of the Ten Commandments is a sin is up for discussion - it doesn\u2019t seem to be a sin when Jesus does it. ",
