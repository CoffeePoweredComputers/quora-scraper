            "answer_text": "Hello, I would like to keep my answer simple and straight. Firstly, improvement doesn't come easily, you need to work hard towards it. Now I can suggest you a way where you can work hard and quit instantly you will find the effect. I believe that you must have a chosen domain where you want to improve your scientific knowledge. The easiest way is to refer to the journals related to the field and discuss whatever you get to know from the paper with your professor or friends. If you do this, then firstly while reading the scientific journal you are gathering knowledge and while discussing you are sharpening your concepts and you might encounter new ideas too while discussion. If you complete a large number of journals, then after a certain interval of time you will find yourself in a strong position regarding the scientific field you have chosen to study and learn. If you plan to just know scientific works in general, then there are many online portals which feed you with daily updates. You can go through them and don't forget to discuss and enlighten about the knowledge you have gained with others. As sharing knowledge never reduces your knowledge but it increases your knowledge. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello! The easiest way to improve your scientific knowledge is to start studying something you already like. Let's say you like music, or already are a musician, you can study the science behind musical tunes and their effect on us, the varying tones and how each tone triggers certain emotions in humans etc. As you start exploring the subject you like in a scientific manner, you'll notice there are other aspects to it which are related to another field. The study of music is also tied to neuroscience at a certain level, as it deals with music's effects on brain waves(This is just an example) In its essence, all sciences are connected, and it's almost impossible to not come across some aspect of another science while you're studying your area of interest! As you study like this with interest and enthusiasm, you'll see yourself easily expanding your scientific knowledge and vocabulary. I could've easily suggested you to just buy random scientific books and read them but you wouldn't be able to do so, as even though you might have purchased some books, you would lack the devotion needed to study them. Once you approach learning in this way, it'll be far easier to learn any kind of scientific knowledge and you'll find your information base expanding at a rapid rate!! ",

            "answer_text": "It's very easy. You need only 2 things to develop your knowledge. Interest and reading source. 1)If you have a interest in scientific topics your knowledge will automatically develop. 2) For developing scientific knowledge reading is the best thing. Magazines such as safari , science city etc . If you are out of india then scientific American is the best magazine which will be very helpful to you. It was started before 150 years ago. These all magazines contains scientific articles based on research any phenomenon etc. But you can see everything surrounding you in different manner then it is an master point. For example we all saw that everything that is free will always fall down never goes up (unless it an helium ballon or something very light). We all never think why it is happening. That is the difference between any normal human and isaac newton who give the word gravity. I hope this answer will be helpful to increase your scientific knowledge. ",

Start from school books of any kid in 6th or 7th std when I was in 7th std I started to like science because there were chapters which are linked to our daily life and liking something is very important so as to continue it. When you will develop interest in science you will read more and more and your concepts will get stronger and you will develop scientific knowledge easily. Whenever you have a doubt clear it with the help of a mentor or just google it. There are many websites on web which are based on scientific stuff and they are really interesting. Whenever you feel like you are losing interest just change the topic. Science is a wide subject. If you are not able to study the stars and planets then study seeds and plants. Hope it helps ",

            "answer_text": "Scientific knowledge applied has helped humanity but theoretical knowledge alone cannot do good; so improving your knowledge means find technology for it so that humanity can take advantage of such knowledge and as you know knowledge is like a huge ocean and one may know in his life only little of it and the unknown remains what it was. Even known knowledge is not fully known and liable to change; what was once considered as Fact later on found to be Fiction or imagination, so be careful about such uncertainties in the field of science. Everything is relative in this world of ours including Truth; different people assert about it differently in different situations within their limited imperfect existence; there are religious views, philosophical views, etc. Science has also limitations as it depends solely on objective things and exclude the subjective factors involved in it, the inside knowledge powered by the soul of man. We have a wide reservoir of traditional knowledge and its usage in life. Scientists cannot ignore such things. They should probe on all such knowledge prevalent among common people all over the world and provide them with the scientific basis for it all because the traditional knowledge is spread over every sector of life enriching it from time immemorial.

Other than this, you are advised to see LOK SABHA TV channel in which many of the science programs are organised and casted. Not only this but also, you should see discovery and discovery science channel and should write the important scientific news on paper to make it as a draft file that will be act as a help for you. It will envisage for you to be always permanent knowledge because it will never fade away. This is how you can increase your knowledge. Thankyou Regards Lakshya kumar ",
