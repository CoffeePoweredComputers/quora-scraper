            "answer_text": "There are several methods to prevent aggreagation in general. Using a capping agent (as proposed PEG or others)\u2026 capping agent should be choosed according to your needs. Using very diluted solutions increase the time before aggreagation. This was the original attempt to create stable nanoparticles. If you create enough diluted solution the particles will not have chance to meet and aggregate. Such solutions have limited use but have advantage of having \u201cpure\u201d nanoparticles with unshifted surface states. ",
