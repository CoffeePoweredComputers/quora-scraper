            "answer_text": "Yes. Quantum Mechanics is the science that describes and explains the nature and behavior of matter and energy on the atomic and subatomic levels. The mechanics of these smallest constitutes of reality is quantum mechanics. The Uncertain Principle concerns how singular subatomic particles behave, mechanically. The Uncertainty Principle is erroneously often described as showing that there is an inherent unpredictability in the constructs of nature. This is false. There is nothing unpredictable or even uncertain about the \u201cUncertainty Principle.\u201d The principle is born of the quantum wave-function. And it states that any velocity or position of a particle (a quanta) cannot, by these mechanics, be defined more accurately than by an interval - as opposed to a bit or exact point. You could say that there is a fuzziness to the tiniest constituents of reality. They are not particles; they are kind of like \u201cpacked waves.\u201d That is the uncertainty principle. Relating this to the \u201cobserver effect,\u201d even a collapsed wave-function is still only a \u201cwave interval\u201d of our reality. Reality does not have particles-bits.  The principle is not that sexy or mystical; it merely tells us how nature is. We assume(ed) the tiniest of fundaments were particle-like when Quantum Mechanics taught us that this is not quite so. That is the core of the \u201cUncertainty Principle.\u201d As said above, neither \u201cwave\u201d nor \u201cparticle\u201d are good labels for the tiniest constituents of reality. Werner Heisenberg originally called it Ungenauigkeit (inexactness) or Unbestimmtheit (un-determinedness), whereas his mentor and collaborator Niels Bohr often used Unsicherheit (unsureness). Today in German, the most commonly used term for the principle is Unsch\u00e4rfe (blurredness or fuzziness), which in all respect is a better label, as uncertain it surely is not. I think perhaps the most common confusion with the principle is rooted in how a probability-wave-function can build certainty. Like a chair or a sandcastle - consisting of a gazillion number of fuzzy particles. It seems counterintuitive. But it isn\u2019t. An analogy I use is flipping a coin. They say the chance of heads is 50/50. However, flip 2 times, and you may find 100% tail. Even a 50/50 chance is quite uncertain. Flip it 10 times, and you may get 20/80. Still far from good enough. Flip it 100 times, and the chance will be perhaps 40/60\u2026 still not quite. However, do it a gazillion times, and the probability is exactly 50/50. This is how probability functions can produce certain results. This is how fuzzy becomes solid. Our reality is build-up of a gazillion probability functions.  ",

There's nothing at all quantum mechanical about uncertainty. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a feature of any wave equation when you don\u2019t have an infinite plane wave. Classical electrodynamics features one between frequency and wave number. Since quantum mechanics features a wave equation to describe matter, it has one too. In fact, it has a lot of them, for any pair of noncommuting variables. ",
