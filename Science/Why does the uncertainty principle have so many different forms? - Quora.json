            "answer_text": "The form you probably know is this: [math] \\sigma_x\\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}[/math]By definition [math]\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}[/math], so the fraction above may also be written as [math] \\frac{h}{4\\pi} [/math] Actually, this is only one instance of the generalized uncertainty principle, which is given by:[math]\\sigma_A^2\\sigma_B^2 \\geq \\left( \\frac{\\langle [A,B] \\rangle}{2i} \\right)^2[/math],where A and B are operators corresponding to observables, and [A,B] is the commutator (AB-BA). For position and momentum, this commutator is [math]i\\hbar[/math], and so the general principle reduces to the well known specific case. ",

            "answer_text": "There is an uncertainty relation between any two quantities that do not commute. Commutation is represented by this expression: [math] [A,B] = AB - BA [/math] where [math]A[/math] and [math]B[/math] are two quantities. If [math] [A,B] = 0 [/math] then we say that \"[math] A [/math] and [math] B [/math] commutes\". In classical physics, because all quantities are represented by real numbers, [math]AB=BA[/math] hence all quantities commute. In quantum physics quantities are represented by hermitian operators, which can be represented by matrices. [math] [A,B] = AB - BA [/math] is not satisfied by matrices in general hence there are as many uncertainty relations as there are non-commuting hermitian operators. ",
