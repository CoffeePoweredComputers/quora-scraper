            "answer_text": "Wolfgang Pauli said 1925, that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Let's first talk about electrons, and later on explain what fermions are. (the principe is the same as an electron is a fermion). We have a new model from out atoms. The nucleus stays the same (proton, neutron) but the way electrons behave and arrange themselves is different than on the models before. They have four attributes, four quantum numbers. The exclusion principle says that that every electron around an atom needs to be different in at least one of those four quantum numbers. The same goes for molecules when you have a few atomes together, but there you start having new things like molecular orbitales, which come from a linear combination of atomic orbitals.  Before I explain the four quantum numbers, it is important to know what \"quantum\" means. The values are quantifiable, which means that one quantum is the smallest amount you can have, and every other value is based on it. Take for example money. One cent is the smallest value you can have, and every other value is a multiple from one cent. The same principle exists in physics (e.g. plank values) The four quantum numbers are: [math]n[/math] is the principle quantum number. This describes the size of the orbital. Orbitals with [math]n = 2[/math] are larger than those with [math]n = 1[/math]. [math]l[/math] is the angular quantum number and describes the shape of the orbital. [math]m[/math], the magnetic quantum number describes the orientation in space of the particular orbital. So what does that exactly mean? The image explains it pretty well. The angular quantum number is named s (for a sphere), p (for a polar form), d and then f. There are even more complex forms than those on the image, but I hope that you understand what those quantum number mean.  But there is still a thing missing. [math]s[/math] is the spin quantum number. This says in which direction the electron is spinning (either clockwise or counterclockwise). It is not a \"real\" spin, because we can't represent electrons as small particles anymore, but I won't go into further details about it's nature. The spin can only have values of -1/2 or +1/2. Nothing in between. (thus quantum number). This allows us to have two electrons in the same orbital, with the same orientation and size.Let's add a a small bit about fermions.    We have a few elementary particles, and they can be divided in two. There are the fermions (green and violet) and the bosons (red, yellow). They come from two different equations and therefore have slightly different properties. The fermions all have spin 1/2 or a multiple of it. The bosons all have an integer spin. So all the fermions make up our matter, and need to be different in at least one quantum number. This explains why atoms have such complex structures and can be combined and behave the way they behave. Bosons on the other hand  make up the interactions. What we always called elementary force (something we can't see) is represented by the bosons. They can have the same quantum numbers, and this allows things like lasers (all the photons have the same spin) to exist. This was a brief introduction, there is way more to discover! Feel free to look around on Quora for other answers regarding this topic. Read a few answers about Quantum Field Theory, because this is pretty cool, if you're interested. Please note that I have no idea about what I'm talking. I haven't nor am I studying physics or chemistry. This is simple High School Chemistry with a few complements from Wikipedia and Quora. So if you find a mistake feel free to edit or leave a comment. ",

            "answer_text": "One point of clarification on Sandra's answer, at least as i understand it. The \"orbital\" space, or \"house\" as Sandra describes it, is defined not only by the fermions distance from the nucleus, but by the shape of the orbit (meaning the shape of the space in which the electron is likely to be found), and it's orientation. So two fermions with the same spin and distance could exist if their orbital space has a different angular orientation, for example. Earlier notions of quantum descriptions, which was the way I first learned them, defined these limits with the concept of \"shells\" which would basically represent a distance quantum. The number of electrons in each shell was limited. It wasn't clear then what limited them, we just understood that there could only be a certain number of them occupying the same orbital distance, and that they they did not interfere with each other (occupy the same space or collide, if you will). The current set of characteristics tries to further define what that means while encompassing Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that electrons (now all fermions) do not move in a specifically defined path (e.g. a circle).  The problem with that notion was if all the electrons within the same distance (same quantum n number) moved about erratically with no other constraints, they would eventually \"collide\", but they don't. To resolve that, it required a refinement that could define the limits of the uncertainty. The additional characteristics of shape and orientation provide a mechanism that allows us to define a specifically defined space unique to each fermion and thus limit it's motion such that collisions do not occur.  All that's needed to uniquely define that space is for one of the four quantum characteristics to be different. Think of each fermion as having an intelligent 4 digit zip code where each digit has a specific defined set of values possible; distance, orientation, shape and spin. Each fermion has to exist in it's own unique zip code.  This is more an analogy than a true physics description and I am sure my limited understanding leaves a lot to be desired. But there are only 3 answers, including mine, so far. Hopefully, more actual physicists will chime in with more accurate, but easily understood explanations, and you can ignore mine. ",
