            "answer_text": "Actually, it is very much not \u201cdead easy\u201d as the other answer claims. First, you have your BMR, the amount of calories you burn at rest. This alone can vary 20\u201330% from predicted amount or more. That\u2019s several hundred calories per day. Then you have movement. That\u2019s also going to be really difficult to predict, and something like a fitbit is actually highly inaccurate.  Why? Because when you do a lifting set, your heartrate goes up a lot, but there\u2019s not a proportionately high number of calories burnt. It\u2019s a bit like if you are afraid\u2026your heart rate goes up, but you aren\u2019t actually burning that many more calories, as your body isn\u2019t actually doing much more physical WORK.  A gitbit, essentially, counts everything as cardio, and thus can be quite a bit off. Furthermore, it counts things as steps that most certainly are not steps. It even counts heart rate based on factors like your arm moving! If I sit in a chair and move my arm back and forth quickly in a running movement, I can pump my \u201cheart rate\u201d up to above 160 beats per minute, when in reality it\u2019s still below 60! Even just using the internet to predict calories you burn ain\u2019t a walk in the park, and the inherent variation between humans can be way off from different activities, even if you time and measure them correctly. Also, your online calorie calculator probably ignores something called the \u201cthermic effect of food\u201d. This is how much energy is required by the body to break down the carbs, fats and protein and assimilate them into the body. Nothing is free. Even water takes energy to heat up to the temperature of the body, to the tune of 46 calories per liter of cold water.  Something called NEAT is also a big factor. This \u201cNon-exercise activity thermogenesis\u201d is basically just movement that isn\u2019t exercise. This has a HUGE amount of variation, some people literally fidget away thousands of calories per day. You probably know the type\u2026foot tapping, highly animated talkers, those who are rail thin despite eating everything in sight\u2026this is very difficult to predict. Finally, body composition can be massively influenced by factors like training, hormones, sleep and protein composition of the diet. Two people could eat at maintenance calories, and one could gain muscle and lose fat, while the other could do the opposite.  So, in summary, you don\u2019t know how many calories you are burning. You need to combine calorie counting with something else, otherwise it is patently useless as a means of losing weight. Here\u2019s a YouTube video discussing this very topic, and the inherent drawbacks in trying to exactly measure your caloric expenditure.  It\u2019s not easy trying to predict and add everything up, but then again, this isn\u2019t a math equation. This is life. Follow me on Instagram or YouTube for diet and training tips! ",

            "answer_text": "How many Calories do we burn a day? This varies wildly from person to person. Caloric expenditure can be broken up into three different groups: Basal Energy ExpenditureActivity ExpenditureThermic effect of foodBasal Energy Expenditure (AKA, BMR or RMR (Resting metabolic rate) This is how much energy your body requires to stay alive. You'll burn these calories even if you don't move voluntarily at all throughout the day. The main organs in your body that require energy are your brain, liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, and soft tissue maintenance (Muscle and fat). The general break down (these are estimates that change from person to person) of the energy used per system are: Liver - 27%Brain - 19%Skeletal Muscle - 18%Kidneys - 10%Heart - 7%Other organs - 17%From: Basal metabolic rate There are dozens of formulas out there to calculate this for you. They're extremely generalized based on your gender (which makes assumptions based on muscle and fat content) height, and weight.  Some factors that can influence your BMR include: Lean mass - the more muscle you have the more calories you burnFasted state (your body will gradually use more energy for a period while fasting, then crash suddenly after 3 days)Thyroid activityActivity Expenditure This is what calories you burn by what you do. How much you burn depends on how much you move. The more you move, the more you burn. There is a book scientists put together after analyzing various activities that indexes them based on intensity for you to make calculations based on your own weight to see how much you're burning: Compendium of physical activities: classification of energy costs of human physical activities. Thermic Effect of food This is an effect that can kind of be lumped into your BMR, but it's different enough. Every time you consume food, energy is expended to digest it for use. This isn't a huge expenditure, but it's something. There's no such thing as a \"negative food\", or a food that burns more calories to digest than it provides you, but by picking certain foods, you can limit the number of calories your body actually utilizes.  Factoring these three things together you will see how many Calories you burn in a day. The only way to really have an exact count of how many calories you burn is to stay in a chamber where they can measure how much heat your body radiates, or carry around a metabolic cart with you that measures the difference in O2 and CO2 you inhale and exhale. You can get a pretty decent estimate from online calculators, but know that nothing is constant and messing too much with your bottom line could cause your daily expenditure to plummet. ",

            "answer_text": "Wareable technology like the apple watch, fitbit and jawbone as well as more old school tools like pedometers and HR monitors can all help you gauge whats being burned off by your daily movement. However most of these tools all look at HR and steps alone. Activity like hiking, biking, skating, weightlifting, roller blading etc\u2026 are not very well tracked based on how they measure movement. Some come close but none are exact. In fact many are pretty far off when tested in the field compared to a laboratory measure. Measuring what your putting in your body is done by logging your every bite and sip of food and drink. You have to be honest and accurate with what you report and log or the outcomes looses integrity and accuracy quick. Assuming you do that well, using apps like my macros plus or myfitnesspal to log your intake you can gauge where you are day to day and week to week averages. Some apps even have corresponding apps that allow both calorie intake and activity tracking for a wide range of sports, exercises and activities. But again, not all are perfect. The whole science of tracking calories in and out is far from perfect and has loop holes on both sides. Its not a bad practice to have as it does help make people more aware of what they do day to day. Look at this article from Precision Nutrition and give it a good look. It explains why getting too caught up in calorie tracking can often times not be worth the stress of getting very picky. ",
