            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \u201cheat.\u201d The way that most people use the word, including the discharge phases of proestrus, estrus, and diestrus. Each of those phases lasts \u201cmore or less\u201d a week in most dogs - three weeks total where there may be discharge and where she will be attractive to males. However, only the middle part - the estrus - is when she will accept mating and can become pregnant. BUT\u2026 because a dog\u2019s cycles are not going to be identical across dogs, or even two cycles in the same dog, wisdom dictates that the female be carefully confined as if she was in estrus from the first sign of swelling/discharge until at least three weeks have passed and she has no visible signs of being in heat remaining.
