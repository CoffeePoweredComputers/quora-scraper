            "answer_text": "Not entirely sure what you mean by scientific names, but in general, if scientists come up with a name for something it\u2019s to avoid confusion. Sometimes, e.g. in medicine, the names allow doctors and scientists to talk about something without a dictionary and avoid confusion. In biology every animal has a specific name, because a biologist needs to be specific, and translation is difficult and imprecise. In physics, never before seen (known) \u201cthings\u201d need to be described, so they get a name. In astronomy, not all stars are the same, so they have categories with names, because a red dwarf is really different from a yellow dwarf. Take maths for example, instead of just special names, it has a whole new special language with symbols and meanings where a single line that looks like gibberish to a non-mathematician would need anywhere between a paragraph and a page to explain in plain language, and some people would still get the wrong idea. But to anyone versed in Math-speak, it\u2019s 100% clear, and it has one and only one meaning, whereas in English, there are thousands of jokes that are built on the confusion of meaning, double meanings and a single word meaning more than one thing. In science, people want and need to be clear, otherwise, what\u2019s the point? If you mean something else, please be more specific. ",

            "answer_text": "If you ever get interested in something like spiders you will find that people call different kinds of spiders by the same name (e.g., banana spider), and call the same kinds of spiders by different names. Nobody knows for sure what is going on unless they can see the actual spider and then sometimes they will be confusing two species without knowing it. So a system got set up that tries to give every species of creature a name that makes sense, and they police the use of these names. Every once in a while the names will be changed because, for one thing, two different species of spiders might have been being treated as though they were the same species and then somebody did their genomes and found significant differences.
