            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a trigonometry issue. If you see something moving left to right at 1 meter a second and it\u2019s 1 meter away, it\u2019s moved about 60 degrees or so across your field of vision (which is quite a bit considering humans only have about 170 degrees of field of vision) If that same object is moving left to right at the same speed, but 100 meters away, it\u2019s crossed a much smaller part of your field of vision in one second. It\u2019s going to take it close to a minute and a half or more to cross that same 60 degrees of view. ",

            "answer_text": "Its all the play of angular displacement. For a given(fixed) arc , the angular displacement(denoted by theta) is dependent on the radius of the circulation ( in this case it is the distance of the heavenly body). As the distance increases the angular displacement decreases. That's why faraway objects seem to be moving slower.  ",
