            "answer_text": "The big problem with answering \"what does an atom look like\" is that in order to look at something, we normally shine light on it and observe the light that bounces off. Visible light has a wavelength that is much bigger than atoms. It is impossible to make out small details of objects by probing them with waves of large size -- the waves simply flow around the small object. Shorter-wavelength light may be used, but the energy per photon increases as the wavelength shortens. As it turns out, when the light has a wavelength comparable to the size of the atom or smaller, it has enough energy to change the atom by moving the electrons around. This is one consequence of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. We cannot say where the electrons are and how fast they are moving at the same time, and hence we cannot draw a picture with a little electron on one place sitting on a circular orbit. The fuzzy picture at the bottom of the page linked to is closer to the truth, describing the probabilities of finding electrons, depending on where you look for them. The nucleus, containing protons and neutrons, has a similar problem, but it is much much smaller than the electron cloud, and hence the energy of a photon needed to resolve structure is much higher. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle applies to neutrons and protons as well, and so a fuzzy nucleus isn't such a bad representation either. But for show in a classroom, the clear pictures showing the details get across the important points that atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons, that the protons and neutrons are in the nucleus and the electrons are found at larger radii. source:-Q & A: What does an atom look like?

            "answer_text": "We know somewhat about atoms, yet not it's exact shape.We know that atoms have a nucleus: Geiger\u2013Marsden experimentThe Oil drop experiment showed the charge of the electron.The Proton was also found as part of the atom.And in the early twentieth century there was the Discovery of the neutronThese components are confirmed by scientific research. The actual looks of an atom is a very different story. This is something we don't know because the electron cannot be placed in a fixed place or a fixed orbit around the nucleus. And the nucleus is composed of various even smaller particles so we don't know the exact looks of the atom. A model, a simplification of reality, is often used to represent an atom.One like this:  This is not what an atom looks like, it's a model to explain the atom (helium in this case).It's mainly the position of the electrons that's uncertain, it's probability is somewhere around the atom's core where it's more likely in the darker than the lighter part:  This image shows the individual atoms in gold:  That's the closest we get to this point, some internal parts that are confirmed and images from very strong microscopes that show the surface, the color of gold as in the picture above is determined by the movement of the electrons.
