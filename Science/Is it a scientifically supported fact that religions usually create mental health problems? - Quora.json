            "answer_text": "Original Question: Is it a scientifically supported fact that religions almost always create mental health problems? No, it isn\u2019t. New Atheists like to crow about how religion is inherently unhealthy for the mind, but I have never read even one of these clowns even try to back up such claims with findings from the social sciences. What is more, almost everyone on Earth follows some religion or other. In what clinically useful way can we define the vast majority of people as mentally ill all and only on account of a nearly universal practice? Another bad New Atheist habit is conflating conservative Christianity with all Christianity with all religion. If one religion is mentally unhealthy, that doesn\u2019t mean that all the others are. It should be obvious that the mental health of LDS fundamentalists\u2019 \u201clost boys\u201d rests on shakier ground than the mental health of most Wiccans. tl;dr No, there is no scientific evidence that the practice of religion per se almost always creates mental health problems.

            "answer_text": "No, that's an overly general statement. I think to some extent it depends on how seriously you take your religion. Religious fanatics in my opinion tend towards the mentally unstable. But it's a moot point as to whether the religion causes the instability, or the instability itself leads to people choosing a particular type of belief. People who are moderately religious often get the benefits of a community and friendships. That can be a plus in the mental health stakes. Unfortunately the excessively religious often try to pin mental health problems on atheists. Without a great deal of evidence to show it. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I am areligious and an atheist. I have never heard of your statement. Some people can benefit from being with people that share their religion. This can help some people cope with illness by feeling like they belong. Some people can talk to supportive pastors. In grad school, my favorite professor said that in the grand scheme of things religion can do positive things and horrible things. Some people with delusions may have religious delusions, some people may use religion as an excuse to hurt others in their family, but in general, I have not seen any evidence that religions almost always cause mental health problems.

There is but one religion, the religion of Truth. There is but one error, the error of self. Truth is not a formal belief; it is an unselfish, holy, and aspiring heart, and he who has Truth is at peace with all, and cherishes all with thoughts of love. ",
