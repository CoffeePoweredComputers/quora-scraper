            "answer_text": "Alkali metals The alkali metals, found in group 1 of the periodic table, are highly reactive metals that do not occur freely in nature. These metals have only one electron in their outer shell. Therefore, they are ready to lose that one electron in ionic bonding with other elements. As with all metals, the alkali metals are malleable, ductile, and are good conductors of heat and electricity. The alkali metals are softer than most other metals. Alkaline earth metals The alkaline earth elements are metallic elements found in the second group of the periodic table. All alkaline earth elements have an oxidation number of +2, making them very reactive. The Transition metals The 38 elements in groups 3 through 12 of the periodic table are called \"transition metals.\" As with all metals, the transition elements are both ductile and malleable, and conduct electricity and heat. Their valence electrons are present in more than one shell. This is why they often exhibit several common oxidation states. Other metals The \"other metals\" elements are located in groups 13, 14, and 15. While these elements are ductile and malleable, they are not the same as the transition elements. These elements, unlike the transition elements, do not exhibit variable oxidation states, and their valence electrons are only present in their outer shell. All of these elements are solid, have a relatively high density, and are opaque. They have oxidation numbers of +3, \u00b14, and -3. Metalloids Metalloids are the elements found between the boundary that distinguishes metals from non-metals. Metalloids have properties of both metals and non-metals. Some of the metalloids, such as silicon and germanium, are semi-conductors. Non-metals Non-metals are the elements in groups 14-16 of the periodic table. Non-metals are not able to conduct electricity or heat very well. As opposed to metals, non-metallic elements are very brittle. The non-metals can be gases, such as oxygen and solids, such as carbon. The non-metals have no metallic luster, and do not reflect light. They have oxidation numbers of \u00b14, -3, and -2. Halogens The halogens are five non-metallic elements found in group 17 of the periodic table. All halogens have 7 electrons in their outer shells, giving them an oxidation number of -1. The members the halogen family go from gas->liquid->solid at room temperature as you descend the group Noble gases The noble gases are found in group 18 of the periodic table. These elements have an oxidation number of 0. This prevents them from forming compounds readily. All noble gases have 8 electrons in their outer shell, making them stable and highly non-reactive. Lanthanide Series The Lanthanides consist of the elements in the f-block in the sixth period of the periodic table. They are soft metals, all naturally occur except for Promethium Rare earth elements which are useful for their metallurgical properties in alloy form are composed of the lanthanide series plus Scandium and Yttrium. Actinides Series The Actinides series consist of the elements in the f-block in the seventh period of the periodic table. All the elements of Actinides series are radioactive and most are synthetic, that is, human-made. All have a silvery or silvery-white luster in metallic form. ",

            "answer_text": "You might have visited your school library or any public library. Suppose you are in immediate need of a particular book, you know what you are seeking for is in the book. Now suppose you go to the library and find each and every book has been placed in a big hall. No arrangement and no order. All you can see is heaps of books. How would you feel?May be a bit disappointed and if you might be wishing everything should have been arranged in a particular pattern. And I am sure you are hard working enough to put all books category - wise in their correct shelves. Similar task was also needed in chemistry when more and more elements were being discovered and an arrangement was required to keep them in groups. The required hard work was done by Mendeleev and it led to formulation of first periodic table. Later on modern periodic table was also prepared with only one purpose: To keep elements in groups so that it would be easy to study them at once. Now what has to be basis of making such an arrangement? It was done with the aim to keep all elements having similar properties to remain on same group. It reduces our work to study elements in groups rather than studying each and every element separately. ",
