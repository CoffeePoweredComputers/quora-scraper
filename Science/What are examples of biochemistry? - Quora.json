            "answer_text": "Biochemistry is any process that can be related to chemical reactions and living things. For example, The human body and muscles. Biochemistry studies how certain molecules will react to the energy molecule: ATP to make the muscle contract and produce movement. Another example can be of how we can maintain things alive such as bacteria, archae and even animals. With biochemistry we can \"measure\" their homeostasis capacity like pH, climate or nutrients to make sufficient enough to live. ",

            "answer_text": "A very broad question. My favorite example is that of enzymes. Enzymes are biological catalysts which speed up the rate of biochemical reactions many-fold that would otherwise occur so slowly as to not be able to keep up with the demands of metabolism. One of the fastest enzymes known is Catalase which drives the biochemical reaction in which hydrogen peroxide is decomposed to water and oxygen. Catalase can accelerate the rate of this reaction up to one million-fold. ",
