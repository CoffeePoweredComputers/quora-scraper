            "answer_text": "Carbohydrates can be represented by the stoichiometric formula (CH2O)n, where n is the number of carbons in the molecule. Therefore, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. Therefore in all carbohydrates, the hydrogen to oxygen ratio is always 2:1. ",
