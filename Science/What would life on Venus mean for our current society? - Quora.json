If they aren\u2019t much developed and are rather a cellular organism , then they would create the most advanced probe they can make and then start preparing its launch as soon as possible.  This means that life on Venus makes the belief of life on other planets even more bolder. Humans have been spending money and time all in vain until now. They get to know about life on Venus , then they would boost their development on this sector much more. Spending more money , manpower , and intelligence. And if we find life on such extreme conditions , then scientist can believe that there could be life on other 7 planets as well. And then there are billions of galaxy still left to explore.  ",

            "answer_text": "Because so few people pay attention, not much. Because it would have no impact on our daily lives, essentially none. How many people care whether or not some strange bacteria live in the sulfuric-acid clouds of Venus? (There are NONE in comet tails.) A large number of scientists care a great deal. Some science-fiction writers will have fun with this. The rest of us will continue with our normal lives. I have been predicting life in Venusian clouds and deep Martian rocks for some time now, although I hedged by remarks. If, as I think, life is a cosmic imperative, then it just makes sense. If life develops only rarely on suitable planets, then I am wrong. The discovery of life (not simply indications of life) on Venus and Mars would strongly support the concept of life as a cosmic imperative. PLEASE NOTE WELL. Life as a cosmic imperative would not mean space aliens all over the place. ",

            "answer_text": "Microbial life, at least, on Venus now seems much more likely. The knowledge that even the closest planet to our own probably contains life should give us pause. If life can exist so nearby, and prosper under the harsh, super-acidic conditions of Venus\u2019 upper atmosphere, it may well be present in a great many places. If this is so, then, in many instances this life may continue to evolve, and eventually assume an intelligent form. We begin to see firm, real evidence that we are not alone in the universe. ",

Mars will be second after Earth. Venus three. Maybe Ceres as our fourth kill? then Europa & Enceladus & finally Titan. i am dubious about any chance of life being discovered on or in Triton or Pluto? even if non-Earth life is NOT found? we can still take pride in our ability to pollute & poison & contaminate any possible life in the future. anyone keeping score?
