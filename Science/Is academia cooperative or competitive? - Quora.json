            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Jessica.  Like most other large social environments, academia is a mix of cooperative and competitive situations.  In my experience/area (computer architecture and compilers), academia tends towards \"gentlemen's agreements\" rather than free-for-alls, because of the need for cooperation: those that treat the situation as purely competitive can find themselves shut out of opportunities.  One of the primary drivers of this in my area is the program committee for conferences: people agree on what to accept for publication, and if you piss too many people off, they may cooperate to shut out anything borderline of yours. On the cooperative front: it's rare that an academic comes up with publication-worthy ideas on his/her own.  It has been uncommon for centuries: legendary scientists have been studied via their correspondence with others, rather than just their papers, and some famous scientists have a reputation for stealing or not attributing ideas they obtained via correpondence.  Regarding citations, there are a couple reasons to cite: To connect past ideas to one's own, and help researchers who aren't familiar with one's work (which is most people reading the paper).To call attention to important works: this effect is why professor track the number of times they're cited.To \"grease the wheels\": sometimes there's a more tenuous relationship with past work, but the faculty member of that past work is a friend or a program committee member whose ego needs to be assuaged.Thankfully, I've never felt like I've had to do the latter, but I also didn't have enough publications of interest for professors to urge me to go into academia, unlike some of my seniors. One point: the enhancement of an academic's own prestige is generally tied to institutional prestige, and vice-versa: it's at least a partially cooperative action.  Professors don't move around so much that the two are independent, even for professors that have effectively unlimited mobility (e.g., have Nobel Prizes).  I believe this effect is actually more clear at universities which are well known for research but less so generally, particularly my alma mater, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  According to professors who had offers from other highly prestigious schools, one of the primary reasons they came to UIUC was for a much more collaborative environment, and we hung onto some very renowned professors because of the environment and the built-up prestige (e.g., the inventor of the transistor/discoverer of a theory of superconductivity, the inventor of the LED, inventor of MRI, and so on).  Berkeley and Michigan had highly collaborative environments as well, judging from my interactions with them.  I didn't work very much with other schools. Regarding competition: my advisor, who is reputed for his ability to get large funding grants, once likened the act of getting professors to cooperate to herding cats.  Ultimately, rising in status means exceeding your peers.  So there is always an element of competition in academia.  Competition also drives people when a purely collaborative environment would encourage complacency.  Some people choose not to play the game, and people often operate by different metrics (funds raised, students graduated, papers published, papers cited, industry influence, etc.), so the competition in academia doesn't get as back-stabbing as some industries.

            "answer_text": "BOTH. Academia is BOTH  cooperative AND competitive. The pursuit of knowledge  should be cooperative, But being competitive is normal  survival estinct. it's when people become obsessed  with themselves and their egos  and they become obsessed with just getting the credentials rather than actually DOING THE WORK  it takes to establish credibility, both personal and professional, and Ethics and morals and the social contract are ignored is when the competitive  person becomes pathological and abusive. Competitiveness and cooperation are two sides of the same coin, the search for knowlege , just like Scicnce and religion and faith are two  sides  the  search for knowledge. you cannot have one without the either. The reasons you cite  people is for BOTH REASONS. If you have NO PERSONAL ethics or morals, then you have a big problem, anger, hatred of yourself and everyone else, pathological jealousy  and envy.
