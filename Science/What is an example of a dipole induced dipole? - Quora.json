            "answer_text": "The easiest example is a magnet inducing magnetism a piece of iron. A magnet is a dipole with north and south poles. In the electrical world you can think of a capacitor as a set of dipoles. If you keep another polarisable material between the plates of a charged capacitor the material gets polarised due to electric field. ",

            "answer_text": "When the electric field due to a dipole induces separation of charges in a non polar molecule, such that the non polar molecule becomes a dipole itself, then such interaction is called dipole induced dipole, the dipole so created will also have a field of its own ",
