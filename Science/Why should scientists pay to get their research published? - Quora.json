            "answer_text": "Publishing has real costs, so someone has to pay... There are two possible parties who will pay - the content producer (i.e. scientist) or the reader. Currently, the most popular business model is to have both parties pay.  There is more about the publishing model here: Why do researchers have to pay to read research papers? Shouldn't papers be free for those who need them? How are publishers able to charge so much? The model where the reader doesn't pay is called Open Access, and is gaining a lot of traction. I think in general people are starting to believe in the idea that reading shouldn't cost money. The cost should be born entirely by the scientist, or perhaps other clever business models (ads, premium services).  I personally think the publishing business model will have to change dramatically in the next 10 years. Likely, neither the scientist nor reader will be paying. Other parties, like scientific equipment manufacturers, recruiting agencies, and scientific corporations will somehow be the primary customers of this wealth of knowledge, and access to scientists.
