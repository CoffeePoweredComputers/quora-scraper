            "answer_text": "Question: - \u201cDoes the sun have a gravitational pull?\u201d The Sun absolutely has a gravitational pull; it is what keeps us (the Earth) in orbit around it, making our seasons, and yearly events. The Sun\u2019s gravity also makes the orbits of the other planets, the \u2018non-planets\u2019 (e.g. Pluto) and the other objects in orbit. Gravity is proportional to mass and the Sun has more mass that all the planets combined. Note that the Sun\u2019s gravity field extends to infinity albeit with reduced effect, so that by the time it gets to the next nearest star, about 4.5 light years distant (also a Sun) the effect is hardly felt.

            "answer_text": "Everything that has mass has a gravitational pull - from a grain of sand to an entire galaxy. The more mass something has - the greater it\u2019s gravitational pull. The sun is about 333,000 times heavier than the Earth - so it\u2019s gravity is MUCH stronger than normal Earth gravity. What prevents us from feeling it is two things: We are a long way away from the sun and gravity gets weaker the further you are away.We are in orbit around the sun - so the centrifugal force of our orbit counteracts the sun\u2019s gravity - and we don\u2019t really feel it.One way we DO feel it is in the tides. Generally, the tides are mostly driven by the moon - but the sun also creates much smaller tides - so when the sun and moon are close together in the sky - or on opposite sides of the Earth - we get higher tides because sun and moon are pulling together.
