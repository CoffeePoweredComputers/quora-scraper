            "answer_text": "Momentum Conservation, We have been reading this word from so much time but still many doubts and misconceptions rise in our mind. Your question now. On an air table when a person pushes the pucks they collide and bounce back. Reason- Because he has applied some force on the puck, which moves forward and wants to move forward but the another puck in the way of the first puck tries to stop the first puck, and is unable to do so as the first cup has some velocity so far and has more momentum. Therefore the second puck moves forward and in turn when it is being moved forward it applies a force on the first cup, which is nothing but the reaction of the force that was applied by the first puck.(3rd Law) Now what happens is that, the whole system's(that table with those two pucks) momentum remains conserved I.e M1V1=M2V2. And if the masses are also same the velocities will also be same. I hope I have helped. ",

            "answer_text": "It's a consequence of Newton's 2nd and 3rd laws. If the collision is elastic, Newton's 3rd law holds, i.e. the sum of the internal forces is zero. In the absence of an external force, [math] \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{before}} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{after}}=0[/math] So, by Newton's 2nd law, [math]\\sum\\dfrac{d\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{before}}}{dt} = \\sum\\dfrac{d\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{after}}}{dt}=0[/math] If we take the integral of the equation above with respect to [math]t[/math] with limits from [math]0[/math] to [math]t'[/math], we end up with [math]\\sum\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{before}}=\\sum\\mathbf{p}_{\\text{after}}[/math] ",
