            "answer_text": "To the best of my knowledge, it has not ended yet. The Flynn Effect is an instability in IQ test scores that is largely hollow with respect to intelligence. It is not something that makes nations, individuals, or age cohorts more intelligent. When tested for g loading, the usual outcome is no loading. To understand how a score increase can be not representative of real intelligence, consider these two cases that are well documented in the scholarly literature: 1 - Increased guessing. This is known as the Brand Effect, after Chris Brand who predicted it decades ago. It was ultimately confirmed when test booklets covering 72 years were uncovered in Estonia. The analysis clearly shows that testees were making more guesses and were guessing more on the most difficult test items (as is logical). These test items also are typically more g loaded, giving the impression that the gains were on g, when they were not. See the related papers by Olev Must and Aasa Must. 2 - The scoring method determines the magnitude of the FE. This has NOTHING to do with intelligence, since the same test booklets are scored twice, once with Classical Test Theory and once with Item Response Theory. The differences are shown in the figure below:  Source: Using Item Response Theory to assess the Flynn Effect in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 79 Children and Young Adults data/ Alexander Beaujean, Steven J. Osterlind/ Intelligence 36 (2008) 455\u2013463. The FE has reversed in several nations, mostly in Western Europe. Initially the reversal was in Scandinavian nations, then spread to others. The instabilities (artifacts) that cause the FE have masked a slow but very long term decline in g (real intelligence). This is primarily being caused by the negative correlation between intelligence and fertility rate. Low IQ people have more children and shorter generational spans than high IQ people. For a detailed description of what is happening to g, I suggest this book:At Our Wits\u2019 End: Why We\u2019re Becoming Less Intelligent and What It Means for the Future, by E. A. Dutton & M. A. Woodley of Menie. Exeter, UK: Imprint Academic. The book was written for the general public and is not technically difficult to understand. ",
