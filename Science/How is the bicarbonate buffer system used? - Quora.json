            "answer_text": "A buffer is a system that is able to resist pH cha he's upon addition of small amounts of acid or base. The system would contain H2CO3 (carbonic acid) and HCO3- (a bicarbonate salt, perhaps NaHCO3 or KHCO3). H2CO3 \u21cc HCO3\u2212 + H+HCO3- + H2O \u21cc H2CO3 + OH-Based on the two equations and according to Le Chatelier\u2019s principle, the system will contain a large reservoir of H2CO3 and HCO3-. Upon addition of small amounts of acid, due to the large reservoir of HCO3-, the reverse reaction in (1) goes to full completion and will remove almost all of the H+ ions added. As such, concentration of H+ will be effectively constant and pH hardly changes. Upon addition of small amounts of base, due to the large reservoir of H2CO3, the reverse reaction in (2) goes to full completion and will remove almost all of the OH- ions added. As such, concentration of OH- will be effectively constant and pH hardly changes. ",
