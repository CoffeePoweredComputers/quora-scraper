            "answer_text": "Survival. And to accomplish survival evolution flows greatly into and toward food. Bears for example are so huge and expend so much energy just being bears that they are constantly eating and foraging just to gather enough fat storage for the next winter. By the time they come full cycle to hibernation season again they usually only have just enough calories stored to make it through the winter... asleep. Imagine if they had to spend all that extra energy fighting off cold, stomping through the snow, and searching for food, with less of that food running around or growing on bushes. With their metabolism they certainly wouldn't make it. Sure some large winter-weathering species have evolved to forage and hunt throughout the cold season (polar bears for example don't fully enter a hibernation state) but they have simply adapted other means of survival, namely a richer diet in fatty seals. Eastern Black Bears however must suffer a 90% diet of plants (not a lot of energy for one so big) and only once per year do some species of bear enjoy the protein and fat rich salmon spawning. Point being that there are innumerable ways that nature has gone about evolving a species for making it through winter months and these are just some of them. Like water in a a rough stone bowl, it flows to fill every available spot. Evolution flows to fill nearly every possible means of exploiting food sources and also food conservation (hibernation). In short the answer to, \"What is the evolutionary purpose of ____\", is always ultimately, \"To survive long enough to reproduce\". ",
