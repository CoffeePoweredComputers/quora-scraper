            "answer_text": "Gold is rare, but easy to find. Unlike other metals like iron it doesn't form many minerals, so in ancient times it was easier to find in its \"native\" or pure form. You might recognize this as gold nuggets like old timey miners found in the gold rushes in the early United States. At the same time, gold is common enough to find pretty regularly.  In American history, there's the black hills gold strike, the California gold strike and the Yukon gold rush I can think of off the top of my head, I'm sure there are others. I can even name places in the ancient world where gold was found the Dolaucothi in Britain. There's the Gold Coast of Africa (modern Ghana). Other scarcer metals like platinum, rubidium or iridium are simply too rare or hard to extract for people to have known about and lusted after for very long. Gold is precious because its rare enough to be rare, but common enough to be well known, and non-reactive enough to be pretty and permanent. Its also really easy to work, because its so soft, but useless for almost anything except ornamentation because...its so soft. Silver is also a pretty common precious metal, but it tarnishes and its more common. As a side note, until the industrial revolution, all metals were uncommon enough to be considered precious. Very few people except for the wealthiest could afford metal weapons and tools. The magic of swords in medieval mythology comes from the scarcity of iron and the skill required to work it. Gold, that holiest of holies, precious of precious was simply the rarest, prettiest metal people were aware of. ",
