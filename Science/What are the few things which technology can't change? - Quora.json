            "answer_text": "1.This song seems to be the antidote to Quora Futurismo. You must remember thisA kiss is just a kiss,a sigh is just a sigh.The fundamental things applyAs time goes by. And when two lovers wooThey still say, \"I love you.\"On that you can relyNo matter what the future bringsAs time goes by. Moonlight and love songsNever out of date.Hearts full of passionJealousy and hate.Woman needs manAnd man must have his mateThat no one can deny. It's still the same old storyA fight for love and gloryA case of do or die.The world will always welcome loversAs time goes by. 2.Sunshine. It makes people happy, it can't be replicated for free, and it makes the world a prettier place. 3.Fresh air. The feeling you get when you walk out of a stuffy environment, and everything feels cleaner and fresher. 4.Technology can't replace the clothes we are wearing, the food we eat, etc. The basic things related to life can't be replaced by technology although they can be modified a bit. For example, most of the clothes we wear are machine made whereas earlier (before technological) development they were hand made. Our feelings can't be replaced by technology. No matter how much advancement happens in technology, our moms will always be worried if we ate properly or not. Technology is just a way of making life more luxurious, it can add many things in our life but can't replace much. And you know\u2026. Some Things Are Just Better in Person.These can only be done in person. You Can\u2019t Fax a HandshakeYou Can\u2019t Pat a Voicemail on the BackYou Can\u2019t Tickle a VoicemailYou Can\u2019t Fax a Pillow FightYou Can\u2019t Slow Dance OnlineYou Can\u2019t Have Coffee With a WebsiteYou Can\u2019t Smell Homemade Bread on Your Pager (It\u2019s extinct\u2026)You Can\u2019t Email a Kiss.No Replacement for Papers.Power of LoveProfessional sportsCreative ArtsHealthcare & Medicine.So at last I would like to say\u2026.. \u201cTechnology already has replaced analog clocks. Honestly, technology can replace anything. Only thing it can't is the human mind and heart..\u201d Thanks for reading\u2026. :) ",
