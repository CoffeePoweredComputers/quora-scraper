            "answer_text": "The methods depend on the types of \u201chardness\u201d present (mostly in terms of the anions) and the reason the \u201chardness\u201d is undesirable. The methods can be broken into 2 strategies. One is to remove the \u201chardness\u201d cations from solution. The other is to dissolve something else in the water to complex the \u201chardness\u201d ions in a way that prevents their undesired reaction in whatever the water\u2019s to be used for. The removal methods can further be broken into 2: formation of an insoluble product, and ion exchange. In ion exchange, the water is put (usually by gravity) thru a column of insoluble material which exchanges some non-\u201dhardness\u201d cation for the cations whose removal is sought. To form an insoluble product, some substance must be dissolved in the water and then undergo salt exchange with \u201chardness\u201d cations, resulting in an insoluble product which is then filtered or allowed to settle out of solution. Certain methods of the insoluble-product-formation type take advantage of an anion that\u2019s already present, accounting for what\u2019s known as \u201ctemporary hard water\u201d: bicarbonate. The bicarbonate must be converted to carbonate, and the resulting calcium and magnesium carbonates precipitated out. Theoretically this conversion may be done by adding any alkali, but is very conveniently done by adding\u2026lime! Lime has 2 equivalents of hydroxide, that can then react with 2 of bicarbonate, the resulting carbonates then reacting with the 1 equivalent of calcium brought in by the lime and then another equivalent that was already present as \u201chardness\u201d. The other sometimes convenient way takes advantage of the process that resulted in water\u2019s being referred to as \u201chard\u201d to begin with, wherein beans cooked in such water came out hard and crusty, because boiling drove off carbon dioxide, turning 2 equivalents of bicarbonate into carbonate. Since many of the reasons water \u201chardness\u201d is undesirable relate to the use of the water in some process wherein heating will cause carbonates to precipitate on the equipment, pre-heating (conveniently, though not necessarily, to the boil) to cause that reaction to take place in advance, and then removing the precipitate, is a useful method. In uses such as laundry where the additional cation and alkalinity won\u2019t interfere, adding a completely different carbonate to the water, usually in the form of washing soda, can also be used to form the insoluble product, which may not even be required to be settled or filtered out before using the water. It turns out that formation of insoluble silicates from the \u201chardness\u201d cations was even more advantageous in laundry. The complexation method was well known when calgon (sodium hexametaphosphate) was widely used in laundry or for preventing boiler scale. The trademark Calgon has since been applied to other water additives for \u201csoftening\u201d by either complexation or precipitation. Other complexation materials now in use are various organic substances or mixtures; one I know of is a mixture of borax and an artificial amino acid, Deselex; polycarbonates are also used. The additive forming the complex should have a high enough affinity for the \u201chardness\u201d ion in question to be able to overcome the undesired attraction that cation has in whatever process the water\u2019s to be used for, because the complex remains in solution. One method that could be considered either ion exchange or precipitation would be adding a zeolite to the water. These are complex salts that were formerly used in ion exchange columns but can also be added in powdered form to the water. The suspension does not dissolve, so you might classify this method with precipitation because the powder remains in the water during use, so this method is satisfactory only when such a suspended cloud would not interfere with the water\u2019s use. Unlike use in a column, the zeolite in this method is discharged with the water and cannot be recharged with sodium or other cation for reuse. ",

            "answer_text": "Soft water (as opposed to softened water) is water with low (or no)   mineral content. There are two ways to reduce/remove minerals from hard water: Filter it with Reverse Osmosis (RO)Distill it. RO will give you 99%+ pure water. Distillation will give you 100% pure water. Either way, the water will have little or no mineral content. Water softeners are different. They use a process called ion-exchange to exchange mineral ions in hard water for sodium or potassium ions. Since softened water still contains minerals, it's not soft water. ",

Water softeners help in removing the minerals that make the water hard. Hard water is bad for your plumbing system and also for your hair. The usage of the water softener will ensure that the household machine life and the lifespan of the pipelines will be boosted for a longer period. Water softeners also ensure that your fabrics are softer and brighter; also, it enables richer lathering of shampoos and soaps. ",
