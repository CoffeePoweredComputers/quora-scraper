            "answer_text": "What is the origin of the concept of wave function in quantum mechanics? Can it have direct physical significance? I will split this to a) QM to physical significance as that is describable; and b) wave to physical - which is not generally agreed. The origin I will not cover. 1 The basic idea of a \u2018wave function\u2019 of the current quantum mechanics models is that electrons have \u2018energy wells\u2019 a) electrostatic proton(+) to electron (-) (opposites attract) attraction toward the nucleus; versus b) e-e electrostatic repulsion from each other (like-kind repel). You add them up and the chosen particle (electron) wants to be somewhere in that \u2018well\u2019.  Particles (electrons) can move around (pendulum style) at various levels (the specifics being generally an unknown position and momentum of Heisenberg). However, the quantum mechanics say \u201cadd up all the time at 1, at +1/2, at +1\u20131/2, etc\u201d (the vertical in the picture above). That gives you an electron distribution (a \u2018cloud\u2019) that is an excellent match to the range of results scientists get as they measure electron position/momentum (by bouncing other electrons off them and measuring the angle to deflection). The measurements vary, but seem to have \u2018centers\u2019 and \u2018densities\u2019 that match these \u2018distributions\u2019 and calculate from e^f wave function using this physical model. Of course, add a few more dimensions, and the process gets very complex. That means - there can be a physical significance to the origin of QM, even though QM works by statistical methods. 2 Yet, the wave function, to me, is not only a) the pendulum of energies up and down within these distributions - that is just one small part. QM has proven the wave function goes to the particle itself. Instead, waves have another feature which is b) an additional nature of the particle that their profile changes energy in a further wave pattern. ",

            "answer_text": "After the Double Slit experiment (with electrons) confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis, particles (and atoms) were starting to look a bit wavy. The Bohr model was adjusted to allow for energy shell waves and, because nobody knew how to handle any bits left over, they stuck with full inter-locking waves - or Standing Waves. When most of the Quantum Facts were known and it was time to make sense of them Heisenberg and Schrodinger took holidays (for different reasons) and both got lucky. In the case of Werner Heisenberg his lists of energy shell interactions 'neatly' led to a Matrix Mechanics solution (although nobody really knows how he got started!). Erwin Schrodinger, on the other hand, took a new lady friend away for a 'diversion' but still found time to ponder the conundrums laid bare by the Quantum Facts. He built upon the Standing Wave ideas and soon devised an equation that described the hydrogen atom as well as previous attempts. The Schrodinger Wave Equation was looking good. In fact it has withstood the test of time and is still being used today. Because the Wave Function (the solution to the Wave Equation) provided multiple alternatives scientists didn't know what to do with them. Eventually the team led by Bohr concluded that these alternatives were not all real outcomes but probabilities (the Copenhagen Interpretation). de Broglie had his own ideas (called the Pilot Wave Interpretation). This accepts that the Wave Equation is real and that the electron somehow surfs the wave until it collapses. The true Quantum Physics Interpretation is still a matter of discussion today. Why not see if you can build your own model? ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of the wave function grew out of the experimental facts that small particles acted like waves and light (which usually acted like a wave) can act like a particle. Thus the wave function was invented to fit the experiment. What's a bit unusual about quantum mechanics is that the probability of something happening depends on the square of the wave function (which is complex.) That's a pretty direct physical significance. When two things are happening, there are two wave functions (like having two particles collide.) The wave functions are additive. The wave function for two particles is the sum of the wave functions for each one. What happens to the two interacting particles depends on the square of the sum of their wave functions; this is not usually the sum of the squares of the wave functions of each particle. In QM, probabilities do not add, wave functions add, then the square of the sum is the probability of something being observed. One can look up (wiki or similar): photoelectric effect, wave function, or quantum probability, for a more complete discussion. ",

            "answer_text": "It probably does have a physical meaning which has been missed when Einstein incorrectly derived that a moving rod contracts in length. He found this result by using the Lorentz transformation to transform the instantaneous coordinates (at a single time t=0) x(1) of the nose of the moving rod and x(2) of the tail of the moving rod into the inertial reference frame within the rod is stationary with length L(0)=x(1)\u2019-x(2)\u2019, and found that x(1)-x(2)=L=L(0)/(gamma): Since (gamma) is Larger than unity he concluded that the length of the rod contracts. But the Lorentz transformation must also transform time, which Einstein conveniently ignored. If Einstein ALSO transformed the time t=0 at x(1) and t=0 at x(1) into the reference frame in which the rod is stationary, he would have found a time t(1)\u2019 at x(1)\u2019 and a different time t(2)\u2019 at x(2)\u2019 even though x(1)\u2019 and x(2)\u2019 are per4manently stationary relative to one an other which DEMANDS that the time at x(1)\u2019 and x(2)\u2019 must be permanently simultaneous, identical times. Obviously Einstein should have chosen t(1)\u2019=t(2)\u2019=0 at x(1)\u2019 and z(2)\u2019 and transformed from the stationary coordinates x(1)\u2019 and x(2)\u2019 to obtain the actual moving coordinates X(1) with its time T(1) and X(2) with its time T(2). He would then have found correctly that L=(gamma)L(0) and that T(1)-T(2)=T=[(gamma)L(0)][v/c^2] In other words there is a time difference T within the moving rod which has a moving length L=(gamma)L(0). this is OPNLY [possible when the entity with length L is a wave with a phase speed of c*=L/T=[(c^2)/v]. This phase speed must be equal to the product of the frequency f of this wave times its wavelength (lambda). Thus c*=(lambda)f=(c^2)/v. When multiplying and dividing with the mass m of the rod one has that (lambda)f=[m(c^2)](mv)=E/p. Now choosing E=hf, one obtains the de Broglie wavelength (lambda)=h/p. Thus the Lorentz transformation of any moving matter-object is the de Broglie wave of this object, even when the object is a \u201cclassical\u201d macro-object! There is NO separate \u201cquantum scale\u201d. ",
