            "answer_text": "Q: Doesn't it impress you that the term \"human fecal dust\" isn't known to scientists and couldn't be found even on the internet? A: No. What impresses me, is the distance to which people will go in seeking something to worry about, all the while ignoring the real threats. No matter what microscopic threat \u201chuman fecal dust\u201d actually poses, past experience in investigating \u2018popular\u2019 health threats assures me that it is extremely likely that that risk is a TINY FRACTION of the risk from smoking,drinking more than 1 drink per day,overeating,failing to exercise, oreating convenience foods.I\u2019m further impressed by how incredibly illiterate even college-educated adults often are, with respect to basic science and statistics, rendering them incapable of making reasonable evaluations of \u2018trending\u2019 reports in the media and in Internet social gossip of various environmental, economic, and health worries.  UPDATE: After the comment, below from the original questioner, I decided to check what might have been published about \u201chuman fecal dust\u201d. I found two interesting points: Searching Google for \u201chuman fecal dust\u201d[1] I discovered that Quora is the #1 source for \u2018information\u2019 on \u201chuman fecal dust\u201d!Searching Google Scholar for \u201chuman fecal dust\u201d[2] , I discovered that the number of scholarly articles on \u201chuman fecal dust\u201d is . . . ZERO! The moment in the drafty church at smokerise Footnotes[1] \"human fecal dust\" - Google Search[2] Google Scholar",

Second, yes, it is found on the internet, and not only on Quora. Read the Popular Science article \u201cYou Cannot Escape Poop Bacteria\". Your entire house, and a good part of the outdoors, have bacteria which are found in feces. Kitchens generally have more even than bathrooms. Your clothes, your books, your walls, are coated in them. If you add in animal fecal bacteria, it's pretty much 100% of surfaces, including under the soil. Nature recycles everything. Fecal matter and dead animals and plants make up what is referred to as \u201corganic matter\" in soil. Soil is almost infertile without it, and cannot hold water properly. The vast majority of fecal bacteria are beneficial. You could not digest your food without them. Ever hear of a \u201cpoop transplant\"? It's where feces from a healthy person are placed inside the intestines of someone who has lost their proper mix of bacteria, and is chronically ill as a result. Approximately 50% of fecal volume is bacteria. That's right. Half of the volume of your poop is bacteria. ",

            "answer_text": ".As many many answerers seem to know what \u201cfecal dust\u201d means, please look at: \u201cFECAL DUST: It comes from fecal residue, left AFTER wiping with t. paper (complete or, worse of course, incomplete) . Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination. That phenomenon is more intense in hospitals, as the patients are usually debilitated, weak, with mobility restriction etc, particularly if there are hemorrhoids or anus hair and are unable to wipe properly. So the flying fecal dust reaches to all ward surfaces, dispersing its pathogenic microbes and so being the cause, among others, of the known HAI. The flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance. It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as now a new microbe source, up to now ignored, is added. Up to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust\u2019s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics \u201c ",

I suspect the term is known to a few scientists, epidemiologists & hygienists perhaps, but why should a low-temperature physicist, or a forensic econometrist, for instance, ever have heard of it?
