            "answer_text": "As stars get fame and fortune they can afford to purchase new homes, and tend to try to get homes where they have visibility and can show of their success. As they get more established they want to have more peace and quiet life, and they move away to more secluded places. Sometime they decide to stop in the business and might move to a semi-permanent residence in areas they enjoy being themselves and/or relax. For stars in the sky the life is different, they don\u2019t really have a choice, and think more about them as dogs on a leach, wherever the nearest neighbors move, the galaxy etc. they have to follow. Stars tend to love physics, so they prefer to stay in orbit around other stars (binary) as well as around the galaxy (they typically belong to). Now there are extreme cases where stars can be thrown out of their galaxy by getting a boost from a black hole, where they start to move away from their birth place, but this is just due to velocity, trajectory and gravity. When it comes to humans you will never see a star move any observable distance as they as so far away, and their speed (even if it\u2019s large) is insignificant in relation to the distance (this mean it would take even the nearest stars 1000 years to move to earth if they were on a straight trajectory. So in a life time they might move much less than a fraction of the size of the moon (if you were to observe them every year). Our nearest star (other than Sol (our sun)), is about 40,000,000,000,000 km away. Using our sun as a \u2018typical\u2019 speed 72,000 km/h, we get that it would take about 64,000 years. To have the MOST apparent motion a star would have to move sideways (not towards or away) from your point of observation. Say you observe the star for 60 years it would have moved 60 x 365 x 72,000km, giving us a triangle with sides of 1.5B km (side ways movement) and distance of 40,000, which mean the angle moved is 0.002 degrees or about 1/75,000 of your visual angle. So way more than 1 pixel on a picture would represent (and hence you not able to tell if it moved or not). So stars are not moving at all in your lifetime, however the earth is, and through it\u2019s orbit around the sun, and rotation around it\u2019s axis, stars looks to be moving all the time, just as a room look to be moving if you spin around in circles. And finally stars (small objects that can be a toy for a kid that\u2019s too big to lodge it in it\u2019s throat) would move due to the child is playing with it. I bet there are other definition of stars, but these are the ones I think about that might answer your question. ",
