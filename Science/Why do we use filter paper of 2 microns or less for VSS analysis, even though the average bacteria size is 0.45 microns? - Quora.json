            "answer_text": "I am no micro-biologist or anything of that sort. But, it is a general rule of thumb in scientific investigations to use 2 & 10 as factors of safety or approximation as default values unless a more precise value is warranted specifically for the problem on hand. Say I am designing a column or a beam and your computation call for 2.87\u2033 post it is normal to go for a 6X6 post as it is nearest standard post available which about 5.74\u2033. Or for that matter if it calls for 3.05\u2033, even though it is slightly less than 3.1. Like wise when you are designing any electrical gizmos especially concerning current and voltage any variance of 10% is ignored as the error in power or energy computation will be just 1% off. At this point I reread teh question and it said bacteria are 0.45 microns in size and I went ooops, I going to look stupid and am fucked up. So went my friend Mr. Google and he said you are off by a factor o 10X. They are actually 5.0 microns. Sorry, I am throwing my lot with Mr. Google. Extending that rule of thumb if the bacterial are 5 micron then we can pretty much filter out most of the bacteria with a 2 micron filter. Even if some of the bacteria are less than 2 micron after initial passage most of those will also be blocked by the left behind larger bacteria effectively reduce the size of the filter for later bacterial. Of course in your specific situation the population of bacteria in your study are less than 2 microns, then you will have to use more finer filter. So if your bacteria are indeed 0.45 microns, you need to look for 0.2 micron filters. ",
