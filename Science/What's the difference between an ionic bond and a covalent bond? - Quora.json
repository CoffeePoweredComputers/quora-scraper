            "answer_text": "The physical world tends to be into stablest energy level for which it undergoes various changes both at physical and chemical system. The same happens with atoms , the atom combine with one another and form bond which decreases the potential energy of the reacting system. As per the conditions of electron density the bond us of two types ionic and covalent. The atom can form bond by transfer or sharing of electron to attain the noble gas configuration as it is the stablest energy level. This led to the idea of octet rule. So when a bond is formed by transfer of electron completely from the one atom to other the bond formed is ionic. For example if sodium and chlorine are reacted they form an ionic compound NaCl. As sodium as 1 valence electron it will tend to donate rather than accept 7 electron to form an octet and chlorini has 7 valence electron so it needs one electron to complete its octet. So one valence electron of sodium is accepted by chlorine and they both combine to form a stable molecule which is has less potential energy than the elements in the molecule. The bond which is formed due to mutual sharing of electron is called covalent. The best example is water molecule. As oxygen has 6 valence electron it is in need of two more for complete octet. Hydrogen has 1 electron overall and needs 1 more for a duplet. So oxygen shares the electron with two hydrogen atoms to form a covalent compound.  So ionic and covalent differ in the way of bond formation. Ionic compound have high melting and boiling point that covalent compound as it involves complete transfer of electron because of which there is strong electrostatic force of attraction between the molecules. I hope it was helpful as per your needs. This explanation is still incomplete there is much more to know about the ionic and covalent bonding like orbital overlapping,partial covalent character in ionic bond and partial ionic character in covalent bond due to distortion of electron cloud density and many more aspects like this. But this much of knowledge will meet the basic requirements. ",

            "answer_text": "This happens to be an excellent question, and I am not sure this answer is adequate. At the extremes, it is simple. The covalent bond forms by two electrons occupying a common wave function that is bound by two atoms. Contrary to what many will say, the electrons do not have to come from different atoms. Thus the compound formed with the structure BH3NH3 has all the physical properties of a covalent bond, but the lone pair of ammonia provides both electrons. One of the key properties is the structure is fixed and usually has a fixed structure that is maintained at all times, other than the breaking of the compound. An ionic compound is one where the two electrons reside on one atom, one of which has been transferred to make the pair on the anion that, apart from net charge, behaves like a lone pair. Typically, they have no structure other than the packing of opposite charges which is defined by the ions size. Ionic compounds dissolve in solvents that can provide polarization stabilization. The problem arises with certain compounds described as having ionic nature. These have structure but large dipoles in their bonds and can dissociate at est partially in solution. These tend to involve metals with large valence. The question is, what is the difference between the pure ionic bond, and an ionic bond where a pair of electrons is strongly associated with the so-called \u201ccation\u201d so it forms a structure? Is AlCl3 ionic? You decide. ",

            "answer_text": "Ionic and covalent bonds are a man-made classifications to make understanding how atoms interact more easily. At this point in education, they have become scripture and often prevent understanding instead of helping it. When two atoms are close to each other, they have a go at each other\u2019s electrons. What happens depends on how strong the nucleus of each atom pulls on the other\u2019s electrons. That, in turn depends on other things. There is a measure of how strong an atom pulls electrons - it\u2019s called electronegativity.  If both atoms pull with about equal strength, then they are at an impasse. They may end up sharing electrons. They form a molecule. This is called covalent bonding by almost everyone.  If one atom pulls much strongly than the other, then it may strip off an electron completely. If this happens, you end up with two ions - the atom with the extra electron is a negative ion, and the atom which has lost the electron is a positive ion. What happens next depends on where your ions are. If they are in water, then water molecules surround the ions. They become part of water mesh. If they are not in water, then the ions tend to arrange themselves in a more or less organized structure. Think of how metal flakes arrange themselves in a magnetic field. This is similar to that. Because of the electromagnetic forces of the ions, the ions arrange themselves in orderly ways. The end result is a crystal solid. People generally point a finger at this process and call it ionic bonding. Some call the bonds between ions in the crystal ionic bonds. There are no such bonds in water, however. Some skip on the definition and waterwash by explaining properties of ionic compounds. So there is no single good definition of an ionic bond.  Random stupid stuff people say about bonds:\u201cSome atoms want to lose electrons\u201d - No atom wants to lose an electron. Some pull on electrons less strongly. \u201cAtoms become more stable by losing/gaining electrons\u201d - Atoms become less stable by losing/gaining electrons: A lone ion is more unstable than a lone atom. An ion in a crystal is however, is more stable than the comparable atom. The process of becoming a crystal increases stability. This is why ionic bonds and ionic compounds cannot really be studied separately - the stability increase due to crystal formation drives the entire thing forward. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two types of atomic bonds - ionic bonds and covalent bonds. They differ in their structure and properties. Covalent bonds consist of pairs of electrons shared by two atoms, and bind the atoms in a fixed orientation. Relatively high energies are required to break them (50\u2005-\u2005200 kcal/mol). Whether two atoms can form a covalent bond depends upon their electronegativity i.e. the power of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself. If two atoms differ considerably in their electronegativity\u2005-\u2005as sodium and chloride do - then one of the atoms will lose its electron to the other atom. This results in a positively charged ion (cation) and negatively charged ion (anion). The bond between these two ions is called an ionic bond. For more information please watch the below video :  ",

            "answer_text": "The difference between ionic and covalent bonding is how the electrons are distributed and shared between the atoms. In ionic bonding a cation and an anion meet and the cation transfers its lost electron to the anion which, in turn, gains an electron. However, in covalent bonding the electrons are shared between the overlap region of the two or more orbitals of the atoms. Ionic bonding usually results in stronger bonds than covalent bonds because of Coulomb's Law. This can be explained by comparing the boiling points of covalent compounds with that of ionic compounds. It is pretty obvious that if ionic bonds have stronger bonds than covalent bonds then they should have a higher boiling point because it would take more energy to break the bonds between them. ",

An ionic bond is the electrostatic attraction betweens ions of opposite charges. Where the ions came from is irrelevant.  The sea is 'full' of sodium ions, and 99.99973% have never ever been sodium atoms. They started off as sodium nuclei (Na11+) in stars and over time have picked electrons until they pick up 10 of them thus becoming Na1+ ions. These are quite happy and live their lives as Na1+ ions unless something very drastic happens.   Because 'Na' is found in the Periodic Table, you cannot assume that Na atoms are the stable form of sodium. They are  not.  Na1+ ions are.  A purely ionic bond involeve zero overlap of orbitals of the postive and negative ions.  Does that ever happen? No, all bonds show some covalent character. ",

Because of being charged now,they feel an attractive force due to other one and hence there's formation of an electrostatic bonding usually known as ionic bonding. On the other hand,in covalent bonding,like in carbon,neither it can donate its electrons nor can take(reason? I think you know! And if you don't then you can ask about that in comment section).

And electrostatic attraction between the positive and negative ions results in a strong, non-molecular bond. And this is what we mean in elementary chemistry when we describe ionic bonding as the result of the transfer of electrons to form discrete ions, and covalent bonding results from the SHARING of electrons. Ionic bonding typically results in non-molecular materials, whereas covalent bonding can result in both non-molecular materials, AND discrete MOLECULES. ",

Ionic is different. It happens when an atom like sodium gives its only one electron well past its midpoint from its outer shell to another atom : chlorine. Chlorine already has its own 7 electrons in neutral state. So remember the Octet rule: 8. When it happens, the sodium electron goes into chlorine\u2019 vincinity. Sodium becomes positive ion. Chlorine now becomes negative chloride ion. You can say that the electron moves to a new location now so close to chlorine nucleus lots closer than convalent bond. Ionic bonding is basically stronger than convalent compounds. The electron from an atom is now in another atom\u2019s shell thats lots closer to nucleus make it harder to break up. If we clip the ionic compounds with pair of scissors in air, it takes more energy to break it open than convalent bond. Since they are not in air, they are in water. The polarity of water molecules has effects on ionic compounds that may weaken them due to environmental factors. If they are in different nonpolar organic solvents, the ionic compounds should be more stable. ",

They occur when there is little to no difference in electronegativity between the atoms in the bond. Ionic bonds are bonds formed between two ions with opposite charges. Ionic bonds form when one atom gives up one or more electrons to another atom. The two ions are then held together by electrostatic charge. ",
