            "answer_text": "Of course they can. Take, for example, balsa wood at 270 kg/cubic meter, and glass at 2700 kg/cubic meter. These have different densities, but a 1m x 1m x 1m cube of glass will have the same mass as a 1m x 1m x 10m block of balsa wood. Now if your question is whether two objects of the same size and the same mass can have different densities, the answer (assuming the objects to be solid throughout) is no. ",
