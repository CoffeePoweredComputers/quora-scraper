            "answer_text": "Yes, all quantum particles with mass must travel through time, just like we do. When I sit on my couch, I am going through space at 0 mph, but I am going through time at the rate of 1 year per year. If I was going through space at the rate of .8 c (80% of the speed of light), then you would see me go through time at the rate of .6 years per year. The faster I go through space, the slower I go through time. Since I have a rest mass, I will never be able to go the speed of light. But the faster I go through space, the slower I will go through time. Because a particle with mass can never go the speed of light, it will always go through time at some rate. A particle going through space at .99 c will go through time at .141 years per year. The only particles that don\u2019t travel through time are particles that have no rest mass, and therefore they are required to go the speed of light. These massless particles include photons, gravitons and gluons. Because they have no rest mass, they must travel through space at the speed of light, and they don\u2019t travel through time at all. From a photon\u2019s perspective, it is everywhere along its trajectory at the same time. ",
