            "answer_text": "Locally? Dark matter doesn't really \"clump\", it's just wafting around the place. As for local effects you got to remember that gravity is a very weak force. Very difficult to measure in great detail except at cosmic scales. Think about it. If a 500 tonne train drives by do you feel it's gravity? Nope. In fact you'd need a pretty damn sensitive instrument to pick it up at all. I'm not sure even a laser inferometer is up to the task. So detecting a bit of dark matter in your area would be very difficult. ",
