            "answer_text": "Oh it's an interesting story. TL;DR:  Figure out the missing parts!  Let's start with a the ancient greeks. There were two theories. One said, that matter is created by the four elements Water, Fire, Wind and Earth. A second theory postulated, that everything is made up from small building blocks (they didn't define a specific shape) which are indestructible, called atom. Atom comes from \u00e1tomos, which means impartible. Somehow, this theory stayed. (But the elements were not forgotten, either) A few centuries after those theories, was the model of Dalton. John Dalton (* 6. September 1766 and \u2020 27. July 1844) published 1808 a book called A new System of Chemical Philosophy in which he wrote his atom hypothesis down. It consists out of four main points: Every substance is made out of the smallest possible and indestructible spherical unit, called Atom. (just like the greeks...)Every atom of a certain element has the same properties, such as volume and mass. But the atoms from different elements are different in mass and volume.Atoms can't be destroyed, nor created.Chemical reactions only bind several atoms together, or destroy those bindings in specific proportions. His theory is derived from Antoine Lavoisier's (* 26. August 1743 \u2020 8 May 1794) work. He said the famous sentence:  Rien ne se cr\u00e9e, rien ne se perd, tout se transforme.(nothing creates itself, nothing is lost, everything transforms itself) Well, stupid history. A bunch of names, a few citations but nothing to do with chemistry. So your question is how did they know that? The law of conservation of mass from Lavoisier seems logical, but isn't that easy. If you burn steel wool on a balance, you can see that it gains weight. On the other hand, if you add Zinc (Zn) to Hydrochloric acid (HCl) it loses weight. Lavoisier was one of the first chemists, who used balances in his lab. (as a side-note, the first spring scales date back to 1770. Guess when Lavoisier discovered the law...) The answer is in the book from Dalton. Those weird behaviours are reactions, where either atoms bind itself (in the case of steel wool) or evaporates as gas. Lavoisier therefore measured many reactions, and isolated them (such as an added container to measure gas) and found out, that if you add the gas coming out from a reaction, the mass stays the same. The most important part of Daltons discoveries are the proportions. He used scales as well, and created many reactions. He varied the amount of substances and mixed them together, and found out that they always bind themselves in certain proportions. Such 1:2 (H2O or SiO2) or 1:4 (SO4 or NH4). Based on this behaviour, he concluded, that each element behaves in the same manner and has the same properties. But the world of simple chemistry was doomed to be destroyed... Sir Joseph John Thomson (* 18. December 1859 \u2020 30. August 1940) destroyed the idea of indestructible (ha! pun not intended...) particles. Several scientists before Thomson suggested, that atoms were built up from fundamental units in the size of atoms, but Thomson was the first one to suggest a unit 1'000 smaller than the atom. And in fact, this unit is our now well-known (but not so well-understood...) electron.  And again, how did he do that?   Thomson experimented with cathode rays. In easy words, if you fill a tube with gas and add different charges on each end, you can observe a glow. Until that point, now one knew how electric currents worked. In 1897, Thomson measured the mass (I don't know how, maybe a smarter Quoran can help me out!) of the cathode rays and showed that they were around 1800 times lighter than hydrogen, the lightest atom. Therefore, they can not be atoms, but a new particle. A smaller one, or subatomic particle. He called them corpuscule and they were later on named electron.  Thomson thought that those particles came from the gas inside the tube. But since atoms are neutral, and don't provoke the same effects as this new particle, he thought of an other opposite part, which is positive. The idea of the new atom is that the electron is distributed equally in a sort of shell, which is charged positively. This model is also called the plum pudding model...    But we know, that atoms are different. So what's missing? Right, Rutherford's model is missing! Ernest Rutherford (* 30. August 1871 \u2020 19. October 1937) crushed the expectations of the easy model, again. He said, that the atom is made out of a big center, which is positive and smaller, negative particles flying around this core.   Puh! That's a strange image. The idea is that the source is a radioactive source, that creates positive, alpha rays (Helium nucleus). This particles are shoot on a thing gold foil. Around the foil is a detector, which marks the impact of the radioactive particles.  Let's assume that Thomson's model is correct. There are two outcomes. Either all the particles are reflected, because the whole sphere containing the electrons is positive, and there are no impacts behind the gold foil, or all the particles pass the gold foil, because the sphere is somewhat positive, but can't deflect the positively alpha particles. (Note that they understood the electron a bit, not the positive charged subunit). But, as always, a mix of both expectations came out. Nearly all the rays passed, but a few of them were heavily derived. The following image explains it pretty well.   The conclusion is, that an atom has a positive core, which is bug enough to derive alpha particles. Around this core is a lot of space filled with electrons, which don't influence the outcome of the alpha particles. The Rutherford model was born. We now have a big atom, with a core and a lot of space filled with a few electrons. Until now, those electrons don't have a specific place, they just fly around in this empty space. Why empty space? Because if the atoms wouldn't have such a big empty space, and the cores would nearly touch each other, no alpha particle could pass. In fact, only a few particles were derived, which suggests of a big empty area around the core. As always, there was someone who just couldn't let the world the way it was. Niels Bohr (* 7. October 1885 \u2020 18. November 1962) saw that different alkali metals in a flame produced different colours, even though the metal itself stayed and didn't evaporate or disappeared. The same outcome can be observed in a tube filled with gaz and attached to an electrical source.   From this observation (and a formula, which has been proven theoretically but no impact in the practical outcome..) he concluded that the space around the nucleus is subdivided in different orbits on which an electron can be. Each orbit has it's own energy level. An electron on a stable energy level doesn't emit any photons. The electron emits energy only when it changes the orbit. But where does the energy come from? Remember, we put the metal in a flame...   A bit more details. Based on the classical physique, the electron should emit energy, end at a certain point crush on the nucleus. The idea is to create a system like the planetary system, with a center and the planets (or the electrons) floating around. To be stable, the electron doesn't emit energy when it's on an orbit. It only absorbs or emits energy, when it changes an orbit. When the electron jumps from an unstable orbit to a stable one, it releases energy in the form of a photon. Depending on the orbit, the electron has more or less energy and is therefore seen as a different color. But wait! It wouldn't be chemistry, if we wouldn't have another model, as well!  Classical Physics seemed to be finished and full discovered in the 19th century, except for a few small problems. Those few problems led to Quantum Physics, and a new model of the atom. As we said, we added an exception to our classical physique by saying that the electron somehow doesn't lose energy. And exceptions don't work quite well, if we want to have reliable theories, or even laws. The double slit experiment started to raise doubts about the true nature of photons. And there have been a bunch of problems, that just couldn't really fit.  So after a many equations, and theories and things nobody understands is the new, quantum model.  What does it say? Well it's all based on the electrons weird nature. Every electron from an atom has several properties: A principal quantum number n. This describes the distance from an orbital to the center.An Angular momentum quantum number l. This describes the shape of the orbital. (A sphere, a barbell, etc.)A magnetic quantum number m_l. This describes the orientation in space. You can have the same orbital, but one for every axis. (X,Y,Z)And a spin m_s. This describes a property of the electron itself. It can only be +1/2 or -1/2. (the electron only)They all can be calculated and have different possible values for every atom. The most important thing to remember is, that every electron needs to distinguish itself by at least one of the four quantum number from every other one in an atom. This leads to complex structures (as seen in the image above. And below...) how the atoms are build. The chemical bounds and reactions can be explained by this model as well. There are methods to combine orbitals (linear combination of atomic orbitals) and to explain several bonds.   I'll open a small bracket here. It's called quantum, because the units and matter are quantifiable. (Heuh heuh you funny, you) That means that there is a smallest part of everything. A smallest size, a smallest charge, a smallest ... And everything else is a multiple of this. The spin is such an example. It can only be +1/2 or -1/2. (the electron) NEVER in between. If you measure it, and make experiments with it, you only get one of those two results, never another one. So the initial idea of \u00e1tomos isn't that wrong. It simply wasn't small enough. Bracket closed... And since there is a lot, a LOT , A LOT more math than I even know exists behind all those models (more the last ones) exist even more fundamental particles with different properties and behaviours. The coolest part is that there are predicted particles, which are later on found in particle accelerators, such as in C.E.R.N. There are the elementary particles. They are grouped into fermions (makes up matter) and bosons (the particles that do the interactions between the other ones; the force) . As you can see are the spins from the bosons all 1 (except for that golden grail; the higgs boson). And they come from another equation than the fermions. An interesting property is  that they can align their spin (they are symmetric) and therefore things like lasers are possible whereas fermions can't align (they are asymmetric) and need to differentiate themselves by at least one of the quantum number. Because of this characteristic, the fermions create things like atoms, because they can't align themselves and need to built up in space whereas bosons can be delocalised and behave different.    Disclaimer: I haven't even finished high school, and you should not trust me.  I have no idea what I'm talking about. So if you disagree with my professional opinion, just let me know and I'll fix that. I hope I haven't messed up too much. Please also note, I have absolutely no idea (one again) and all those things are based on years and years of research and studying, and have solid math backgrounds. I tried to simplify it to a point where many statements are not true, but to give you an overview of our weird world.  But as you can read in my sources, you can't trust the chemists either, because they just contradict themselves every few decades. So I hope you enjoyed reading...

            "answer_text": "I see several of the answers so far have focused on the discovery/inference of the existence of the atom, not on the structure. So I will focus on the structure, providing a quick and somewhat simplified history of its discovery. The first experiment to really delve into the structure was Thompon's experimental proof that \"cathode rays\" were rays of electrons, which in turn had to be constituents of the atom (J. J. Thomson). Next was Millikan's \"Oil Drop Experiment\", which established the mass/charge ratio of the electron. Between the two of them, this allowed the formation of the \"Thomson model\" for the atom, where the electrons balanced the charge of the protons, but were embedded in the atoms like raisins in a pudding. But this model had problems: we already knew, for example, that the electromagnetic force -- according to classical physics -- could not bind them together in a stable aggregate. Yet we knew atoms were very stable. Also, as we learned about spin and the Uncertainty Principle, it became clear that electrons cannot stay in the nucleus. This difficulty (and others) was resolved by Rutherford's scattering experiments, where he showed that the atom was mostly empty space, with a very concentrated mass at the center providing the center of scattering. But this introduced a new problem: what could be holding together all that positively charged matter? Shouldn't the electric force drive it apart into elementary particle, i.e. protons? That is why the scattering experiments were key experiments on the way to not only discovering protons and neutrons, but the nuclear force between them,  a force much stronger than the electromagnetic force at short range. Because of the spin and uncertainty problems mentioned above, physicists were starting to guess the existence of the neutron (Rutherford was already using the term in 1920 -- 10 years before Chadwick confirmed their existence: see Neutron), but experimental evidence was hard to come by, since they don't interact easily. They are, after all, neutral, so unless you get a direct hit of neutron and nucleus, they flit right past. And both are very small, so those direct hits are rare (exceptions do exist, but they are due to weird quantum mechanical effects well outside the scope of this article). This was a landmark achievement, but there were still a lot of mysteries about the nuclear force. To probe those mysteries, physicists continued to use scattering experiments of various kinds: elastic scattering, inelastic scattering, deep inelastic scattering... Key to making deductions out of all these experiments were not only the basic ideas of the scientific method (hypothesis->experiment->theory etc.) but also application of 1) conservation of energy, 2) conservation of momentum and 3) quantum mechanics. These three were even more important than Newton's Laws and Maxwell's Equations to nuclear physics. They were vital for both designing useful experiments and interpreting the results to form coherent theories. Unfortunately, at least in the short run, ramping up the energy of these scattering/collision experiments started producing more and more unexpected particles: kaons, muons, pions... it became such a bewildering mess, Pauli is said to have joked when asked about some elementary particle, \"I am a physicist, not a zoologist\". But then physicists realized that certain of the quantum mechanical operators for particles (e.g. annihilation/creation operators), transform like Lie groups. But since the representation theory of Lie groups and their corresponding Lie algebras was already well known, this enabled them to make some sense out of what otherwise looked like pure chaos, leading to \"the eightfold way\", which in turn led to the Standard Model, including the modern model for the nucleus in which each of neutron and proton consist of three quarks (down-down-up and up-up-down respectively). There you have it: a nutshell version of the history of physicists figuring out atomic structure. I have left a lot out, but I hope this is enough to give you a pretty good idea of what it was like and whet your appetite for more investigation. ",
