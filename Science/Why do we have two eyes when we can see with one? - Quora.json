            "answer_text": "Having two eyes gives humans depth perception and a larger visual field. This enables one to see farther into the peripheral (side) vision, and it also allows one to see in three dimensions to judge how close or far away objects in the line of sight are. Individuals who are blind in one eye or who lose vision in one eye lack decent depth perception, or stereoscopic vision. These individuals are only able to see in one or two dimensions and often use spatial cues to judge how near or far objects are located in relation to them. For example, a larger object will he perceived as closer. Furthermore, the individual is forced to physically turn his/her head to view objects in the peripheral vision on their \u201cblind\u201d side of his/her visual field. ",

Or, unlike some other creatures as they are both pointing forward, it\u2019s a handy survival adaptation because, with a nose in the way, your peripheral vision would be limited to one side or the other and your ability to judge distance and speed of an approaching threat or to work out whether you could catch \u2018it\u2019 and eat it would be seriously affected. Unfortunately, to many of us are exhibiting signs or symptoms of becoming \u201cmonocular\u201d in childhood and in education, let alone the workplace as, display screen equipment exacerbates the degree of visual stress or eye-strain due to over-exposure to poorly or, not at all, well adapted or customised screens. Too many DSE operators in the workplace are looking forward to a dystopian future of becoming Dalek\u2019s, one-eyed and legless, as a, sort of, evolutionary adaptation, through prolonged hours on-screen and seated immobility. Anyway, perhaps with greater focus on \u201cproductivity\u201d and, maybe Wellbeing and Health of employees at the beginning of the 21st Century, employers will finally be nudged or encouraged to recover their significant losses due to eye-strain, Computer Vision Syndrome, Screen Fatigue and presenteeism by addressing these occupational risks prior to the employee developing even more debilitating work related repetitive stress injuries like upper limb and other muscular skeletal disorders requiring rehabilitation and some long time off-work ?
