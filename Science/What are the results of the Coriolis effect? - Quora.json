            "answer_text": "The Coriolis force is a fictitious force that creates a sideways acceleration on objects moving in rotating frames of reference. When I say it is a \"fictitious force\", I mean first that it does not exist when the motion is observed relative to an inertial frame of reference (e.g. with respect to the fixed stars). A fictitious force appears to act on objects with no physical cause (e.g. gravity, magnetism) to an observer in a non-inertial frame (e.g. the rotating Earth). The particulars of the Coriolis are that it appears to push a flow to the right in the Northern hemisphere and to the left in the Southern hemisphere. If something is not moving relative to the Earth there is no Coriolis force and Coriolis force is normally only significant for flows on very large distance scales (Gulf of Mexico, yes - your bathtub, no). The flow of air in a hurricane can be understood as a balance of a pressure difference (a real, physical force) and the Coriolis force. If a low pressure area develops, air starts to flow into it. As it flows into it, it is diverted to the right (Northern hemisphere), which prevents it from quickly filling in the low pressure. What develops is air moving in a circle with the pressure difference trying to move it to the left and the Coriolis balancing it by trying to move it to the right. ",

            "answer_text": "Coriolis effect cannot be described without studding of the Dynamics of the Vacuum plasma upon the surface of Earth. The Vacuum plasma is not moving but due to spinning speed of Earth, it has a motion in the opposite direction(East to West) relative to the Earth\u2019s rotation. Vacuum plasma applies a Resistance against moving masses and it is bigger on denser materials.  ",

            "answer_text": "When an area of lower atmospheric pressure develops, air flows towards the centre of the low pressure system, but the air is deflected from the radial direction by the rotation of the earth which has lower velocity nearer the poles. This causes the formation of cyclones (also called hurricanes or typhoons). Cyclones rotate anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. This does not apply to the draining of a basin because the coriolis effect is negligible at small scales. ",

            "answer_text": "The Coriolis\u2019 force is defined by the cross product of two vectors, that is, \u03a9 the rotation vector and v the velocity vector F = -2m\u03a9 x v. As viewed from the north pole, Earth turns counterclockwise, so westerly winds are going in the same direction of the rotation of Earth, thus the force is outward from the rotation axis. Use the three fingers vector product rule. ",
