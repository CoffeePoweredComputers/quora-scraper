            "answer_text": "An element with 6 protons and 6 neutrons is for sure carbon. But when 5 electrons come into picture, that becomes dingy. The number of protons stated as six means that we are definitely talking about carbon as their is no other element to have the same atomic number, a property unique to every element. Five electrons indicates one less electron than should have been in a neutral atom so you'll now have a positively charged cation-C+. P. S. C+ does not much of exist. ",
