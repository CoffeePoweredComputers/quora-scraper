            "answer_text": "In the electron orbits. Simply understood, Normal everyday matter is made up of atoms. lots and lots of atoms. On the order of tens to the power twenty three around. These atoms can be called, if you look from far away, neutral. But we know that they are made of protons and electrons and many other things. The electrons in themselves are just tiny particles, but they kind of orbit around proton, not gravitationally but electrically. A tiny tiny current. Note we are using an analogy as a model which is un mathematical. When these electrons fall closer to their nucleus proton, as in fall closer, they release light. Conversely, to get the electron orbit farther from the nucleus you must pump in light. Light as in EM wave. All the potential energy is in such orbital dances in the atom, falling closer and giving off energy or requiring energy to orbit farther. For ex: Consider a piece of wood or a barrel of oil, the atoms in there are all fine and stable with respect to the surrounding environment, the electrons of those wood or oil all orbiting, but at a higher level. Think of yourself as an electron who is not at the ground or first floor of a building, say Burj Khalifa, but at the 100th floor. All fine and stable. If I using another electron hit the wood electron or oil electron at a high speed/energy, the electron, or you will start falling. As you fall from the 100th floor to the ground floor, or the electron, it gives off EM waves in doing so which is what you need. ",
