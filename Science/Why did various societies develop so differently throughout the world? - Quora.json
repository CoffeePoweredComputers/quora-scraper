            "answer_text": "Religions started by individuals who\u2019s ability to make up and tell ridiculous stories about \u201cgods\u201d who told them what to do have been responsible for more diversification (and deaths) than any other factor. This was particularly prevalent in prehistoric and medieval times when the masses were largely uneducated. For example, the late Stan Lee created many such characters in the 20th century and no one believed that they were true. They were simply seen as entertainment. But if he had lived a thousand years ago, there would have been hundreds of people who implicitly believed everything he wrote and there would probably have been religions centred around Spider-Man, the Hulk, Doctor Strange, the Fantastic Four, and Iron Man to name but a few! What is, perhaps, amazing is that several ancient doctrines are STILL believed by comparatively educated people in the enlightened twenty-first century where there are millions of people in different parts of the world who are dedicated followers of long-dead charlatans who, in their personal lust for power, originally started their myths and folk stories. Those stories, of course, included wonderful rewards for the faithful (like nirvana, life after death, happy hunting grounds, twenty-seven virgins etc.) but, unfortunately, NO guarantees that can ever be claimed. For example, the Christian promise of life-after-death will never be challenged because all those people who were expecting it won\u2019t be able to complain when they don\u2019t get it because THEY\u2019LL BE DEAD and, according to the very same book that they use as their handbook, know nothing; they have no further reward, and even their name is forgotten. Their love, their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun. (Ecclesiastes 9:5,6) And that was written by the man that the Bible claims was the wisest man who ever lived! Christianity has become prevalent in Europe because the Roman Emperor, who was all-powerful throughout Europe, Constantine the Great decreed it because it suited his financially-strapped empire following a number of expensive wars to have a single god that the plethora of Roman gods of their hitherto pagan religio. You have already gone some way to answering your own question Aisyah where you have mentioned a number of other factors resulting in the diversity of modern civilisations and so I won\u2019t repeat them all here but have just added what I believe to have been a MAJOR aspect to your question.

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a tendency for people to think oh, Europeans had this or that, but remember that all these things were invented only once or twice and then they spread. Europeans had writing, for example, but they didn\u2019t invent writing - they learned it from people in the Middle East, along with agriculture. Europeans had science because they had mathematics, but they got mathematics from the Arab world, and from Ancient Greece. From South America up to around California the Native Americans had great cities the equal of anything in Europe. Some of the societies in South America had their own writing, which was rather cumbersome but which - unlike Europeans - they had invented for themselves. They had superb stone-masonry techniques, and better astronomical knowledge than the Europeans had. The settled agricultural tribes were superb horticulturalists, and were the first people to cultivate many of our modern crops. But they were largely cut off from the old world, so they didn\u2019t have access to the shared pool of old world inventions. They couldn\u2019t get silk and gunpowder from China or zero from the Arabs or chess from India. They had no horses or oxen (bison don\u2019t domesticate well), only dogs and llamas and alpacas, The most technically advanced groups, in South America, often lived in areas where the roads were narrow mountain tracks, so there was no incentive to develop wheeled vehicles which would have been of use only inside their towns. And they didn\u2019t have access to iron or the means to make bronze, nor to the metalworking techniques which the rest of us learned from China and Africa. Having to use tools made of stone and bone and gold would cramp anybody\u2019s style. ",
