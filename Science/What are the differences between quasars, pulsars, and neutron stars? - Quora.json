            "answer_text": "I am not going to get in great scientific details about all of them but just as the question sounds as you just need a beginner guide. So let\u2019s do it. Quasars:- Quasars are the brightest known things in the universe, When seen through a telescope (Powerful Enough) they seem like a star but at an incredibly far-far away distance almost at the edge of observable universe. Now knowing that they are such far away but still they appear as bright as stars, they must be very luminous. As you may know nearly every galaxy has a super-massive black hole at the center and it has an accretion disk (which is basically formed by diffused material in orbital motion around a massive central body in this case a black hole) when the gases fall in a high speed into the black hole they release energy in form of Electromagnetic Radiation (Light), So by this analogy Quasars are Quasars are extremely distant objects in our known universe. They are the furthest objects away from our galaxy that can be seen. Quasars are extremely distant objects in our known universe. They are the furthest objects away from our galaxy that can be seen. Quasars are extremely bright masses of energy and light. quasar is believed to be a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion disk. An accretion disk is a flat, disk-like structure of gas that rapidly spirals around a larger object, like a black hole, a new star, a white dwarf, etc.  image source: wiKipedia (quasars: the brightest object in the universe) Neutron Stars:- I will go for neutron star first because the pulsar is inter-dependent on your understanding of neutron stars. Before that let is have a brief about Life Stages of a star, observe the image below:-  Image Source:- www.telescope.org As you can see an average sized star (Example: our own sun) can never under go supernova(it is an astronomical event which happens during last stage of a massive star, marked with a bright, destructive explosion that is such bright thag it can outshine an entire galaxy) thus, no chance of becoming neither a black hole nor a neutron star. but when a massive star under goes supernova at the last stage of it\u2019s stellar-evolution it can either become a black hole or a neutron star, it depands upon mass of star. so finally, A neutron star is formed during a supernova, an explosion of a star that is at least 8 solar masses(8 times that of sun). The maximum mass of a neutron star is 3 solar masses. If it gets more massive than that, then it will collapse into a quark star, and then into a black hole. So neutron stars are formed when a masssive enough stat under goes supernova. Neutron stars are very dense, for a comparison Teaspoon material of neutron star will weight more than that of entire earth\u2019s population! Although they are very dense they do not have very large radius(less than 30km). So a finally defination of neutron star will sum up as:- \u201cNeutron star is a celestial object of very small radius (typically 30 km) and very high density, composed predominantly of closely packed neutrons. Neutron stars are thought to form by the gravitational collapse of the remnant of a massive star after a supernova explosion, provided that the star is insufficiently massive to produce a black hole.\u201d  (A neutron star emitting pulsar) Pulsar:- As you can notice in the above picture the two flecking light, they are pulsar, they are emitted when a neutron rotating at a very high speed loses energy.

            "answer_text": "Quasar A quasar is a galactic nucleus, comprised of a black hole surrounded by a very luminous accretion disk. Quasars are very distant objects, and were prevalent in our universe only in the beginning times. They are very distant objects and hence their light is red-shifted heavily. Neutron star A neutron star is the remnant of the core of a collapsed star, for stars whose mass is enumerated within the TOV[1] limit. Typically, neutron stars are very small but have masses between 10\u201330 M\u2609\u2609. Pulsar A pulsar is a magnetized neutron star or white dwarf which rotates at very high angular speeds\u2014i.e., pulsates. They have very precise intervals between their pulses, which makes them really good tools for making accurate measurements. Footnotes[1] Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit - Wikipedia",
