            "answer_text": "Criminology is about examining why people commit crime is very important in the ongoing debate of how crime should be handled and prevented. Many theories have emerged over the years, and they continue to be explored, individually and in combination, as criminologists seek the best solutions in ultimately reducing types and levels of crime. Here is a broad overview of some key theories: Rational choice theory: People generally act in their self-interest and make decisions to commit crime after weighing the potential risks (including getting caught and punished) against the rewards. Social disorganization theory: A person\u2019s physical and social environments are primarily responsible for the behavioral choices that person makes. In particular, a neighborhood that has fraying social structures is more likely to have high crime rates. Such a neighborhood may have poor schools, vacant and vandalized buildings, high unemployment, and a mix of commercial and residential property. Strain theory: Most people have similar aspirations, but they don\u2019t all have the same opportunities or abilities. When people fail to achieve society\u2019s expectations through approved means such as hard work and delayed gratification, they may attempt to achieve success through crime. Social learning theory: People develop motivation to commit crime and the skills to commit crime through the people they associate with. Social control theory: Most people would commit crime if not for the controls that society places on individuals through institutions such as schools, workplaces, churches, and families. Labeling theory: People in power decide what acts are crimes, and the act of labeling someone a criminal is what makes him a criminal. Once a person is labeled a criminal, society takes away his opportunities, which may ultimately lead to more criminal behavior. Biology, genetics, and evolution: Poor diet, mental illness, bad brain chemistry, and even evolutionary rewards for aggressive criminal conduct have been proposed as explanations for crime. ",

            "answer_text": "Criminology just like other social sciences is introduced in class course work as part of the disciplines that emerged out of the period when man or human kind began to think rationally and scientifically(the enlightenment period). That is to say, that there were scientific reasons why some people committed crime, and that it was not out of demonic influence as earlier believed. It is studied in order to find out about what crime really is and why it occurred in the various forms, ways, manner and times it did. And to find ways of alleviating it. The introductory texts about crime likens the old ways of crime and the new ways of looking at crime in society. These texts also dwells on how crime and criminal suspects were dealt with in alleviating this vice. Another underlying factor for studying crime we learnt, was to be able to appreciate the human behavioral tendencies to commit crime in connection with their respective social, physical and psychological environment. Lastly but not the least, crime was a human activity that was bound to exist in our society given the fact that humans are different in their thinking, make up, interests,and that they live in different conditions that since they have been brought up differently when young, are therefore often bound to adapt differently later in life .
