            "answer_text": "So fun fact: The atomic numbers are not just there for \u201ccounting the elements\u201d. Let\u2019s take a look:  Periodic tables are set up the way they are because there are trends that make categorizing these elements a lot easier. For example, Noble gases are in Column 8 (18) and halogens are column 7 (17). Let\u2019s look at a specific atom. Pick one. Any one. Let\u2019s use an easy one for starters:  Hydrogen (H) has the atomic number 1. Why? Because it has 1 proton and, in a neutral atom, it also has 1 electron. But the primary purpose aside from organization is the number of protons in the atom. Why is this significant? What makes the number of protons so important? Well, let\u2019s look at another common atom:  So here is helium (He). It has the atomic number of 2. Meaning it has 2 protons and, in a neutral state, it has 2 electrons. Compared to Hydrogen, it has one more proton. Helium and Hydrogen are NOT THE SAME. Even though the difference is one proton, the properties of these two atoms are vastly different because of it. Helium is a noble gas, meaning that it isn\u2019t very reactive and pretty stable. Because of this, it is not flammable, hence why we use it in balloons. Hydrogen is NOT a noble gas. You know what happens when hydrogen gas is exposed to the air? It burns. Why? Hydrogen gas is higly unstable. The significance of atomic numbers are essentially what differentiate one atom from another. What makes atoms unique is their number of protons because the number of protons dictates what element that atom is! If you add a proton to a hydrogen atom you don\u2019t have hydrogen anymore. You have helium. Throw in 5 more and you get Nitrogen. Take away 2 and you get Lithium. Each one has different properties and prefers different structures which lead to many of the amazing things we can create. Atomic numbers 1 and 10 are two VERY different atoms. So it\u2019s not really something you want to mix up. ",

            "answer_text": "Atomic numbers tell us a great number of things in chemistry. Firstly, they tell us the number of protons (and therefore electrons) in an atom. Atoms in vertical groups have certain trends. Take Group I alkali metals for instance. They are in Group 1 hence they react violently, especially with water. Reactivity increases down the group. Each atom has one electron in the outer energy level hence atomic number follows a trend (it increases by 8 each time and by 18 further down the group). Atomic number also enables comparisons between atoms. The periodic table is set up such that the element on the right has one more proton in the nucleus. Thus in a period, an atom with a greater atomic number will have a smaller atomic radius since there will be greater nuclear charge in the nucleus that attracts the electrons. Atomic number determines reactivity, can help in evaluating intermolecular and intramolecular forces, size of an atom, the type of bonding, and much more. Hope this answers your question. ",
