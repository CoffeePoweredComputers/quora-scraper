            "answer_text": "Most of the energy available at the surface of the Earth comes not from the Earth, although our core is still quite molten and quite radioactive, but from the Sun. The primary way that energy gets to us is via radiation. Our atmosphere is transparent to most forms of that radiation, meaning a lot of energy reaches the ground level, where it is absorbed, raising the temperature of the ground and the ground warms the air in contact with it and near it. So, that sets up a general trend of the air near the ground being the hottest air and the temperature of the air slowly (rapidly?) cools as altitude above the ground increases. The problem is, that air is not static. It\u2019s highly dynamic, moving, churning, mixing. It\u2019s entirely possible for a huge bolus of hot air near the ground to rise up into the sky, as hot air is want to do, where it is then blown by high level winds laterally, where it is still warmer than the air that is now underneath it. There, the temperature of the air above the ground goes down, then back up again, then back down as you get above that bolus of hot air. Also, remember I said that the atmosphere is transparent to most forms of radiation. There is radiation, cosmic or solar, to which the constituents of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is less than transparent. UV radiation loves oxygen molecules. It will gleefully take three O2 molecules in the upper atmosphere and convert them to two O3, ozone, molecules. These ozone molecules will again absorb UV light and get warmer. Again, this is in the upper atmosphere. Remember how climatologists and oncologists warn that pollution that depletes the ozone layer will cause more skin cancers? That\u2019s because that high-level ozone helps keep as much UV light from reaching the ground, where oncologists and climatologists live. There are also bands of gasses in the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere that collect radioactive dust and gas. These are called the Van Allen Radiation Belts. While they are filled with molecules that are busy decaying , they are emitting radiation that heats up the surrounding air, making them not just hot radioactively, but also hot(ter) thermally, in the sense of this question. This answer so far is specific to thermal inversions in the gaseous atmosphere above us. It\u2019s similarly applicable to the liquid oceans below. Ocean currents can bring warm surface waters deep and ocean floor volcanism can warm deep water under cold waters. ",
