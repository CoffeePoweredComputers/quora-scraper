            "answer_text": "There are some, although most of them are straw men arguments. Many people say that Dennett does deny the existence of a conscious experience, but this is wrongheaded. Dennett merely denies one kind of experience. In particular, he denies the inexplicable and magical essence of qualia. He says that there are no such irreducible fundamental phenomena. There, Dennett invokes arguments from neuroscience and cognitive science which reduce qualia to the activity of the visual cortex, etc. For Dennett, the experience is real, and consciousness is real, but it is not what we think it is. Experience comes to us an illusion, a trick of the brain which implements this illusion for us. This is actually very post-Kantian, where experience is an illusion, but there are real things behind the experience. It is very aligned with neuroscience. For instance, modern science tells us that colors don\u2019t really exist anywhere and there are only wavelengths or frequencies that retina cones are receiving. Those get interpreted as different colors, but there is no necessity of those frequencies to be interpreted this or that way. Colors don\u2019t actually exist anywhere in the world[1], they are useful illusions of our brains to make us fit for survival. The reason we see some frequency x as red is because of evolutionary predispositions (i.e. color red is alertness). Such is also the case with other qualia, or the concept of free will, in Dennett\u2019s view. Among philosophers, Galen Strawson wrote a piece on Dennett under the title Consciousness Deniers[2]. In this essay, however, Strawson displayed a lack of understanding of Dennett\u2019s philosophy. After Dennett replied[3], he somehow corrected himself, but still, the situation was quite embarrassing. Strawson\u2019s charge was, among others, that seeming is already an instance of conscious experience, so we cannot seem to have irreducible qualia. But this begs the question. First, seeming might as well for a functionalist be realized at a neural level as a sort of propositional function (i.e. XOR gate). It might as well be that seeming is just about the brain distinguishing the red from yellow, or uncertainty about it, and you are experiencing it because the brain decides that you should have direct accompanying experience of it. So, seeming is just a fancy function. Second, that experience is an illusion behind which there is real reality is a claim as old as religion. In fact, Vedanta philosophy uses a similar analogy in which the world is just a dream (Maya ), an illusion that we all live in. Vedanta attempts to reach the ultimate reality behind experience via meditation, but Dennett thinks that science is there to tell us about that reality. Surely, if you are seeing an oasis in the middle of the desert, you don\u2019t think it is some real existing thing just because you experience it; you know it only seems so but in reality, it is just a visual creation of the brain. You\u2019re having an illusory experience, and the experience of red isn\u2019t really very different; they\u2019re both not what is really going on. Dennett says that these perceptions can be justified and explained, and in fact, neuroscience already explains these very well. To conclude, the argument presented by Strawson\u2019s argument is rather superficial and emotional, but not very sound. Dennett\u2019s position is actually respectable among neuroscience and reductivists (which are now a majority in science). There are many illusionists and eliminativists in that field. My charge against eliminativism/illusionism is very different. I accept eliminativism as a sound theory. I just think that it fundamentally fails as something which aims at explaining what is real. The whole Dennett\u2019s slogan is, in the end that \u201c[experiences] are all real, just not what we think they are!\u201d because there is always something else actually going on. But what there really is going on? Neuroscience? Biology? Or Physics? Which one? Those too are illusions of something real. They are all not what we think they are, each one of them is in fact reducible to something else, something more real which can then, in turn, be explained away. And then what happens? This too, becomes not what we think it is because what really happens is something at the physical level. But what is exactly there at a physical level? Realm of mathematical abstractions and point particles that cannot even have spatial representation. Is this what is really real? It can\u2019t be unless we\u2019re all mistaken. Most respectable physicists even discourage anyone from visualizing fields and particles, not to mention considering those a reality. If not, and we are to accept this, then what becomes of the whole concept of reality that we live in? Eliminativism, taken to its conclusive end, pretty much has to conclude there really isn\u2019t anything at all, maybe apart from some \u201cthird-person\u201d abstractions in the realm of science (i.e. physics). But this seems very nonsensical, we know this false by experiencing a wholly different reality. In such reductionism there is total casual drainage; nothing becomes efficacious apart from low-level physics, which is a rock-bottom realm. It is rock-bottom nihilism. Besides, what decides that reality should be a realm of neuroscience, if that too, is some illusion of a conscious subject; an illusion that can be explained away? I can say that: It only seems to you that there are axons, dendrites and neurons, but what really happens is this: (insert some physicist\u2019s explanation here) Dennett, along with Churchlands makes claims about neuroscience or cognitive science explaining consciousness and telling us what is real, and what is really happening. To me, as indicated above, these choices are very arbitrary. You can pick any domain and deny that this is in fact the correct description of reality. So, why does Dennett (et al) think that this should be considered a viable explanatory instrument? In the end, it is all fool\u2019s errand, and we end up at very counterintuitive conclusions. We either hold tight that some arbitrary domain like neuroscience becomes our explanatory vehicle, or accept that particle physics can ultimately explain anything about the world, and everything else is wrongheaded. There was actually a good joke I once found on the internet that describes these issues. I am going to steal it from Youtube: Eliminative materialism = The claim that: 1. That which is experienced, and that which is experiencing is not real. 2. That which is not experienced is the only thing that is real.\" Example: According to Eliminative materialism Christmas gifts and the joy children experience when they open the gifts are not real. The only thing that is real is Santa Claus. To conclude, if someone tells us that our experiences are not what we think there is, we can laugh. My experience is the only real thing in the world that I can vouch for. The most certain thing about the world is that I am having a conscious experience of it. I know everything through my experience, not the other way around. Without my subjective experience, I can have no knowledge of anything at all. What is real is the image that is constructed by our brains which are shared by many perceivers, not some otherworldly realm of neurons and axons, or particles that cannot be perceived at all.

            "answer_text": "One criticism I've heard is that Consciousness Explained should really be called 'Consciousness Explained Away' because Dennett claims there is no 'hard problem of consciousness' as consciousness is an illusion but if we ponder the question 'Could I not be conscious?' we realise that our very asking negates a 'yes' answer because it would be impossible to answer 'no' & for this answer to be true too! - But this would be to misunderstand what Dennett means by 'an illusion' - he doesn't deny that consciousness has existence as a phenomenon, it's just that the phenomena isn't what it seems to be: a ghost in the machine. It is simply brain function assessing brain function & nothing more. ",

Dennett is not considered \"one of the most influential yet radical philosophers in America today\" for no reason, and his arguments are at least as hard to critique as they are to fully understand. (disclaimer: I don't claim to fully understand Dennett though it is fun to try. I also have friends who are professors of philosophy and I often struggle to keep up with them. (Why do I hang out with philosophers? That's a good question. :)) ",
