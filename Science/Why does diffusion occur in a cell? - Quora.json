            "answer_text": "Diffusion is when a molecule moves down its concentration gradient \u2014 from an area of high concentration to an area of lower concentration. The ultimate goal is to reach equilibrium, where both sides have an equal concentration of the molecule. Molecules naturally move around. If there are two areas with molecules moving around randomly, and one area has more molecules than the other, there\u2019s simply a higher chance that the molecules from the higher concentration area will move into the lower concentration region. That doesn\u2019t mean that molecules from the lower concentration area will never move back into the higher concentration area \u2014 it simply means that the net, or overall, effect is that more molecules will move from the higher concentration area to the lower concentration area. Eventually, both sides will have an equal concentration, and the molecules will be moving back and forth at an equal rate. ",

            "answer_text": "Diffusion is a physical phenomenon which takes place whenever a concentration gradient for a substance is there. In diffusion, a substance or more specifically, the molecules of that substance move from their region of higher concentration to the region of their lower concentration when place in a fluid. So in cells it is but natural that diffusion occurs. However, not all substances diffuse in or out of the cells because of the special \u2018selectively semi-permeable\u2019 nature of the cell membrane. Therefore, along with diffusion, there are many other transport processes like osmosis, facilitated diffusion, active transport etc. ",
