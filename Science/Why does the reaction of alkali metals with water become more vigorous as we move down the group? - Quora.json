            "answer_text": "If you look at the configuration of any alkali metal you will find that the s-orbital of any alkali metal M will have one electron rather than 2. Hence it will make the atom reactive towards polar solvents. When any alkali metal M will react with water, it will readily give off its electron and will become positively charged. Due to polarity in water molecule OH will have partial negative and H will have partial positive charge. This negative charge will attract K+ ions and will combine to form MOH i.e alkali hydroxide. The H+ ions will combine to form hydrogen gas and will be given off. This whole process will be very spontaneous. You can google it up for more details. ",
