            "answer_text": "Not really, no. In colleges, organic chemistry is often considered as a \"weed-out\" course. So naturally, you see a higher drop rate. That doesn't mean the course itself is hard. It just means those students are not yet ready for upper level course work or that they need to change their approach. More often than not, students try to memorize organic chemistry, which is a HUGE mistake. The reason why there's a specific field dedicated to carbon based compounds is that there are more carbon based compounds than all the other compounds combined. So they're attempting an impossible task. There are few things to keep in mind when studying organic chemistry. I'm going to generalize a little bit. There are exceptions. Long carbon chains are inert. They don't participate in reactions. The functional groups do. In fact, in most reactions you will see the long carbon chains labeled as just \"R\" because it doesn't really matter. So when you see a huge molecule with large alkyl groups, don't feel intimidated.When in doubt, the answer is steric hindrance. Okay, this is a little bit of over generalizing. But you'd be surprised at how many times you end up uttering those words during organic chemistry.Being able to imagine the 3 dimensional structure of a molecule in your head can help you a great deal. There are molecular modeling kits available and some professors will even let you bring one to the exams.What you learned in general chemistry is key to understanding organic chemistry, which is not surprising. You won't necessarily be dealing with mole calculations and such. But concepts like electronegativity are very useful.Practice drawing resonance hybrids and mechanisms. They often follow the general rules. Positives attracts negatives. if you have an isolated positive charge, the surrounding electronegative atoms can stabilize the positive charge for a certain extent.As you increase the size of the molecule, you increase the boiling point (due to Van Der Waals interactions between molecules.) Not only that they are likely to be hydrophobic due to large dominating carbon chains, despite having few charges or polar groups.The stability of a carbocation increases as you increase the number of alkyl groups attached to it. This again comes to stabilizing the positive charge. Don't worry too much if you don't recognize some words I've used. You will definitely learn about them. This is by no means an exhaustive list. Try to find patterns that make sense to you. It's not necessarily an easy subject, you will need to work for it. But definitely not hard either. Organic chemistry comes in very handy if/when you're studying biochemistry. If you don't have a strong understanding of organic chemistry, biochemistry is going to be challenging. Most of the biological molecules are organic compounds. Thus they rely on your organic knowledge to understand, for instance, how metabolism works. Make use of your professors office hours. A one-on-one session never hurts. When you start organic chemistry, leave the prejudice outside the door. If you walk into the class thinking it's going to be awful, it will be awful.  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cOrgo\u201d is the weedout course in a lot of pre Med programs. Grading is notoriously tough - the average grade is often below B. A grade of C in Orgo can doom a pre med\u2019s chances. Pre meds know this. Most try very hard to earn a high grade in a course in which high grades are scarce. In my Orgo course, on the last day of class one student asked what would be covered on the final exam only three days later. The professor simply picked up our 1200 page textbook and said \u201cthis.\u201d He then added a bit of good news. He reminded us that we had had six tests, 10 quizzes, two dozen graded lab reports and spent about 500 hours studying. There was nothing we could do in three days to make up for any shortcomings in a year\u2019s preparation. Exams are very hard. A grade of 80% often warrants an A. As a graduate TA in Orgo, I would grade exams. Many of the students had never had a grade below A in a science course. Some of these students would not only flunk exams but get a grade of zero. Students would sometimes come to me in tears because they had lost five points over a stupid mistake. To do well requires a lot of time. Three hours of study per hour of lecture was a minimum. For those who wanted A\u2019s, five to seven hours was the norm. Once a student gets behind or has to make up ground from a low grade, getting back into the upper reaches of the class is very difficult. Recall that the students who are doing the best are already putting in 5\u20137 hours studying per hour of lecture. Those who are aiming for medical school take no chances. They do all the required assignments and then all the optional assignments. Many will read ahead to ensure that that they don\u2019t get blindsided by an unexpected demand on their time. There is no box to check that says \u201cI got a D on this test because I had the flu\u201d or \u201cmy car broken down\u201d or \u201cI had a physics exam the same day.\u201d Some students like Organic Chemistry. This doesn\u2019t make it easy. It just makes it possible to spend an entire Saturday or weekend doing nothing but studying Orgo. ",
