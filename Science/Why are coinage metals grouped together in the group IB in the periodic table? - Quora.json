            "answer_text": "Copper, silver and gold have some similarities in their chemical properties - they are less chemically active than many other metals and therefore remain \u201cshiny\u201d for longer (especially silver and gold), making them suitable for coinage - the coins remain \u201cshiny\u201d if they are kept clean and do not fall apart. They are also easier to mine than, say, iron, tin or aluminium, because they are more likely to be found as pure metal or relatively easily processed ores (again, especially silver and gold). This means that they were the first \u201cshiny metals\u201d ancient civilizations found, and became valued. So it would be more accurate to say that the properties of the group IB metals make them useful for coinage, rather than that the coinage metals are coincidentally found in group IB. ",

            "answer_text": "The coinage metals are in Group 11 not 1b. They are part of a larger group called the transition metals. The name \"coinage metals\" is often used in casual speech to refer to Gold, Silver and Copper, but various countries have used many other metals in coinage including aluminum , lead, nickel and zinc. In fact copper pennies in the USA are now mostly zinc. Coinage metals is not a scientific term and their position in the periodic table is due to their chemical properties not due to the fact that they are often used in coinage. ",
