            "answer_text": "I want to start my question with something very interesting.  Millions of Indian students fail either in NEET Or IITs every year and only thousands of them move forward.

As I promised that I would discuss THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ONCE YOU SEE ALL THESE OPTIONS. Now, I WOULD TALK ABOUT THE MARKET SITUATIONS AND WHAT ACTUALLY IS HELPING AROUND IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT AND HOW TO SAFEGUARD YOUR INTEREST DURING THESE TIMES. Bio Technology/Microbiology/In fact entire Life Sciences subjects are the poorest performing educational stream of this country as of now. Handful of jobs are available in this field.Just because one couldn\u2019t crack NEET, should not take these branches unconsciously. THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THESE STREAMS AND YOUR MEDICAL ASPIRATIONS.Students take these branches to avoid competition and showing that they are not the part of crowd and doing different. One thing we must accept that India is a sub continent and there are around 10000 students who think exactly the way you are thinking. Above it, the branch is having very limited employability in the market.Engineering / Medicine are no longer a career for guaranteed success. The industry scenario is changing rapidly. Now, Engineering is one of the qualifications generating more unemployed graduates.Front Page advertisements with 100 faces that got selected last year in NEET/IIT JEE do not establish that Bio and Maths are the only two lucrative career streams available in this country.Now all subjects/career options and streams like Biotechnology, Biomedical, Mechatronics and all the courses/branches which took birth in the past 10 - 20 years are having a tremendous scope. That is why they came into existence. So rather than asking for scope, the important thing to ask is how these courses/branches are performing on the ground level? What are the challenges graduates facing? Is market having enough career options available for the graduates of these courses/branches?Most important, while you shouldn't make your choice solely on an occupation's appearance on a \"best careers list,\" because to ignore employment outlook is sheer carelessness.If possible, opt for conventional courses as they would always have their market validity. Education is one of the biggest consumer markets now. Majority of University/Colleges/Institutions (Including the so-called big brands) are clueless about their existence now. Their aim is to have as many students possible to for their existence in the market and financially profitable. Because of this, one day they may come up / launch amusing courses like: \u201cMBA in Music Management Or MBA in Biotechnotronicsology?\u201d It is like \u201cyou name it, we have it\u201d But as a Parent and as a student, always stay away from fanciful experiments with your career.Find out about yourself first. Assess your personality, strengths, weaknesses etc.In short, we would strongly advise that take any of the course/stream after 12th PCB in 2 situations, 1. When you are very passionate and carve your way on your own. In this case you wouldn't ask this question at all. 2. Coming from affluent background and degree is required for marriage only. Don\u2019t experiment with these so called new age courses/branches if: 1. Moderate family background/service class family 2. You are expected to be the bread winner as soon as you finish the college 3. On loan\u2026 Not recommended at all Broker/admission agents/counsellors at colleges/universities are having targets and they need money to live too. But its upto you to be conscious while taking any decision.  Career Consciousness is utmost required before making the most important decision of life.  We can understand it as the state of being awake, thinking, and knowing what is actually happening in the Occupations/jobs/professions that you want to pursue for a significant period of life and with the opportunities for growth. If you share this quora post, believe me it would save and impact 10 lives in your sphere of influence\u2026 I wish you all the best! Kirti ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a common but extremely useful question, as many people who take up PCB in class 11th have little to no clue as to what other options do they have in case they decide to not go ahead with medicine. To start off with, let me give you a little context on careers. I\u2019m attaching a chart I made for someone asking help for non-technical careers after PCM, but I guess I can tweak it a little to suit our needs here:  As you can see (once you zoom in), the non-MEDICINE part of the chart shows you 3 most prominent career prospects should you choose to not go ahead with MBBS but still stick to the biology/chemistry stream: PHARMACY (B.Pharma - 4yrs)This is one career that is rarely affected by external factors. Whether the economy is up or down, no one ever stops taking medicine, which is why there\u2019s a demand to fulfill by these pharma companies.In today\u2019s times there are even 5 year Integrated Courses called MBA-Pharma Tech, which provide you a B.Pharma AND an MBA, hence saving 1 year of college and expenses (if that matters).The one important thing here is that if this is the line you choose to get into, then make sure that your interest in Chemistry is second to none.LIFE SCIENCESThese are the courses that deep-dive into the core subjects of biology from a research point of view. For example, in times like these where this Corona virus is breaking out, do you think it is the doctors who are coming up with a cure? NO! The people working on that are a mix of doctors, pharma specialists, & RESEARCHERS. These researchers can be people from various fields of study. The degree awarded for most of these courses is a BSc (3 years). However, there are prestigious research institutes like IISC, IISER, NISER, etc. which award a BS-MS degree (5 year) after their integrated courses. Some of the courses available under this:i. Zoologyii. Botanyiii. Micro-Biologyiv. Bio-Technologyv. Geneticsvi. AnthropologyFOOD & AGRICULTUREThis field is simply not just about harvesting, crops, seeds, pesticides etc., but also delves into the aspects of trading, feasibility studies, food processing, marketing as well as economics. If the prospect of getting into the management or the business side of the agriculture interests you, then the relatively new courses like BSc in Agriculture Business Management may interest you. Specializations in the field are - Food Science, Plant Science, Animal Science and Soil Science. With the demand for improvement of the food quality and production techniques it has led to a career gateway for the interested students to pursue this course. Candidates must have had Science with biology at 10+2 level for this course. Some institutions also have admissions via entrance tests. Top recruiting companies- ICRISAT, Indian Agriculture Research Institute and many more. Trending fields - Agriculture Scientists, Agronomy.Courses offered under this are:i. Food Science & Engineeringii. Horticultureiii. Agricultural Engineeringiv. Soil Sciencev. Dairy Technologyvi. Plant Breeding & Geneticsvii. Agricultural Biotechnologyviii. Agronomyix. BBA in Agricultural ScienceALLIED MEDICINEEver been to a hospital? Is it just doctors that we see there? No, right? So who are all these other people?Allied Medicine are those courses that help you work in the hospital in the capacity to assist the doctors and other specialists with their work. The degree is a BSc in the respective field of study. A few of such fields are:i. Nursesii. Radiologyiii. Optometryiv. Physiotherapyv. Nutritionist / Dietitianvi. Psychologyvii. ForensicsOther than this, there\u2019s a whole world of careers out there that you can explore if you don\u2019t want anything with sciences. Go back to the image above. See that section with the 5 \u201cTechnical\u201d careers? Other than those (where either Maths or a combination of Phy+Maths is compulsory), all the \u201cNon-Technical\u201d careers are completely open for you as well. I think one of the other answers here has tried to cover some of them also. In any case, here\u2019s another list of off-beat careers that are open for you despite the fact that you finished 12th with PCB: Designer (B.Des)Management (BMS)Psychologist (Psych Honours)Marketing & Advertisement (BMS / BMM / BJMC + MBA)Hospitality (Hotel Management / Tourism / etc.)Socio-Political Analyst (Pol Sci Honours / Sociology Honours / International Relations in PG / Anthropology Honours / etc.)Journalist / Editor / Content Manager (BJMC / BMM)Lawyer (BA-LLB)And that\u2019s just the tip of the ice-berg. There\u2019s so many things that you can do. All you need is to look inside yourself and ask yourself what is that really gets you going. Once you find your passion, there\u2019s no stopping you from becoming whatever it is that you want to become. I think I may even have an article or two that can help clarify things a little more. If you think you want any further clarification from my end then just drop a comment and I\u2019ll try my best to help. Regards! ",

            "answer_text": "Nowadays, asides medicine, there are a lot many career opportunities available for students who have opted for PCB (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology) in their class 12th. It is not necessary for class 12th PCB pass-outs to opt only for MBBS as their career option. Below I have mentioned a few of the other trending careers that requires PCB as a baseline in class 12th and has a parallel standing in terms of recognition and job openings in India and outside. Bachelor in Business Management (BBA) and Masters in Business Management (MBA): Many colleges and universities in India do not consider mathematics as a mandatory subject in order to apply for its BBA and MBA programme. Colleges like SP Jain School of Global Management or Christ University - Bangalore opens BBA for students from any stream, say with PCB.Bachelor of Science - Class 12th students with PCB can open their career prospect towards Bsc programmes like Forestry, Fishery Science ,Wildlife Marine biology, Food and Nutrition, Zoology, Food Technology, and the likes. Opting any of these Bsc courses will open various gates for PCB candidates willing to go for courses asides medicine.Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)- Students with PCB can very well opt for humanities related courses in their graduation, namely in the field of Mass Communication and Journalism, Bachelors in English leading to the designation of a Lecturer or Proof Reader can also be sought after. Also, B.Ed., CTET, or NET can be given if a student wants to indulge in the field of teaching. Alongside the above, Travel & Tourism Courses furthering the prospect of career in Tourism, Archaeology (specialization in say Medieval History offers lucrative career prospects outside India), Sociology among many others offers a range of career opportunities.Diploma Courses- Students opting for diploma courses in Merchant Navy, Event Management, Hotel Management can too indulge in a field of lucrative career prospects. Nowadays, high payroll Event Managers are on a rise. Colleges like National Academy of Event Management and Development (NAEMD) or National Institute of Event Management (NIEM) offers diploma course \u2018Diploma in Event Management (DEM)\u2019.That said, it is important to understand that following the trend is not always a smart move. What I mean to say is, opting for MBBS or BDS post your class 12th is not the only option available. Education in India is opening its door for various other career options to choose from. One can always indulge into something which is new and has a rising career opening to it, provided proper research regarding the same has been done. ",

            "answer_text": "There are homeopathic, ayurvedic, alternative medicine courses,agriculture, etc. But in pure sciences there are not plenty but quite a few options. Eligibility Criteria UoH has an integrated course which is VERY GOOD. OPEN FOR PCB but has maths in its ENTRANCE EXAM. all 4 subjects (including MATH).. you can even find question papers online. (check out the systems biology course - maybe the first for UG)Similar integrated MSc courses are offered in various universities and research institutes which are good.. check out for them in research institutes' websites.. one example is here Integrated M.Sc. Programme Highlights - Institute of Life Sciences the iisc programme is very prestigious.. but needs a math background as in mpc. so i suppose will do only if you have a pcmb  IISc UG - Information Brochure IISERs are very promising because there are more number of seats. Here again they take both pcm and pub but exam will have all pcmb subjects. SO U HAVE TO LEARN MATHS FOR THE PAPER IISER Admission 2015 Apart from these you can take up BSc courses in zoology, botany and the like. The ones cited above offer Biology as such. You could consider going abroad - will be costly but there are many scholarships for foreign students especially for non medical courses like boomed and biotech.. but for science equally good opportunities are there here :)All the best :D ",

Rather, they don't know that there are many more branches that are biology related and thus fail to value degrees other than medical. A double degree in Biology (B.Sc and M.Sc) can make you eligible for post of a teacher in schools or lecturer in degree colleges. You can also do side-by-side research some topic, obtain P.Hd and be at a higher post! You can have scope in heading organisations and research institutes if do do good in your field. A B.Tech degree in Biotechnology is also of much importance. You can be related to improving agriculture methods like effective fertilizer development. Research on use of microbes and bacteria is taking progress as their importance is building up. So likewise, if you just google up, you can find several career opinions related to biology, other than medical, and there is a lot of chance of progress in these fields. All the best! ",

KVPY(Kishore Vygyanik Protsahan Yojna)- If you qualify in this, you can get in to IISc Bangalore, where you can do BSc and then MSc. It\u2019s a very very prestigious place and you have a work a lot for KVPY!NEST(National Entrance Screening Test)- It is also a national level exam where you are offered 5 year intergrated BSc+MSc in basic sciences in either UM-DAE, Mumbai or NISER, Bhubaneshwar (You can have more information about it in it\u2019s offcial website).NEET(National Eligibility Entrance Test) - This is not only for MBBS. You can get into any good university for BSc in basic sciences or BTech in biotechnology or Genetics through your NEET rankAccording to my knowledge, these three are useful for a PCB student, who is not into MBBS. Note: All these exams need immense hard work and dedication. It\u2019s easy to aspire but it\u2019s really hard to get into these prestigious universities. All the very best :) ",
