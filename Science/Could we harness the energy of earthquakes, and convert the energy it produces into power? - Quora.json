            "answer_text": "In principle, I am sure the answer is yes. As soon as you say lets get started then- the problems emerge. Obvious strategies are to build earthquake energy capture devices over an entire fault so that when the earth quake happens , you have the apparatus in place to capture the energy. Then you think of the cost, the fact that the fault maybe thousands of miles long but earthquakes are in frequent and often useful energy would be confined to say tens of miles around the eathquake\u2019s epicentre. The other problem is related to the collection of the energy.You will need the earthquake to do work (force x distance) on your energy capturing device. The problem is that the earthquakes energy comes in the form of very large forces which move quite small distances. This means that your capturing mechanism is going to have something which is very hard to move (can make use of the large force) but when it is moved a short distance, you will be able to recover the energy it gained. This will tend to make the collection apparatus be very large and very expensive even for a small location. A simple example, you think a fault will raise the ground in one area when the fault moves. The earth quake happens and the land rises 30cm (1 foot). Your capture device could be somethink like a huge tank of water. Something like the size of a oil suspertanker ship. The earyth quake would have the stregth to lift this up. So you would have millions of galllons of water raised 30 cm higher than it wqas before- that is quite a lot of energy. However, extracting that energy is not easy - you would prefer to have 1/100 the amount of water raised 100 times higher - but that is not what you have got. A think the short answer is NO. ",

            "answer_text": "Could we harness the energy of earthquakes, and convert the energy it produces into power? IF \u201cthe energy of earthquakes\u201d is not interpreted to mean \u201cthe energy released when an earthquake takes place,\u201d but is (instead) considered to mean \u201cthe energy that goes into earthquakes,\u201d then it could be possible. Especially if it is an earthquake associated with a volcanic eruption. Development of the geothermal potential near volcanoes would not only produce energy, but it would cool the magma under the volcano. Such cooling would serve to stiffen the rock and defer a volcanic eruption. Instead of an earthquake releasing a vast amount of energy at once, the energy would be continuously withdrawn. ",

            "answer_text": "Earthquakes are semi-random events which occur mostly without warning.  It would be almost impossible to create a device which could capture even a tiny proportion of the diffuse energy released during an earthquake.  After the earthquake and aftershocks, you would have to decommission or move the infrastructure to another potential earthquake zone and set it up in hopes of having another earthquake.   Energy sources based upon natural disasters would probably have a poor chance of being funded by any corporation or government.  ",

            "answer_text": "The locations of the earthquake epicenters is too random to pre-locate something to do the harnessing and the length of time an earthquake happens is too short to move something there while it is happening. Also because they last such a short time, you probably couldn't get much energy out of it. So for practical purposes the answer is no. ",
