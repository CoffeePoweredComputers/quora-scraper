            "answer_text": "Fireplaces (real ones) as they\u2019re a hassle, get very dirty with ash immediately, often baffle the owners, and provide much less heat to a room than expected. People pay a premium for these (we\u2019d had 2 in my parents\u2019 house) and often don\u2019t have a significant amount of firewood on hand (maybe enough for 1 or 2 short duration fires.) Hot tubs and swimming pools oftentimes as they\u2019re more maintenance and cleaning that people anticipate or want to do, are often emptied out and dried for many more months per year than they considered (in my part of the country an outdoor pool is comfortable 60\u201390 days a year), and more expensive than they realized ($3,000\u201310,000/yr in water, chemicals, heat, pumping, filters, and maintenance care is typical.) Room for a few horses so a multi-acre site. They underestimate the cost of a decent barn, wildly underestimate or forget the fencing cost for those 3\u201325 acres, assume the horses will graze rather than need purchased feed throughout the year, need a few thousand dollars in saddles and other tack, need an average of $3,000 in veterinary care per horse per year, the horses cost more than they expected and need more exercise and daily care than recalled or known, and oh yeah, annual or more often horseshoeing and a horsetrailer with often a more powerful vehicle to pull it. The one that surprises me the most out of hundreds of homes (sister was a realtor as have been dozens of friends, I worked on hundreds a year in my security design days from quite modest to large estates, new construction to historic structures: far more bedrooms than people who will live there or even regularly visit. Empty nesters who buy enormous (4\u20136 bedroom homes or more) with children in their 30\u2019s on the odd hope they\u2019ll have many returning kids, grandkids, and friends staying with them that paying year round for a thousand square feet used at best a few days a year or less baffles me. Also taking on a much bigger house to clean and care for when the owners\u2019 physical health and energy have long ago peaked (and taking on a 30 year mortgage at 65\u2026) just seems foolish from what are usually smart, accomplished people.

            "answer_text": "Fireplaces. It's part of the fantasy, the romantic flickering light and gentle crackling. It's an attractive feature to buyers, and it's an expensive one to add to a home. Then life hits. Even if they don't chainsaw and split their own wood, preferring instead to just pay to have a face cord of seasoned hardwood delivered and stacked, the new owners discover that bringing in the wood from outside, starting and tending the fire, dealing with ash, etc. are not romantic chores. Personally I love a fireplace. When I lived up North I used them often. I love the smell. I find gas fireplaces to be an inadequate replacement. It's like discount frozen pizza versus a pizzeria in Naples. No, not even that good. I kinda like frozen pizza. ",
