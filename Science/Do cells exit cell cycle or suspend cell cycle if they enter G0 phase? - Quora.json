            "answer_text": "I think the cells suspend the cell cycle, because according to English dictionary suspend mean to stop something from being active , either temporarily or permanently. The cells in the G0 phase doesn't divide until they are called to do so. So that means cells in the G0 phase are temporarily arrested. But according to Ncert textbook \u201c the cells that do not divide further exit G1 phase to enter an inactive stage called G0 stage\u201d. Here it says the cells that do not divide exit G1 phase but the cells in G0 phase suspend the cell cycle. So according to me the answer should be suspend the cell cycle not exit ",
