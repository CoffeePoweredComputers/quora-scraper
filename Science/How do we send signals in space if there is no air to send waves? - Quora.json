            "answer_text": "Same question was asked on Reddit here. As a brief answer: radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation. It\u2019s like asking how light travels through space from the Sun to the Earth, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a physical thing. Radio waves consist of charged particles. Sound on the other hand is a compression wave, which just means particles in the air are bumping into each other until they bump into your ear drums. The pattern in which they hit your ear is how you interpret sound. ",

            "answer_text": "Noise requires a medium through which to travel. Sound travels in waves through air and water. Radio waves on the other hand require no medium to travel through. So light easily goes through the vacuum of space, however, soundwaves can not do so. In space truly no one can hear you scream! ",
