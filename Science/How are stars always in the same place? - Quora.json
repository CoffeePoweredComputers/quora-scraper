            "answer_text": "They\u2019re not. All of them are moving relative to us and relative to each other, and very fast. They appear not to be moving because they\u2019re so far away. Similar to when you\u2019re driving, and the lamp posts go by quickly but the distant mountains go by slowly. You\u2019re actually passing them both at the same speed, but the distance and perspective make it appear that the mountains are slower. Now think about driving and looking at the moon. That will seem not to be moving at all, because it\u2019nearly 250,000 miles away. And the sun, which is 93,000,000 miles away. When measuring the distance to a star, the usual measuring unit is the \u2018light year\u2019. One light year is 63,000 times farther than from Earth to the sun. That\u2019s 5,878,000,000,000 miles. And the very nearest star is 4.22 light year from Earth. How fast are the stars moving? Our own sun (dragging all the planets with it) is moving at 450,000 miles per hour around the galaxy (which itself is also moving, even faster, in the direction of the Andromeda galaxy). A \u2018fast\u2019 moving star can go as fast as 2,000,000 miles per hour. We just can\u2019t see that at this distance. ",

New Map Shows the Motion of all the Galaxies in Our Supercluster For almost a century, astronomers have understood that the Universe is in a state of expansion. This is a consequence of General Relativity, and the rate at which it is expanding is known as the Hubble Constant\u2013 named after the man who first noticed the phenomena. However, astronomers have also learned that withing the large-scale structures of the Universe, galaxies and clusters have also been moving closer and relative to one other. For decades, astronomers have sought to track how these movements have taken place over the course of cosmic history. And thanks to the efforts of international team of astronomers, the most detailed map to date of the orbits of galaxies that lie within the Virgo Supercluster has been created. This map encompasses the past motions of almost 1,400 galaxies within 100 million light years of space, showing how our cosmic neighborhood has changed. The study which details their research recently appeared in The Astrophysical Journal under the title \u201cAction Dynamics of the Local Supercluster\u201c. Led by Edward J. Shaya of the University of Maryland, the team included members from the UH Institute of Astronomy, the Racah Institute of Physics in Jerusalem, and the Institute for Research of the Fundamental Laws of the Universe (IRFU) in Paris.

Remember when you look at a star that is far away, you\u2019re effectively looking back in time. Light has to travel a great distance to reach your eyes, because of this you perceived the star as being stationary. ",

Its sideways angular motion is - if I remember correctly - a little under a second of arc a year. In an 80 year life it will move about 1 degree across the sky. Its motion is detectable with a good telescope, skill and patience. ",
