            "answer_text": "Can gills help fish to swim? I do not think so but it is a cool idea. Huh. I did some research to explain my position and found Jet propulsion - Wikipedia Some teleost fish have also developed jet propulsion, passing water through the gills to supplement fin-driven motion. I cannot find the linked book but only other locations with the same source.I tend to trust Wikipedia but I cannot see the original to check. My own position is that very few fish can use their gills to swim and I explain why below. I had felt \u2018no fish can use their gills to swim\u2019 and had nearly finished my answer before finding that bit on Wikipedia.  Fish do \u2018gulp\u2019 water and force it back through their gills and out. This looks like it could provide some propulsion, except, as far as I can see, the fish are not sucking water in. As the mouth opens, water does come from in front but also from the sides. The flow of water is slowed by passage through the gills and the operculum (the open for water to escape after it crosses the gills) is not shaped or focused to direct the flow. Because fish have other means of propulsion that are more effective, their gills and water flow through them seems to maximize amount of water, not directing that water. As you may know, octopi and squids and such do use, if not their gills, then their means of providing water to the gills, for propulsion. ",
