            "answer_text": "Allow me to offer a somewhat technical answer to this question (a good question, by the way). Yes, this means a bit of math. Hopefully not too off-putting. The so-called Lagrangian density functional that describes the electromagnetic field in classical physics is given by  where  is the electromagnetic 4-potential, , and  is the 4-current. In plain(er) English,  is the electromagnetic field;  is its rate of change; and  represents the electric properties of matter. As for the Lagrangian, its first term is kinetic energy; its second term is potential energy. In empty space, there is no matter. Which means there are no charges or currents: . The second part of the Lagrangian just evaporated. Poof! So all we are left with is the first part. Pure kinetic energy. Everything the electromagnetic field does in empty space is pure kinetic energy. And what does the electromagnetic field do in empty space? Well, it forms plane waves that propagate at the invariant velocity . That is to say, electromagnetic radiation, including that narrow part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can detect. So yes, light energy is pure kinetic energy. Potential energy, if present, is there because some matter is there and  is not zero. In short, potential energy is responsible for creating light, absorbing light, refracting light. But when light does not do any of these things, its energy is purely kinetic. This, by the way, has general validity going beyond light. Kinetic energy describes what things do when they are left alone; potential energy describes what happens when things interact. (A special case is when a thing interacts with itself, in which case the theory is said to be nonlinear. Light does not interact with itself, at least not in the classical theory.) ",

            "answer_text": "Light energy is free movement energy which includes both heat energy and kinetic energy. But it is not potential energy. Heat energy is a kind of kinetic energy --- vibration movement energy for microscopic particles. So it is kinetic energy. Photon has two type of energy in it: vibration movement energy mx and linear movement energy mc. E = mx + mc. p vibration = mx, x is the sum of the compounded vibration movements of photon, the frequency of this movement is f. x = h f / m. (\u2206E/\u2206f) f = p vibration, h f = p vibration, h = \u2206E/\u2206f. Refer to the newly integrated equation to describe the photon\u2019s mass --- energy, energy --- frequency relations: When v = c, E = p, p = p vibration + mc, make h c / \u03bb = p vibration, since c / \u03bb = f, h f = p vibration, so E = h f + mc, since \u2206E = \u2206p vibration, \u2206f \u221d \u2206 p vibration, (\u2206E/\u2206f) f = p vibration, h = \u2206E/\u2206f. assume x = compounded movements of p vibration, then mx = p vibration, x = h f / m. E = mx + mc. (12). The potential energy is the free movement energy stored in the structural position of mass or the space gravitational position of mass. Neither of these applies to photon: it has no structural energy in it. It depends on its momenta energy to keep its structure and its movement energy is way too big and its mass is way too small to be overcome by gravity in normal conditions though it does be affected by gravity. Structural position potential energy is expressed by E = mc\u00b2, which is a constant that cannot be used for describing the energy \u2013 mass relations of photons. And also it is not an equation that describe the free movement energy of energy state matter --- photon, but it is an equation that describe the universal structural position potential energy of mass state matter --- it is a very important equation to make us understand how this world work. But photon as an energy state matter doesn\u2019t have structural energy in it, it depends on its momenta to keep its structure stable and function. E = Gm\u2081m\u2082/r can be used to describe this space gravitational position potential energy relative to the local central black hole. Though it also can be symbolically illustrated as mv in momentum form. The m is the mass of the object relative to local central black hole; the v is the ideal final velocity to central black hole. This is the momentum expression to indirectly illustrate this space gravitational position potential energy. It is one item in the equation of universe level locked energy and free movement energy balance. This balance can be symbolically illustrate as\u2211 \u2206(mc\u00b2 + mv) = \u2211 \u2206(mx + mc), (16). This is a momentum equation. The momentum marker is mv. Other items are E = p, due to v = c condition. Due to the E directly proportional to the p, so KE = mv*v/2, p = mv, mv = KE*2/V. when you find p, you can find the corresponding KE and vice versa. ",
