            "answer_text": "Inexperience is a quality of the human condition. We are born one time only; we can never start a new life equipped with the experience we've gained from a previous one. We leave childhood without knowing what youth is; we marry without knowing what it is to be married; and even when we enter old age, we don't know what it is we're heading for: The old are innocent children of their old age. In that sense, man's world is the planet of inexperience. (Milan Kundera)  To begin with, it seems notable that to even frame the question in terms of being human feels strange. More than other creatures, it feels to us that we only know what it is like to be ourselves and not 'human' in general. When and where we were born, into what culture and which family, who we meet, what we like and what we do - these things shape the range of experiences we are familiar with and the capacities we develop.  In general, we are so fixated on our personal stories that 'being human' as a universal quality is typically known indirectly - as science and statistics, or through sentimental consideration from a distance. Our concrete experience of being strictly human is rather elusive and paradoxical. We find our humanity in a large crowd or public event, but we can also find it in solitude. We can find it in intimate gatherings with close friends, and through gritty struggles with reality, or through escaping in works of pure fiction. Humanity lurks in candid moments on a street and accidentally poetic turns of phrase, an encounter with an animal or even an insect. All of these experiences can rob us of a feeling of humanity as well, leaving us isolated and empty, insignificant, meaningless.  The overdeveloped sense of significance is at the heart of what is to be human. Arising from a profound awareness of our own incompleteness and inexperience, we compensate in many ways - some bold and treacherous, some vulnerable and curious. Our collective and personal shame and fear, together with love and aspiration, drive us like a bowstring pulled back to propel discovery and achievement, specialization, and grandeur. We see ourselves and our striving alternately as blessed and cursed, tragic, comic, proud, and pathetic - perpetually making the same shortsighted mistakes, yet perpetually improving and learning. It's easy to be ashamed to be part of a species which has spread so much horror and imprisonment around the world. Truly staggering crimes made routine and truly innocuous routines made criminal. At the same time, almost everything that we enjoy about being human can be attributed to other humans and their efforts over the centuries. Air conditioning? Indoor plumbing? Music?

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 What does it mean to be human? Or, putting the point a bit more precisely, what are we saying about others when we describe them as human? Answering this question is not as straightforward as it might appear. Minimally, to be human is to be one of us, but this begs the question of the class of creatures to which \u201cus\u201d refers. Can\u2019t we turn to science for an answer? Not really. Some paleoanthropologists identify the category of the human with the species Homo sapiens, others equate it with the whole genus Homo, some restrict it to the subspecies Homo sapiens sapiens, and a few take it to encompass the entire hominin lineage. These differences of opinion are not due to a scarcity of evidence. They are due to the absence of any conception of what sort of evidence can settle the question of which group or groups of primates should be counted as human. Biologists aren\u2019t equipped to tell us whether an organism is a human organism because \u201chuman\u201d is a folk category rather a scientific one. Some folk-categories correspond more or less precisely to scientific categories. To use a well-worn example, the folk category \u201cwater\u201d is coextensive with the scientific category \u201cH2O.\u201d But not every folk category is even approximately reducible to a scientific one. Consider the category \u201cweed.\u201d Weeds don\u2019t have any biological properties that distinguish them from non-weeds. In fact, one could know everything there is to know biologically about a plant, but still not know that it is a weed. So, at least in this respect, being human is more like being a weed than it is like being water. If this sounds strange to you, it is probably because you are already committed to one or another conception of the human (for example, that all and only members of Homo sapiens are human). However, claims like \u201can animal is human only if it is a member of the species Homo sapiens\u201d are stipulated rather than discovered. In deciding that all and only Homo sapiens are humans, one is expressing a preference about where the boundary separating humans from non-humans should be drawn, rather than discovering where such a boundary lays. If science can\u2019t give us an account of the human, why not turn to the folk for an answer? Unfortunately, this strategy multiplies the problem rather than resolving it. When we look at how ordinary people have used the term \u201chuman\u201d and its equivalents across cultures and throughout the span of history, we discover that often (maybe even typically) members of our species are explicitly excluded from the category of the human. It\u2019s well-known that the Nazis considered Jews to be non-human creatures (Untermenschen), and somewhat less well-known that fifteenth-century Spanish colonists took a similar stance towards the indigenous inhabitants of the Caribbean islands, as did North Americans toward enslaved Africans (my 2011 book Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others, gives many more examples). Another example is provided by the seemingly interminable debate about the moral permissibility of abortion, which almost always turns on the question of whether the embryo is a human being. At this point, it looks like the concept of the human is hopelessly confused. But looked at in the right way, it\u2019s possible to discern a deeper order in the seeming chaos. The picture only seems chaotic if one assumes that \u201chuman\u201d is supposed to designate a certain taxonomic category across the board (\u2018in every possible world\u2019 as philosophers like to say). But if we think of it as an indexical expression \u2013 a term that gets its content from the context in which it is uttered \u2013 a very different picture emerges. Paradigmatic indexical terms include words like \u201cnow,\u201d \u201chere,\u201d and \u201cI.\u201d Most words name exactly the same thing, irrespective of when, where, and by whom they are uttered. For instance, when anyone anywhere correctly uses the expression \u2018the Eiffel Tower,\u2019 they are naming one and the same architectural structure. In contrast, the word \u201cnow\u201d names the moment at which the word is uttered, the word \u201chere\u201d names the place where it is uttered, and the word \u201cI\u201d names the person uttering it. If I am right, the word \u201chuman\u201d works in much the same way that these words do. When we describe others as human, we are saying that they are members of our own kind or, more precisely, members of our own natural kind. What\u2019s a natural kind? The best way to wrap one\u2019s mind around the notion of natural kinds is to contrast them with artificial kinds. Airplane pilots are an artificial kind, as are Red Sox fans and residents of New Jersey, because they only exist in virtue of human linguistic and social practices, whereas natural kinds (for example, chemical elements and compounds, microphysical particles, and, more controversially, biological species) exist \u2018out there\u2019 in the world. Our concepts of natural are concepts that purport to correspond to the structural fault-lines of a mind-independent world. In Plato\u2019s vivid metaphor, they \u2018cut nature at its joints.\u2019 Weeds are an artificial kind, because they exist only in virtue of certain linguistic conventions and social practices, but pteridophyta (ferns) are a natural kind because, unlike weeds, their existence is insensitive to our linguistic conventions. Philosophers distinguish the linguistic meaning of indexical expressions from their content. The content of an indexical is whatever it names. For example, if you were to say \u2018I am here\u2019, the word \u2018here\u2019 names the spot where you are sitting. Its linguistic meaning is \u2018the place where I am when I utter the word \u201chere\u201d.\u2019 If \u2018human\u2019 means \u2018my own natural kind,\u2019 then referring to a being as human boils down to the assertion that the other is a member of the natural kind that the speaker believes herself to be. This goes a long way towards explaining why a statement of the form \u2018x is human,\u2019 in the mouth of a biologist might mean \u2018x is a member of the species Homo sapiens\u2019 while the very same statement in the mouth of a Nazi might mean \u2018x is a member of the Aryan race.\u2019 That's what it means to be human.
