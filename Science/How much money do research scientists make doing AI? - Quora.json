I wouldn't do it for the money if I was you I would do it because you love it otherwise I think that you kind of got to be already in club like Google where they're going to hire you and then tell you what you're doing for the rest of your life I don't want to spend my life making a machine that can play chess really good because that's what happened last time why don't you find a way to use the current open source technology open source and then do something cool with it it's marketing then you don't need to make it better you made me to make it appealing you need to think of an idea that puts the AI in a position that no one has thought of yet I should give you an idea why don't you make a picture frame links to the frick and cloud and the cloud dragon is linked to your Google photos thing the triangle colored one and then it has a little microphone on the picture frame and when certain words are associated with photos because Google does that shuffling and sorting thing strangely and frail on it so don't put any porn in your Google account it could overhear conversations and then change the photograph to some memory that people don't pull out photo albums my mom's taking thousands of pictures no one's ever going to pull those out unless they're like really invested in it but this way you get not just a random picture but a picture that is linked to some kind of notable conversation and you can have that a IV learning over time you can have it associated with like your Facebook updates God knows who knows you can have it talking to you you probably make an emotional attachment if you started a line of memory photo thing is better just basically photo frames picture frames like Kindle it's like a friggin $25 thing you can read any book on you want it's just an idea but put your AAA into it in it and Innovative way men ",

The problem is that marketeers are able to use the term to peddle their particular snakeoils. There is not shortage in AI systems in the world - you and I and everyone else are Ais so why would anyone pay to develop a replica of what you have already. The point of AI is understanding the nature of thought and awareness . This is research at the academic level. Mind you their salaries are often quite good. ",
