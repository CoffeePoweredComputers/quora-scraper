            "answer_text": "If you want to know if aging is a disease - you need to define disease.  There are lots of definitions of disease.  There are some who see 'illness' and 'disease' as being the same thing.  Others, see 'illness' as that which is presented by the patient, and disease as what is diagnosed by a doctor. A disease is a name given to a class of illnesses, with similar symptoms.  Is aging an illness? What is an illness? Again, there are lots of definitions. Some might classify aging as an illness - while others do not.  Here is a simple definition of an illness, which provides a clear answer: Illness - an abnormal, negative, health condition, with a cause, or causes.  Abnormal is, of course, a judgement call.  Is left handedness abnormal? If we look at many cultures, and across many centuries, left handedness has been seen as abnormal.  Of course abnormal might be beneficial.  It is possible to be abnormally strong, abnormally fast, or abnormally smart.  Negative is also a judgement.  What one person sees as positive, another might see as negative. Is left handedness negative? In a society where most people are right handed, left handedness can be negative in many cases, and positive in some cases.  Is aging abnormal?  Clearly not.  Aging is a normal fact of life.  Is aging negative?  No.  We are all concieved and then born about 9 months later. Aging, in a baby, in a child, is the process of growing up.  If a baby does not age, does not grow up, that's negative.  We might believe that, after we are 20, or 30, or so... Aging becomes negative. But the process, the natural process of aging has not changed - only our viewpoint, only our perception.  Does aging have a 'cause', or causes?  The cause of aging, frankly, is life.  As long as you are alive, you continue to age.  When you die, you stop aging.  Personally, I'd prefer to continue aging for as long as possible.  Aging is normal.  Aging is a positive aspect of life.  Aging is not an illness.  Therefore, aging is not a disease.  to your health, tracy ",

            "answer_text": "There are two groups of people in the gerontology field: The first group considers aging a normal part of life taking place in all species, albeit at a different rate. The elderly can suffer from diseases just like children. And just like in children, the elderly suffer more from certain diseases and these diseases manifest themselves differently. For example, heart attacks in the elderly are often silent and mimic digestive diseases. That's how geriatrics became a separate medical specialty. And (most) geriatricians will tell you they deal with pathological aging only. The second group considers aging a systemic disease. The diseases that often afflict the elderly are nothing more than syndromes of aging - you can group here the atherosclerotic syndromes and the neurodegenerative ones. Diabetes is a classical model of accelerated aging and most complications of diabetes take place in non-diabetic advanced-age elders. Viewing aging as a disease is the first step in doing something about it, dare I say find a cure?",
