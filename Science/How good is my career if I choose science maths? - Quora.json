            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Gaurav. Firstly, I would like to tell you that if you have a major inclination towards science and maths, then only opt for it. Don\u2019t opt for PCM under peer pressure or because it offers a broad spectrum of career choice ahead. Once you go for it, you\u2019ll regret it each day of your life if you aren\u2019t really passionate and focused about it. Now coming to your question, undoubtedly if you opt for PCM, you\u2019ve opened up way more options in your career ahead. You can go for Engineering, and then shape your career accordingly by later pursuing an MBA or an MS. If you get a really good college to pursue your engineering like the IITs or the NITs and you maintain a good CGPA in your college, you might end up bagging a decent job in a matter of just 4 years. Opting for PCM is a great option only if you are dedicated enough to work and study under pressure and deliver good results. Good Luck! ",
