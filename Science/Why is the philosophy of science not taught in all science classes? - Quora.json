            "answer_text": "Perhaps the main two reason that it is not taught in science classes are that: (1) philosophy of science isn\u2019t itself science; and (2) scientists have not traditionally relied on the philosophy of science in order to make their discoveries. Let\u2019s take each of these in turn: (1) Science is an empirical discipline - progress in science comes, at least in part, through observations of the natural world. Philosophy, on the other hand, is a discipline that examines concepts. Where science might ask \u201cwhat are the laws of heredity?\u201d, philosophy may ask \u201cwhat exactly is a scientific \u2018law\u2019?\u201d (or even \u201cwhat is science?\u201d). The latter questions - the philosophical questions - cannot be settled by experiment or observation. So, in this sense, science and philosophy are distinct disciplines, with different approaches to understanding reality. (2) Historically speaking, scientists have not paid much attention to the philosophy of science. There are exceptions - for instance, Thomas Kuhn was a physicist by training, but became famous as a philosopher - but, generally speaking, science has operated independently of the philosophy of science. One of the things that philosophy of science in the late twentieth century discovered was that there is no single \u201cscientific method\u201d that applies to all sciences. Methods that are very important in certain areas of science don\u2019t apply at all to others. For a long time, the philosophy of science tried to devise a set of rules that would make something qualify as \u201cscientific\u201d (or disqualify something as \u201cunscientific\u201d) but it is generally thought now that this has been a failure. All of the standard criteria that have been proposed (falsifiability, replicability, and so on) have been found to be inadequate or insufficient. None of this means that the philosophy of science isn\u2019t useful - merely that it cannot be used as a guide by which scientists can make discoveries. It may well be a very good idea to teach philosophy of science in science classrooms, but the above two points might make it harder to justify. ",

            "answer_text": "Because scientists are, generally speaking, just not qualified to teach philosophy of science. They don\u2019t think about their work at this level, and are often discouraged from doing so. People who question science too much, or who look too deeply into it, are likely to be seen as annoyances, instead of being welcomed into the discussion. They\u2019re branded as being too, \u201cphilosophical\u201d. Furthermore, from what I can tell, most scientists\u2019 understanding of the philosophy of science is limited to mostly Karl Popper, whose philosophy of science is extremely outdated in contemporary work. And you have to additionally realize that teaching philosophy is a very different game from teaching science. When you\u2019re teaching a philosophy class, you have to give time to opposing positions, ones which might seem undermining to the practice of science. When you\u2019re teaching a science class, you\u2019re very likely to avoid those topics. As an eternal advocate for philosophy, I would suggest that all scientists should be required to take philosophy of science classes though, especially at the graduate level. However, scientists wouldn\u2019t be very happy about that. I\u2019m even told from some of my fellow science graduate students, that they\u2019re encouraged to take as few courses as possible so that they can spend more time in the lab. ",
