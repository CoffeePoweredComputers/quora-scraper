            "answer_text": "In order to slow the spread of Covid-19, the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised that all people wear non-medical face masks. If you\u2019re asymptomatically sick, wearing a mask will shield you and stop you from transmitting noxious droplets. Wearing a travel mask, on the other hand, does not allow you from the routine of sanitizing and washing your hands, do not go outside till it\u2019s important, and maintaining a proper social distance from others in public. Which Face Masks Provide The Best Protection? The best mask, as well as an awesome face mask, should cover your nose and mouth fully, use at least two layers of material and be washable without risk. After more research on mask effectiveness is conducted out, we\u2019ve also changed our suggestions. Although a recently popularised study by Duke seems to show that neck gaiters are worse than other masks. It could work fine if your neck gaiter suits you well and covers your nose and mouth! But there are more suitable and useful alternatives available in the market. What Types Of Masks Are Most Effective For COVID-19?Find below basic type of mask which is easily available in market 1. Fabric/Cloth Face Masks When the individual wearing the mask sneezes, coughs or speaks, fabric or cloth masks contain droplets that are released. They decrease virus spread, are easy to buy or make, and it can be washed and used again. It is also necessary for the individual to completely avoid their face masks and to sanitise or wash their hands after it if they do. In addition, if a mask made of cloth or fabric gets wet or dirty, then it is necessary to change that mask. These masks are for individual use only and should not be shared with anyone. 2. Surgical Face Masks Surgical masks are loose-fitting and disposable, also named as clinical or medical masks. The nose and mouth are prevented from coming into contact with particles which may contain germs. They are made to prevent you from sprays or splashes that could get into your mouth or nose. These masks can also block out large particles in the air and can ensure that the user\u2019s droplets do not spread. These masks are for only single use. 3. N95 Face Masks As they can filter out both small and large particles as the individual breathes, N95 masks have a better layer of safety than a surgical mask or fabric mask. They\u2019re called N95 masks as 95% of the particles or substances that could come into contact with your face are designed to stop them. These masks are not for general public use, however, and should be used for healthcare staff as well as first responders in the health industry. They\u2019re also uncomfortable with people with facial hair or kids. For these masks, healthcare professionals are suitably checked, and they are meant to be single-use only like surgical masks, while experts are testing successful ways to clean these masks. 4. Awesome Face Masks With Valves These masks could make it much easier to breathe out, but as the individual does so they also exhale their bacteria into the atmosphere around them. The use of masks with valves has been restricted by more and more medical facilities nationwide. They do a decent job of protecting the user, but they don\u2019t give much protection to the people around the person wearing a mask because of one-way valves. They don\u2019t give the individuals around the wearer much security. If the wearer is infectious, they may still be spreading the infection to those around them, either consciously or unconsciously. Since protecting others is the main reason for wearing a mask, a simpler mask with a filter might be a better option. ",

            "answer_text": "A face mask does not have the absolute(complete, guaranteed, certain) ability to prevent infection. Someone can still cough or sneeze on your eyes or nose. You can still touch your eyes, nose or face, later put your fingers in your mouth or nose later etc. Viruses can still affect you. However\u2026.a mask MIGHT make some people more aware of how many times they touch their hands to their face, eyes, nose, mouth, in a minute\u2026and that might help some. It might help us to temporarily alter our habits. Being aware of touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth by putting your hands up and realizing you\u2019re touching that mask for the fortieth time in one minute, might make you aware. Most of us touch our nose, eyes, face or mouth very frequently, so a mask might remind you not to do it. The trouble is that nurses and doctors are more in need of the masks, because they are meeting people who are sick - if not with C-19, with something - and they need very much to not catch anything during this time. That\u2019s a really important issue. I realize some politicians might knee-jerk insist no one who is well wear a mask because they don\u2019t want people panicking or photos going around of huge numbers of people wearing masks, which makes it look like they\u2019re not in control of the situation. That\u2019s their problem. The fact is that right now, it isn\u2019t about them. It\u2019s about us. All of us. Controlling the situation is not about making self-aggrandizing speeches right now, it\u2019s about the behavior of every single person in every country. You don\u2019t feel you need to alter your habits because you\u2019re young and invulnerable? Wake up and smell the coffee - not only can you spread it to a loved one who is elderly or immuno-compromised, it\u2019s also true that young people are also dying of C-19. It\u2019s not just old people. Some young people survive the infection but wind up with severe lung damage. They won\u2019t be going bungee jumping or parasailing any time soon. Wake up, young people, you are not immune. The chief way we can protect ourselves is by staying away from people who show obvious symptoms, and by washing our hands frequently, and by staying home if we do get sick. Obviously, if we get a common cold or influenza virus, that is absolutely not a good time to be wandering around contacting people. It\u2019s a good time to stay home. We would not want to get exposed to C-19 while being sick with something else. We also don\u2019t want to risk causing someone else to get C-19 with another infection. Wiping down surfaces with disinfectant, while being sure to not mishandle those wipes (throw them away, do not reuse) also helps. If you diligently do those things you greatly reduce the chances of getting C-19 or influenza, and perhaps even other common viral infections as well. ",

            "answer_text": " Image source: physical distancing is effective for covid-19 coronavirus prevention Yes, wearing of masks reduces transmission of the Covid-19 coronavirus by 82.2%. Here are other distancing measures and how much they interrupt transmission of the virus. Physical Distancing is Effective for Covid-19 Coronavirus Prevention New studies showed that physical distancing is effective for Covid-19 coronavirus prevention. Specifically, a study from the Lancet medical journal dated June 1, 2020 analyzed 172 observational studies around the globe. This involved 25,697 patients. The researchers found the following data. Findings regarding distancing Chance of transmission at 1 meter (3.3 feet): 12.8% Chance of transmission at 2 meters (6.6 feet): 2.6% The evidence on distancing was \u201cmoderate\u201d. Face masks Chance of transmission without a face mask: 17.4% Chance of transmission when face mask is worn: 3.1% This translates into a reduction of 82.2% when 17.4% (transmission without face mask) is set at a baseline of 100%. The evidence regarding face masks was \u201clow\u201d. Eye protection Chance of transmission without eye protection: 16% Chance of transmission with eye protection: 5.5% This eye protection could be wearing of glasses, face shield, visor or goggles. The evidence for eye protection was \u201clow\u201d. Handwashing also important Although not formally measured in this report, hand washing is also important to stop transmission of the virus. Another study looking at the effects of social distancing In addition, there was a publication from the Canadian Medical Association Journal regarding the transmission of the Covid-19 coronavirus. These researchers conducted a prospective study including 375,609 cases in 144 geopolitical areas worldwide. They looked at an association between Covid-19 coronavirus cases and various measures to control its growth. Here are the results: Restriction of mass gatherings: 35% reduction of infection rate School closures: 37% reduction of infection rate Social distancing (2 meters of 6.6 ft): 38% reduction of infection rate Conclusion There is presently no cure for Covid-19 coronavirus. But there are ways to interrupt transmission of the virus from infected persons to non-infected persons. These methods are generally known as social distancing. One study found that a distance of 2 meters (6.6 feet) reduces transmission to 2.6% from 12.8% at 1 meter (3.3 feet). Another study found that the infection rate was reduced to 38% at 2 meters (6.6 feet) distance. Wearing of a face mask reduces the risk of transmission from 17.4% (no face mask) to 3.1%. Eye protection reduces the risk of transmission from 16% (no eye protection) to 5.5%. Restriction of mass gatherings reduce the infection rate by 35%, school closures by 37%. Synergistic effect when several restrictive measures in place When all these measures are taken together, there is a synergistic effect that protects us even more from the transmission of the virus than the sum of each effect. This is the reason why some countries control the infection rate from Covid-19 really well, but others that were laxer in their restrictions suffer higher infection rates. As long as there is no effective treatment or vaccination available, it is important to use all the available prevention methods to stop the spread of the virus. Effective vaccinations will likely only be available in April or May 2021. Previously published here: physical distancing is effective for covid-19 coronavirus prevention ",

            "answer_text": "You have to remember that no mask is 100% effective. Cumulative statistics is a good mathematical tool here to illustrate how little they protect in the long run. A N95 Mask with perfect seal, no touching or adjusting, thrown away after use, should be more than 90% effective. A cloth square with no seal, constantly adjusting it, pulling it up/down to drink and eat - maybe 75% effective, or less? Whether a virus has a 10% or 25% chance of transmission, it will eventually get through. Say that 75% chance per day of stopping transmission with a cloth mask is extrapolated over a whole week = 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 x 0.75 = 0.13 = only 13% cumulative effectiveness if out in COVID exposed area every day that week, so a 77% chance of getting exposed. With a super-careful person, N95 mask = 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.47 = 47% effectiveness over the same week, so still a 53% chance of getting exposed. That\u2019s not so good. Yes, masks reduce transmission, but not by as much as you would think, and you should be aware of the real probabilities of transmission, especially how that probability increases over prolonged exposure. Masks are not a magic shield that will save you from a virus, which is probably why CDC workers wear sealed, positive-pressure lvl 4 biohazard suits when working with deadly viruses (including COVID-19), and not a cloth mask. they need that 99.999% protection day in, day out. Yet these same people are telling everyone that cloth masks will protect us, and mandating their use? Do your own math - armed with the tools of cumulative statistics and make your own choices and ask questions of your policy makers. And\u2026 if you want to criticize, shame, charge or imprison people not wearing masks, go easy on them because you are probably, at best - only half right. ",

            "answer_text": "Protection is not a yes/no situation. If the mask is worn properly, it will contain the larger and medium sized droplets you emit by speaking, coughing and sneezing. Those droplets are a vehicle for the virus if you are contaminated. Ot also keeps those droplets coming from others, out of your mouth and nose. Even better if you would wear glasses, since the virus can infect you through the eyes. But aerosols? Yes, quite right. Those are the tiny droplets that won\u2019t be stopped by a regular, non-medical mask. They \u201chang around you\u201d, a bit like a cloud. And they can carry virus. But, due to size, much less virus. A mask will stop some of the aerosols, not all. But since Covid seems to be dose-dependent (the more virus particles you start with, the more serious the outcome seems to be), it makes sense to protect yourself and others. Even if it\u2019s not 100% Staying well apart from eachother is the same thing. 1 meter apart is better than close together, 2 meters apart is even better, 6 meters apart \u00e9ven better. In terms of infection risk. But there are also other risks, like the need to socialize, loneliness and the economic destruction 6 meter social distancing would cause. So governments try out outweigh infection risks with normal human life. Trying to get as close to normal as they can without increasing the infection rate (R0) above 1. If you look at government measures from that perspective they start to make sense. Everything is a balans between \u201cnormal life as much as possible\u201d and \u201creducing infection rates so ICU\u2019s can manage\u201d. Why are elementary schools less problematic than universities, for example. Well, when cases are low enough, you can contain an outbreak locally. Elementary schools are much more local than universities. So yes, medical grade masks would be amazing. But supplies are low and needed for healthcare professionals. But regular masks reduce risk, even if they don\u2019t protect completely. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Do masks protect us from COVID-19? A. Yes, they most certainly do. Properly constructed masks are very effective in preventing the wearer from transmitting viral-laden droplets to others nearby when in public, especially when conditions don't favor social distancing. \ud83d\ude37 The evidence is clear that masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and that the more people who are wearing masks, the better. The favorability of wearing masks outside of Asia is increasing since rising disease prevalence and a clearer understanding that of both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission are possible \u2013 even common. Studies have found that viral load peaks in the days before symptoms begin and that speaking is enough to expel virus-carrying droplets [1]. The biggest thing with COVID now that shapes all of this guidance on masks is that we can\u2019t tell who\u2019s infected. You can\u2019t look in a crowd and say, \u201cOh, that person should wear a mask.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of asymptomatic infection, so everybody has to wear a mask. \ud83e\udd27\ud83d\ude37 There are several strands of evidence supporting the efficacy of masks [2, 3, 6]. But the strongest evidence in favor of masks come from studies of real-world scenarios. A recent study published in Health Affairs (June 16, 2020), for example, compared the COVID-19 growth rate before and after mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia. It found that mask mandates led to a slowdown in daily COVID-19 growth rate, which became more apparent over time [4]. Another study looked at coronavirus deaths across 198 countries and found that those with cultural norms or government policies favoring mask-wearing had lower death rates[5].  \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\u25cf [1] Can people spread the coronavirus if they don't have symptoms? 5 questions answered about asymptomatic COVID-19 [2] Visualizing Speech-Generated Oral Fluid Droplets with Laser Light Scattering | NEJM [3] Respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath and efficacy of face masks [4] Community Use Of Face Masks And COVID-19: Evidence From A Natural Experiment Of State Mandates In The US [5] (PDF) Association of country-wide coronavirus mortality with demographics, testing, lockdowns, and public wearing of masks (Update June 15, 2020).

No mask is 100% sealed, virons can \u2018sneak\u2019 through the leaks. If your mask \u2018fogs\u2019 your glasses, for instance, that\u2019s a big leak right there. The main source of the virus is the breath of infected people - mostly asymptomatic - and masks are intended to block as many of those virons as practical at the source. You\u2019re being told to wear a mask because you may be infected and not even know it. Masks serve a secondary purpose in that they help reduce the chance of you inhaling virons, but social distancing does much more to substantially reduce transmission. Coronavirus transmits in microscopic droplets of exhaled moisture, and while those droplets are too small to see, they are heavy enough that they settle out of the air in a few seconds. So, masks reduce the potential of spreading a VERY CONTAGIOUS disease their wearers may not even know they have. Social distancing reduces it further. And may help reduce the wearer\u2019s chance of catching any germs that made it past others\u2019 masks and distancing. But masks are not 100% effective, and don\u2019t forget about washing your hands. When those virons settle out of the air, they land on surfaces you may be touching. Or your clothes. Or tables. Papers. etc. And anything anyone else has been handling. Masks reduce transmission, but they don\u2019t prevent it. ",

If you\u2019re sick and need to be around others, properly wearing a mask can protect those around you from contracting your illness.

However, my colleagues at work recommended a health care website called MR.NEEDS They have N95 Respirators in stock - ISO certified & they ship from the USA.

Actually the mask acts as a filter which have some pores that will not allow the microbes present in the air to enter into our body through nasal system.. But it is not 100% efficient because some organisms are too small and pass through the pores.. So according to microbiology book of mbbs it says about surgical mask that we are wearing for covid 19.  But as some are using different kind of mask called N95, these mask are kind of HEPA and are very much effective.. But as they have a high price not all the people can afford to it. So using surgical mask can't protect you totally from covid19. It is a preventive method. Other methods like washing hand, not going outside, avoiding crowded place should also be done along with using a mask.  A picture from microbiology book about corona virus. ",

It is pretty disingenuous to suggest people are advocating masks as some kind of magic since NO ONE is saying a single action will protect you. The style of mask you wear determines if you are protected from breathing in, or protecting others from your own breath. The ones that protect you from breathing in toxins are cumbersome and relatively uncomfortable as compared to the typical style that protects other people from you. These cloth masks are the type seen on medical staff for over 100 years as part of a safe operating theater. If they are using them, there is a reason.

            "answer_text": "I believe you should. Doctors\u2019 offices have been asking people with flu symptoms to put on a surgical mask for several years now, the intent being to keep doctors and staff members from catching the flu from their patients. The recognized standard for protecting the doctors is the N95 mask. If you wore such a mask so that it sealed properly all the way around, then you would not get COVID-19 unless you got it on your hands and then touched eye, nose, or mouth. Surgical masks are less effective that N95 masks, but they still prevent almost as many people in hospitals or doctors\u2019 offices from getting the flu. Cloth masks are less effective and among them some are almost as good or a little better than surgical masks, but others are almost totally worthless. But whether you suffer from COVID-19 and how badly it affects you if you do get it depends on \u201cviral load,\u201d i.e., the total number of viral particles that you get hit with when somebody sneezes or coughs on you. If you only got one variod up your nose, my guess is that your immune system would be able to kill that variod and its copies before they started to really mess up your system. If you got a gazillion of them all at one time, they would be making you sick and your body would have to play catch-up, and maybe you\u2019d die before your immune system conquered the disease. Any mask for self-protection is better than none, but it is to your advantage to get the best mask available to you. At one point, am MD in Taiwan was making his own masks because manufacturing hadn\u2019t caught up with the new high demand, and he wanted to protect himself to the extent possible. So even doctors will use cloth masks if they can\u2019t get anything better. Now KN95 masks (from China I guess) are being sold on the Internet. The KN95 standard is not significantly different from N95 masks. Hospitals are trying to stick to N95s, so buying this other kind of mask would appear not to threaten health care workers. ",

If we don\u2019t wear masks, any person standing with us coughs or sneezes and is already infected, his/her droplets will be around that place and will directly without any barrier gets in touch with you through your mouth or nose. Masks is a barrier to that droplet. Health experts say the evidence is clear that masks can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and that the more people wearing masks, the better. Studies have found that viral load peaks in the days before symptoms begin and that speaking is enough to expel virus-carrying droplets. A recent study published in Health Affairs, for example, compared the COVID-19 growth rate before and after mask mandates in 15 states and the District of Columbia. It found that mask mandates led to a slowdown in daily COVID-19 growth rate, which became more apparent over time. The first five days after a mandate, the daily growth rate slowed by 0.9 percentage-points compared to the five days prior to the mandate; at three weeks, the daily growth rate had slowed by 2 percentage-points.

If you are a trained medical professional who knows how to use it, and how to behave while wearing it, then a face mask is an important piece of personal protection.If you are an average citizen who puts on a face mask and then goes about your normal activities, then studies have shown clearly that the have no effect your chances of catching a disease. They don\u2019t provide protection under these circumstances and you\u2019re basically wasting an important resource that the professionals need right now. (edit: see below)If you already have the virus, it\u2019s an effective way of reducing the chances that you transmit the virus to others. It\u2019s protective for them.Addendum: There\u2019s strong new evidence which weakens the argument of the second point. The reason is that we\u2019ve all become much better informed about how to properly wear face masks. It\u2019s now pretty clear that many of us \u201cuntrained\u201d folks are perfectly capable of properly wearing a mask. Alas, we can also all think of examples of people we see at the supermarket who haven\u2019t read the memo. ",

If someone is infected he is spreading the virus by exhaling in breathing, speaking, singing, loughing and coughing BUT \u2026 These virus do not travel naked but comfortable in a wet vehicel as drops, droplets, aerosol and these are much larger and many of them stick in the fiberweb of the mask, of any mask. Of cause some masks filter better, but they work all. Masks with a valve to exhale don\u2019t do it, the give free way to travel into the world. These prevention masks work if we all wear them, we reduce spreading and contaminating others. ln a smaller amount they can reduce inhalative load too.. ",

            "answer_text": "We've gathered all the possible inquiries you may have regarding this matter. Here are the answers to some of your questions about face masks. When do I need to wear a face mask? According to the Department of Health in the Philippines, there's no need to wear a face mask in public if you're not showing any symptoms of flu (cough, colds, or respiratory symptoms). You only need to wear face masks if: You have a cough, colds, respiratory symptoms, or difficulty in breathingYou're taking care of someone who has cough, colds, or respiratory symptomsYou're a health worker and taking care of a patient showing cough, colds, or respiratory symptomsWhat should I keep in mind when I'm wearing a face mask? Dr. Edsel Salvana (NIH\u2019s Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology Director) said that if you're wearing a surgical face mask, make sure you're covering your nose and mouth. The blue or colored side should be facing out. Also, it's best not to touch the outside part of it. In case you touched it, just wash your hands properly with soap and water. What kind of face mask should I wear? While an N95 respirator mask is far more effective in protecting you from airborne infections, disposable face masks are already enough to block big particles from reaching your mouth. Moreover, Dr. Salvana added that people should also stop hoarding N95 masks since the masks are prioritized to be used by health workers handling tuberculosis patients. Are cloth face masks effective? Unfortunately, cloth face masks are not recommended to use since they do not have filters like surgical masks or respirator masks do, according to Dr. Edsel Salvana.

The surgical mask is designed to protect the patient from the surgeon by filtering out the surgeon spittle, which in this case could contain the virus. Medical staff treating potentially infected patients use a mask that is sealed around the edges and has a rating of N95 as it is sealed more of the air breathed in and out pass through the filter, and a greater area of the face is covered, so reducing the chance of infection being passed into the system from infected hands. there are other open sided masks which may have been used for painting which may be as effective or less effective than the surgical masks. The full hazmat suit offers complete protection but has significant issues for the common man in the street. So wearing a mask cannot prevent COVID -19 infection it can help restrict the spread of the disease the type of mask you use depends on what your objectives are. ",

I will say this though, now that there is a shortage of the respirator masks for health care workers in the States, the federal government is telling medical personnel to use the accordion type of surgical masks which do not fit snugly on the face, and the medical profession, nurses and doctors, understandably are extremely upset by this because it dramatically heightens their risk of contracting and spreading the virus.

If you don\u2019t wear mask in a city where it is mandated and most wear one, you will by many be considered as an egoist deliberately destroying for others.

N95 masks, N100 masks, surgical masks, etc., do not filter particles and viruses less than 0.3 microns in diameter. This corona virus is very small at 0.125 microns in diameter. Healthcare people have been getting sick and are still getting sick\u2026and they wear masks all the time at work. Masks are usually only worn to protect others from the contents of the wearer\u2019s nose & mouth. Wearing a mask has become necessary since many essential businesses are requiring masks to be worn..but no one really knows how, why or when to wear a mask. The CDC did not change its guidelines regarding mask wearing, but has told the general public that wearing a mask may protect others if the mask wearer is sick or carrying the virus unknowingly. The CDC did not say wearing a mask will protect the wearer from becoming infected. ",

By reducing that probability, you lessen the chances of getting COVID-19. It\u2019s all a statistical roll of the dice. If no one wears masks, there\u2019s almost a 100% probability that everyone will be exposed to the virus. Some will get it and die. Some will just be hospitalized. Some will just be asymptomatic. And some will not get it at all. If everyone wears a mask, there\u2019s a much lower chance of coming in contact with the virus. A lower risk of contact means a lower risk of contagion. Which means fewer sick and dead people. So masks may not prevent (eliminate entirely) COVID-19, but they sure help reduce the risk. ",

But experts not involved in the study who were contacted by Live Science were hesitant to put much stock into the findings.

The odds are once someone knows they are sick they will stay home until well, that reduces your exposure potential some. Keeping 6\u2032 away from non-family members reduces it more. Washing hands frequently reduces it more. Not touching your face reduces it more. The mask is the last line of defense filtering out the majority of airborne particles ejected when people talk, cough or sneeze inside your 6\u2032 bubble. Unvalved masks also benefit those around you in that they filter out most of what you exhale. ",

Apart from wearing masks, you should maintain distance of 1 metre and use hand sanitizer or wash your hands after every half an hour. By following these ways, you can prevent contracting coronavirus.  Since, Corona virus is type of virus that spread when any infected person sneezes or cough & small particles that comes out of them, spread into air. So, if anyone come into contact with these particle, he/she may get infected. This is the reason that it is advised to people to wear masks while moving out or meeting with public. You can use 3 Ply Surgical Face Masks and N95 Face masks for this purpose. ",

For whatever purpose . protect yourself with that mask and others too . Feel safer . Always maintain a distance of six feet . And move out only for special reasons . so . Stay at home . Wash your hands often . Keep social distancing at all times . Keep yourself safe . Take all preventive steps . There\u2019s no cure . No medicine . Only isolation and quarantine. thanks for asking .

Another contributor from Israel offered that they use gas masks, no problem. The scuba apparatus has all inhaled air from the tank, and exhale goes into the room. Both properly cover the eyes. The N95 mask suffers from the inconvenient fact that he rating is for particles greater than 0.3 microns and the virus is 0.13 microns or smaller. Experts explain this away by pointing out that most water aerosol is greater than 0.5 microns. The rub may be that the virus may be dry and suspended in the air like dry pollen 10-100 times its size. Both gas masks and scuba masks can be washed for multiple use, unlike the N-95. The battery power respirator venting in the back still use filters with a similar pore size unless they are made to filter out organic gas, like the gas mask. The surgical mask was made to stop splash or squirted blood from getting on the surgeon\u2019s face, and are best used by a patient who is coughing or sneezing. ",

So the masks that fit tightly on your face is the only reliable prevention of the infection with covid. That includes the kind that workers use when working with sprays and chemicals. Paper masks with space on the side are pretty much useless , but if you are many feet away and even two drops in the air are stopped from reaching your mouth and nose it may help, but for any extended exposure or close contact forget it.

Ya wearing masks may protect from Covid-19, the major way of getting the virus into the body is by face(mouth, nose,etc..) , so basically you're protected 90%. But virus also spread by hands and many other things also. So using mask alone cannot protect you from Covid-19. And it depends upon the material used in mask, like N-95 it's considered to be the safest, but it's used by surgeons while they do surgeries. So basically mask material matters and also you need to wash hands and as soon as you come from outdoors you need to take bath immediately. This may work 95%, the rest 5% may come from the things which you touch,like if you buy second hand mobile, it may sometimes contain virus, or when you buy vegetables, that may also contain, so in this situation you need to clean the things that you buy. Hopes this would be helpful! Thanks! ",

My surgical style mask is longer than the traditional ones so it fits against the face without gaps. There are lots of non-woven fabrics at you nearby superstore, and many places still have replaceable filters just for masks. Just add a pocket to your mask, remove the filter before washing. Experts are recommending cotton fabric like sheet or pillowcase material (they can have a very high, dense thread count).I have a tutorial on space \u201cA Million Mask Challenge\u201d, here on Quora. That style is full coverage, and you can use ties or elastics to secure it. They fit very well and size adjusted up or down as desired.I also have a pictorial step by step of a surgical style mask. Begin with 2 layers of fabric 9in by 7.5 in, place a sheet of non-woven fabric between the layers. Fold as shown, add trim and ties.I cut and press the mask parts first, I have 15 waiting for trim and straps or elastics right now. I like to do it this way because cutting and pressing takes the most time. Now I take them to the machine and I can do 4 per hour. ",

The best fabrics seem to be T-shirt fabric or bed sheets (for a mix of filtering and breathability). These are also washable with soap and water. Using a home-made mask is not optimal, but it helps preserve the supply of medical masks for medical staff and first responders (and some of them are now using home-made masks due to the shortage) and seems to be about 50% effective compared to an N95 mask (whatever that means). I am including the link only for the simplest rectangular mask, (which is the limit of my sewing ability). https://courierpressblogs.com/pdf/howtomakeafacemask.pdf However, I imagine the fabrics should be the same for each.

Plus, most people wear them thinking it's to protect themselves rather than to protect others. Finally, I seriously doubt our elected officials are following the prescribed behaviors; so I think that's suspicious as well. Overall, I think the mask wearing says a lot about people, especially with the irony of people thinking the mask is supposed to protect them from others rather than the other way around.
