            "answer_text": "In mid 19th century, when the world was almost explored by various adventurers, England, Spain, Norway etc. spend money on making the sailors and researchers go on remote islands filled with medicines in the form of trees and plants of the jungle. Idea was to procure this medicine and poison to make a fortune. One of the ship sent was the Scientist and Admiral Robert Fitzroy.  Though a good scientist himself, Robert (Left) was no good at Geology, Biology, Zoology etc. So he hired an all time failure guy named Charles Darwin(Right) on a 5 year long journey. A usual failure Darwin, who finally decided to be a Father at the Church decided to accept the offer. A journey started in 1831, Darwin along with Fitzroy and his crew, landed on an island Galapagos, east of South America.  As a student of Christianity, Darwin knew that, God created world around 4000BC and the process lasted a week. During that week, all the animals came on the Earth, elephants, giraffes, rats, monkeys, whales, even humans.  But what Darwin saw on Galapagos was different. He saw that on the Northern Island of Galapagos, the type of Turtles had Semi Hemispherical Shells (Left Image) while the Southern Turtles had the shell but the shell near the neck was curved upwards (Right Image). Darwin deduced that the southern turtles ate cactus which was on more height than usual. So on thousand of years of evolution, their neck got longer and shell became curved to ease the process. Then he noted various examples of the same on Galapagos Island. That was the basis of Evolution Theory.

            "answer_text": "Primarily through his observations while serving as science officer aboard the HMS Beagle. His most famous stop was in the Galapagos Islands where he noted the differences in differences between the giant tortoises and finches from island to island. Each seeming suited to the lifestyle of that island. It didn\u2019t make much sense for these animals to have very subtle differences and was too convenient that they all were ideally suited to their particular island or niche. Interesting footnote: The captain of the Beagle was named Robert FitzRoy. He wanted a science officer on board because he wanted someone intelligent to converse with (he didn\u2019t think much of the sailors\u2019 wit). He was primarily worried about going insane without intellectual stimulation because insanity and suicide ran in his family and he was terrified of it. However FitzRoy was an intensely religious man and he and Darwin would get eventually get into heated arguments over progressive issues (like abolition) and the friendship didn\u2019t last. Later in life when FitzRoy realized that Darwin had developed the groundwork for his theory while on his ship, and that he had a hand in it by allowing Darwin to have some influence on where they stopped, he ironically went insane. He eventually committed suicide. ",
