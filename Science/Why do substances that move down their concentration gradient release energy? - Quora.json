            "answer_text": "Why do substances that move down their concentration gradient release energy? Assuming that you are referring to the dissolution of a solute and its diffusion into a solvent\u2026 As any substance diffuses from high to low concentration, the substance itself becomes more \u201cspread out\u201d or \u201cmore disordered\u201d. In Thermodynamic terms this is saying that the \u201cEntropy, S, increases\u201d of the system. The simple relationship between the amount of internal The internal energy of this system, therefore increases but the energy must come from somewhere. That somewhere is the \u201csurroundings\u201d. Therefore, energy, Q, is transferred FROM surroundings TO the system. The relationship between energy and entropy, S, is related to the absolute temperature. T by the relationship\u2026 \u0394Q = \u0394S / T If T remains constant, then an increase in S means that the change in internal energy also increases and this is the amount of energy lost by the surroundings to the system. Simple diffusion is, therefore, an endothermic process driven by entropy. When a substance DISSOLVES and diffuses down a concentration gradient, the energy change is complicated by the solvation of a solute by the solvent. Frequently, the interaction between solute and solvent is strong and energy is released in this process (largely from the loss of Kinetic Energy of solvent molecules as they are held to the solute particles). This results in a LOSS of energy FROM the system TO the surroundings which is typically (but not always) an exothermic process. This exothermic change from the solvent usually masks the endothermic change from diffusion of the solute. Needless to say, the whole process can become quite complicated when the specific substances and the specific nature of their interactions are taken into account (such as increase in entropy of the solute couples with the decrease in entropy of the solvent molecules which attach to the solute as well as a rising value of T - which is why examples are usually kept very general since there is no simple \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d solution to this question.

            "answer_text": "This is rather like downward quantum jumps of electrons within atoms. As particles move down the concentration gradient, they are losing potential energy. Each level has less potential than the one above it. This is a consequence of the force that makes the particles move. This extra energy must be released in some form, eg internal energy, chemical potential energy, radiation and so on. ",
