            "answer_text": "A smartphone is a handheld personal computer. It possesses extensive computing capabilities, including high-speed access to the Internet using both Wi-Fi and mobile broadband. Most, if not all, smartphones are also built with support for Bluetooth and satellite navigation. Modern smartphones have a touchscreen color displaywith a graphical user interface that covers the front surface and enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type and press onscreen icons. Interaction is mostly done using touch, besides a few physical buttons. Smartphones are typically pocket-sized, with somewhat larger sizes being called phablets; they are generally smaller than tablet computers. Smartphones function using a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Smartphones use a mobile operating system and are able to process a variety of software components, known as \"apps\". Most basic apps (e.g. event calendar, camera, web browser) come pre-installed with the system, while others are available for download, either for free or charging money to one's balance, from official sources like the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. One may purchase apps by either adding and using valid credit card account information to the smartphone or by buying a gift card for exclusive use of the balance of the card on its specified app store. Apps, and the operating system itself, can receive bug fixes and gain additional functionality through updates. Today, smartphones largely fulfil their users' needs for a microphone (smartphones often have one to four microphones), a digital camera (most smartphones are made with one front-facing and one to three rear-facing integrated digital cameras), a communications device (smartphones can transmit online chat, e-mails, telephone callsand video chat through the Internet by Wi-Fi as well as mobile broadband; a smartphone uses its camera in video chat, as well as its microphone in video chat and telephone calls), a handheld audio recorder (using the microphone), a satellite navigation system and trip planner, weather forecasting, a media player, a clock, news, a calculator, a web browser, a video game player, a flashlight (smartphones may possess one to two LEDs for illumination and photographic flashneeds), a compass (smartphones that contain built-in magnetometers are able to function as a compass), an address book, a note creator, an event calendar, etc. Some apps allow sending and receiving facsimile (fax) over a smartphone, including raster facsimile data generated directly and digitally from document and image file formats. Internal storage of 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 or 512 gigabytes, or removable SD cardstorage, allows for digital storage of software and personal data (including digital photographs and videos). This is often augmented by cloud storage. Internally, many smartphones contain a vibrator, often used as a method of alerting of a notification or call, and as a way to evoke a more vibrant experience while playing video games. Typical smartphones will include one or more of the following sensors: magnetometer, proximity sensor, barometer, gyroscope and accelerometer. Since 2010, smartphones have adopted integrated virtual assistants, such as Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, BlackBerry Assistant and Samsung Bixby. Mobile payment is now a feature of most smartphones. Some smartphones have a fingerprint sensor, an iris scanner or face recognition technology as a form of biometric authentication. In 1999, the Japanese firm NTT DoCoMo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country. Smartphones sales started to grow rapidly by the late 2000s. In the third quarter of 2012, one billion smartphones were in use worldwide. Global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for feature phones in early 2013. ",

            "answer_text": "Smartphones have dramatically changed the way we live and work. With the advent of touch screens that actually gave users a responsive surface, smartphone interfaces become more intuitive. Furthermore, the introduction of geolocation technology provides an application with a way to locate the user on maps or social networking purposes. Long term memory gave these phones the ability to store pictures and other media. Finally, mobile device-specific operating systems brought all this technology together into a smartphone that can take pictures, browse the internet, and run applications. This collection of technology is what makes smartphones work. Touch screens are constructed of layers of conductive material. Smartphones use capacitive touch screens to make touch interaction comfortable. Smartphones also contain the ability to locate the user via GPS technology. Flash memory allows smartphones to save a large number of pictures, text messages and voice messages. The aspect of smartphones that tie all the hardware innovations together is an operating system made specifically for smartphone use. The operating systems are meant to run on small devices, using touch technology and functioning primarily with limited processing resources and smaller hard drive space. ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone has a smartphone, or so it seems. In fact, there were an estimated 1.4 billion smartphones in the world as of December 2013 [source: Koetsier]. People are constantly talking on them, taking pictures, surfing the Internet and doing dozens of other things, including shopping for cars. Captain Kirk would be jealous. At their core, smartphones, and all cell phones for that matter, are mini radios, sending and receiving radio signals. Cell phone networks are divided into specific areas called cells. Each cell has an antenna that receives cell phone signals. The antenna transmits signals just like a radio station, and your phone picks up those signals just as a radio does.  Smartphones use cell phone network technology to send and receive data (think phone calls, Web browsing, file transfers). Developers classify this technology into generations. Do you remember the first generation? It included analog cell phone technology. However, as cell phone technology progressed, the protocols became more advanced. In 2014, cell phones are in the world of the fourth generation, or 4G. Although most carriers are expanding their 4G technology, some companies, such as Samsung, are developing 5G technology, which if recent tests are any indication, will allow you to download an entire movie in less than a second. Here's a list of some of the additional capabilities smartphones have, from intuitive to perhaps less so:  Manage your personal info including notes, calendar and to-do listsCommunicate with laptop or desktop computersSync data with applications like Microsoft Outlook and Apple's iCal calendar programsHost applications such as word processing programs or video gamesScan a receiptCash a checkReplace your wallet. A smartphone can store credit card information and discount or membership card infoPay bills by downloading apps such as PayPal and CardStarAllow you to create a WiFi network that multiple devices can use simultaneously. That means you can access the Internet from your iPad or laptop without a router or another peripheral device.Don't mind if the language was not good! Thankyou! ",

Then the hardware of the phones numerous hardware involved like transceiver, camera sensors, design, durability etc. Phones work on frequency to make call or use data or FM radio those like a mini laptop. Then to control and make use of hardware in the phone it needs an operating system here few different options like AndroidiOSUbuntuWindowsSymbianBelleTizen(Samsung OS)Application support developers of different platforms develop applications for operating systems. Applications like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, calendar,clock, etc. This is why smartphones are PDA s they reduce our burden of using a laptop or desktop for every use.

            "answer_text": "From the software perspective: Smartphones have two operating systems. The one you see is most commonly based on a general-purpose operating system - a Unix for iOS, and Linux for Android. This runs on a system that is more or less a regular computer. The one you don't see is the baseband OS running on the baseband processor. This is a separate system running a specialised, real-time OS. An RTOS is needed to handle the radio. The two systems communicate through a few well-defined interfaces. The programming Software Development Kits  given to the developers is only for the general-purpose OS. ",
