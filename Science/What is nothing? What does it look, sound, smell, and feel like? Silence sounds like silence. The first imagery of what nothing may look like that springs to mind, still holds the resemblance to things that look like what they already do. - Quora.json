            "answer_text": "In human terms I think that nothingness is a state of total blankness, no sensory input whatever, no sight, no sound, no mental processes, a human body with absolutely nothing going on at all. I suspect a state not possible to achieve in this realm because even in the deepest state of meditation basic human functions continue, breathing, circulation, digestion etc. Death may be the only thing that brings the human body into a state near to nothingness, all of the normal bodily and mental functions are halted. The physical body still exists, for a time, so nothingness is not total, yet. When the human remains have reverted to their original chemical state it may be said that nothingness has been achieved, maybe. The physical body may have gone completely but consider the spiritual realm, if, as many believe, the spirit, or soul, whatever you call it passes on to another level of consciousness, the afterlife, has a state of nothingness been achieved, I believe that it has not as the spiritual being may well continue to experience things. Who knows, certainly not I. A very interesting and thought provoking question, but one, I suspect, that will not be fully answered on this side of the veil. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing is life without love, art without heart, Music without passion. I dont think its possible to imagine nothing, because as soon as you think of anything you\u2019re imagining something. Although there are those who can reach deep states of meditation where they can separate their mind from the physical state and become empty of all thoughts, but since their are no mental processes occurring, It\u2019s difficult to see how you would ever be able to be aware of this or remember it. So \u2018nothing\u2019 would be a state of non-existence which would be impossible to be aware of. The best we can do is to approximate it to the absence of something that we can qualify/quantify\u2026I think ",
