            "answer_text": "The sugar (glucose, carbohydrates - other words often used) produced by photosynthesis is, first of all, used by the plant as its fuel for growing, making flowers, fruit, and seed, making new roots. What isn\u2019t used right away is stored, sometimes in the leaves, or stems, often in the roots - that\u2019s where potatoes and carrots come from. Then these plants, laden with the sugar they are producing, become the food for all the animals. ",

The basic ideas include: The glucose being respired to produce energy (ATP) for living functionsThe glucose being polymerised into starch molecules for efficient storageThe glucose being polymerised into cellulose, to help cell wall developmentThe glucose being converted to fats (energy storage)The glucose being converted to amino acids",
