            "answer_text": "Planets are made by the aggregation of dust that forms from the creation of elements heavier that helium in novae or supernovae. The most common such solids are silica and silicates, iron, iron oxide and oxides of other elements, such as magnesium, calcium and aluminium. Upon melting, which requires temperatures > 1000 degrees C, various oxides react with silica, thus SiO2 + MgO -> MgSiO3 (enstatite, one end of the pyroxene series in which the Mg can be replaced by other divalent metal oxides) If we add another such oxide we get something like (Mg,Fe)SiO4 (the olivine series. The fact that the various metal oxides and silica can form various ratios that crystallize differently is why we have such a variety of rocks. Metal oxides can also form crystals, thus we can get a family of spinels from A2O3 + BO -> A2BO4. Here we can even have A = B, thus Fe3O4 (magnetite)is in the spinel family. There r4eally is a huge variety of rocks possible, simply because various oxides can crystallise together as one entity. ",

            "answer_text": "The wording of the question implies that \u201crocks\u201d must have been raw material. But, what was the original raw material was dust. Rock is made in the interior of planets under the tremendous heat of the accretion process and the tremendous pressure from the planet\u2019s gravity. The chemistry that makes rock happens as Ian Miller outlines. Then, with later collisions of planetoids or planetary bodies, some shattering of growing planets occurs so that we do end up with actual rock orbiting the Sun. From that, the final planet sweeps up the rock and dust in its orbit. ",
