            "answer_text": "The picture that seems to emerge from quantum mechanics is one where small particles may literally not have a state, not even a position, until they\u2019re forced to by some sort of experiment. If they do have a definite position, we are fundamentally unable to say what it is, and we\u2019re forced to invent quite bizarre mathematical theories to explain how they really do have a position when they appear not to. If that is the case, are they real? You could ask whether gravity is real. Gravity, as a force that acts between objects having mass, was literally an invention by Isaac Newton. Now his interpretation of the facts has been superseded scientifically by relativity, in which gravity is warped spacetime. Prior to Newton, no-one used the word \u201cgravity\u201d to refer to the tendency of objects to move \u201cdownwards\u201d. But now it\u2019s part of everyday speech. Since the effects of gravity are real, we tend to say that gravity is real, regardless of whether our interpretation of it is right. The situation is a bit more murky than that with quantum mechanics, because large objects seem to be made up of small objects. And yet large objects appear to have a definite state and a definite position. So something is badly missing from our understanding. Some draw the conclusion that perhaps the entire physical universe exists in our minds; it\u2019s real in the sense that we can\u2019t just walk through walls and it\u2019s not just a dream, but it\u2019s unreal in the sense that it might not exist if we didn\u2019t exist. This would be scientifically a very radical conclusion to draw, and we don\u2019t have any scientific theory of how exactly that would work in detail. If someone were able to concoct one, we could throw it into the mix with the other exact interpretations of quantum mechanics, and continue to look for a way to decide between them. Some of the other interpretations are already very bizarre, so this would only be an extra step into bizarreness. ",

            "answer_text": "You cannot get evidence that objects are not real because evidence can only be obtained through the usage of objects, be it our hands or geiger counters. Thus, what we obtain from the usage of objects will always assume that objects exist (if the didn\u2019t exist we wouldn\u2019t be using them). Quantum physics says many things about reality, like the superposition principle or the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, but none of those imply the non-existence of objects. They do, however, imply that some characteristics of objects can only be known when measured, as the momentum and position of a particle, which does not in any way mean that they do not exist whilst not being measured, as many like to infer.
