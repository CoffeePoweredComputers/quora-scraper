            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an idealization. In fact it\u2019s arguable whether there are effectively any point charges in practice - electrons do behave like point particles in very high-speed collisions, but at everyday energies quantum effects smear them into fuzzy blobs, the size of, well, atoms, because that\u2019s how atoms get their size. But on experimental scales much larger than atoms, electron are typically good approximations to point charges again, and behave according to Coulomb\u2019s law. And if you know how a point charge behaves, you can easily generalize to an arbitrary charge distribution. ",
