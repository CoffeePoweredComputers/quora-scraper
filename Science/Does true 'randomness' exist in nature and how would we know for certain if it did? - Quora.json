            "answer_text": "Randomness in nature is very relative, mostly it\u2019s scale-dependent, or local vs. global. In physics-speak we would say it\u2019s not scale-invariant. A couple of examples: Imagine hovering a thousand feet over a dense jungle, looking at the \u201ccanopy\u201d of branches and leaves below. Is the orientation of the leaves random? Of course they are. Now drop to within a few inches of one of the outermost minor branches, with leaves attached to opposing sides of the branch. Still random? Hardly.Look up at the stars on a cloudless moonless night. Are the stars in random positions? Except for those imagined patterns called constellations, yes they are. But imagine being about a million light years over the \u201cnorth pole\u201d of the Milky Way and looking \u201cdown\u201d on it, are the stars still random? No they\u2019re not, they form a bright central bulge with spiral arms extending outward (this assumes you have very sensitive eyes).I could think of a few others, but you get the point. What\u2019s random is a matter of perspective: there\u2019s both order and randomness in nature, it depends on how it\u2019s being looked at. As for mathematical randomness (random numerical values), I would submit that perfect randomness should have two attributes: (1) The absence of well-defined statistical properties, eg, the data points fitting a Gaussian distribution are not truly random because we can predict, in a probabilistic sense, what range of values the next datum will fall into, and (2) Random data should not have bounds \u2014- with all values outside the bounds excluded, a given data set would not be perfectly random. My choice for random data values is the set {x = tan(theta)}, where the angle theta is generated randomly from a uniform distribution over the open interval, (-pi/2 < theta < pi/2). ",

            "answer_text": "By all appearances, yes. Surprisingly, it\u2019s also testable. Here\u2019s a proposition for you that follows from the definition of randomness: If I set up an experiment, and I give you enough information about the setup ahead of time to where you can accurately predict the result before I do the experiment, then the result of that experiment is not random. If, for example, I give you enough information about a coin toss\u2014the coin\u2019s initial position, its linear and angular momenta, etc.\u2014you could sit down with a pen and paper, and, in principle, work out with perfect accuracy which side of the coin will land face-up. So coin tosses aren\u2019t truly random. They\u2019re only pseudo-random. The fact that you could write down the result of my experiment before I actually did it has an interesting implication: The result exists whether or not I actually carry the experiment out. But if there\u2019s an experiment whose result does not exist without actually performing it, then that experiment\u2019s result must be truly random. It turns out that this is the implication of quantum mechanics: That well-defined eigenstates\u2014the results of measurement\u2014don\u2019t actually exist until we measure them. The outcome of such an measurement, then, must be fundamentally unpredictable. Truly random. Interestingly, Einstein opposed this view, and argued that quantum systems contain hidden variables: Information baked into the system that ensures the result of measurement is always predictable; at least in principle, if not in practice. So hidden variables, being, well, hidden, would make quantum mechanics appear to contain true randomness, even though in reality quantum mechanics would be entirely deterministic. Einstein published this argument in the famous EPR paper of 1935. It turns out that Einstein\u2019s hidden variable proposition is testable, by a series of experiments proposed by John Bell in the 1960s. Bell\u2019s experiments, which were subsequently performed, showed that quantum mechanics cannot be both local (no faster than light communication) and contain hidden variables as Einstein proposed. Since locality is a rather unassailable pillar of physics, the modest assumption is that Einstein\u2019s hidden variables are invalid. So the results of measurement in quantum mechanics do not appear to exist prior to performing the measurement. In other words, there are measurements in quantum mechanics whose result cannot be predicted in advance, even if you know everything there is to know about the state of the system prior to measurement. This appears to show that the universe, at its most basic level, contains true randomness. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure it does. Unpredictability is the definition of random, more or less (Randomness - Wikipedia). Many things are probabilities and not predictable. After all, if randomness did NOT exist, the universe would be entirely predictable, but it isn\u2019t. KNOWING or recognizing random might be a more difficult prospect because it is difficult to know without complete information whether the observation we made was of a random event. Also, generating randomness is complicated, because you have to make some kind of rule to generate the number - and if it follows a rule, it isn\u2019t truly random. That just goes to show you, in theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they\u2019re not. ",

Pseudorandomness is fake randomness, not really random at all, only designed to look like random. For all pseudorandomness there is an intelligent being who has selected each \u201crandom\u201d value or the algorithm and the seed value producing them. We cannot know for certain that true randomness exists, but we can safely assume that it does, until proven otherwise. Proving otherwise would require showing the intelligence behind all naturally occurring randomness, that could not possibly be man-made. ",
