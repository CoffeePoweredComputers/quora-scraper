            "answer_text": "Economists are obsessed with lost decades. Due to his obsession with the economic failings of 1990s Japan, many people associate this terminology with former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke. The phrase has also been applied to the first decade of the new American millennium. Basically, a country\u2019s economy earns this moniker after an extended period of extreme underperformance. At minimum, its stock market exhibits negative real returns for a 10-year period, reflecting an economy with persistently low and even at times negative economic growth. In this sense, both Japan and America\u2019s \u201clost decades\u201d are well justified. However, there is another \u201clost decade\u201d in the modern international economic order fashioned by Bretton Woods that predates these two famous examples \u2013 Latin America in the 1980s \u2013 a period in which not only a single country but an entire region was plunged into persistent economic malaise. Given the proximity of thiscollection of countries to the long-time economic hegemon of the United States, development scholars have devoted much hand-wringing to the future prospects of Latin America, particularly the largest and most indebted nations of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. (1) In surveying this landscape in 1989 while organizing a conference for the Institute of International Economics, John Williamson feared that Latin American countries would continue \u201cmuddling through\u201d their crises and extend their \u201clost decade\u201d even further. (2) In discussing these grim prospects, he coined the term \u2018Washington Consensus\u2019 to describe a package of policies that \u201ccommands high agreement in Washington political and technocratic circles.\u201d He believed that this policy suite offered a prescription for the long-term economic health of a developing country. Or at least he could hope. However, even Williamson himself equivocates on exactly which methods in Washington\u2019s program of \u201cmacroeconomic prudence, outward orientation and \u2018free market\u2019 capitalism\u201d are effectively used to stabilize and promote growth in developing economies. (3) The typical rundown of the Washington Consensus is a laundry list of ten items that describe America\u2019s preferred policy mechanisms for the amelioration of developing economies. However, Williamson admits to just four enduring aspects: fiscal discipline, tax reform, competitive exchange rates, and foreign private investment. The others, which include property rights, privatization, and deregulation, prove to be too abstract and contentious for true systematization. (4) Despite criticism from its inception, the conference and subsequent book that yielded the Washington Consensus were well received. Since 1990, hundreds of books and articles have been written on the subject. Although the Washington Consensus may not be as tidy as its original 10-point checklist, the term has come to indicate the generalized neoliberal American perspective on international development economics.

            "answer_text": "John Williamson, the inventor of the term \u201cWashington Consensus\u201d later identified three ways it had come to be used. In 1989, Williamson identified a list of ten reforms widely recommended for Latin American countries at the time, but the international financial institutions and the US government. This was the original meaning. These encouraged the kinds of reforms adopted by Western governments a decade earlier: floating currencies, free trade, privatization, low government borrowing and so on.Over the next decade, Williamson\u2019s original list was augmented into an institutionalist framework for reform, elaborated later by Rodrik. This included everything from labor market flexibility, and anti-corruption, to anti-poverty measures.An amorphous set of anti-statist, neo-colonialist policies supposedly foisted by the international financial institutions on countries coming and asking for help. In this usage, it borders on a conspiracy theory, in which everything the development community does is seen as deliberately impoverishing its clients to the advantage of multi-national corporations.The original ten point consensus remains very influential, even among those who believe in the existence of, and oppose, the amorphous third sense.
