            "answer_text": "There is no known upper limit at all. There was a paper quite recently though that showed one interesting upper limit for the mechanisms of Black Hole growth. The normal method is by accretion, matter that comes closer than a certain distance starts to spiral in (Innermost Stable Circular Orbit, ISCO). But that only works if the object truly crosses below that distance (which is even direction-dependant\u2026). Or on passing gas clouds, if their self-gravity is weaker than the tidal forces of the Black Hole. That limit is still a bit uncertain, but it seems to be around 70 billion solar masses iirc. From there on, only direct infall can feed a Black Hole. It will still grow, but that growth will be somewhat slower. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no known upper limit. This is filler text to appease the Quora moderation bot. Quora, if there are any human moderators reading this, you know that forcing people to write more is counterproductive to providing better or more relevant answers, right? It obfuscates the actual information with filler and discourages answers that are to the point and actually address the question with nonsensical requirements. Thanks! ",
