            "answer_text": "If you're asking for the actual mechanism that makes atoms shed their mass, and then in turn that mass is converted into energy. No one knows why it happens we only know that it happens. Simply put in Fusion you got two atoms fusing together to form another heavier atom. But when those atoms mass is accounted for the math doesn't match. And it doesn't matches because some of the mass (less than 0.4%) is converted into energy. In Fission you need a heavy element with an unstable atomic nucleus. You then fire a neutron at that element and the neutron will hit one of the nucleus splitting it apart. In the splitting process some of the mass is converted into energy in the form of radiation. When an atom is broken apart usually two or more neutrons are released in the process. That's why in order to avoid critical mass situations the reactors have control rods made of elements that naturally absorb neutrons. But to explain why exactly mass is converted into energy or why only in those amounts. That's something that works under laws that are unknown to us. A good example of those laws is the fine tuning of the four fundamental forces (Electromagnetism, Strong and Weak Nuclear Force, and Gravity). Take for example Electromagnetism! Its value is 8.988 \u00d7 10^9 N m\u00b2 C^-2 If the value had been exactly 9, then all stars would burned out too quickly and the necessary elements for life would not exist. If the value had been exactly 8, then no stars would've ever formed and thus the universe would be have nothing but distributed Matter doing nothing. But if you ask why these values have to be this way, no one can tell you that! They simply are! And to some that fine tuning is the proof of some grand design. Proof that the universe had to be created. But as I see it, it is only extremely interesting, but not actual proof of intelligent design or intention in the creation of the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "The way that I tend to visualise it is that it doesn't. Different atomic nuclei need different amounts of binding energy to hold their contents (which are predominantly positively charged, and hence mutually repulsive) together. But it is not a linear function, but more a \"U-shaped\" one, because of the way different combinations of neutrons plus protons are able to interact. So, simplistically, for me, fusion energy is just the surplus binding energy released when you split one enormous atomic nucleus (U or Pu for example) into two smaller ones (Ba and Kr for example). Meanwhile, fission energy is just the surplus binding energy released when you fuse two small atomic nuclei (D and T, for example) into one bigger one (He for example). (With iron, Fe, somewhere around the bottom of the U-shaped curve, and hence the boundary between what counts as a small atomic nucleus, and what counts as a large one.) However, when chemists come along to measure the masses of each of these elements (D, T, He, Kr, Ba, U, Pu) to write a value on their period table, what they measure includes the masses of the constituent particles plus their constituent energies (including the binding energies). So, the conversion from energy to mass occurs at this point, in the minds of the measurement chemists, as they take their readings.... perfectly validly, of course... I'm not saying it is an illusion... it is a perfectly correct view... but one that I personally think gets in the way of answering your particular question.
