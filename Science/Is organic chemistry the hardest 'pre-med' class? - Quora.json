            "answer_text": "I can only speak for myself, of course. For me, Organic Chemistry was not hard, at all. In fact, Orgo was actually my favorite pre-med class. Let me clarify what I mean by \u201cnot hard\u201d\u2014 the content wasn\u2019t hard to learn, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t require a lot of effort. Now the reason I feel this way isn\u2019t because I\u2019m a genius or just \u201cone of those lucky students who ace every test without studying\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m far from that. Personally, I think I found it kinda easy because I like the skills that are needed in Orgo. Additionally, I didn\u2019t go in there thinking it was going to be hard.  Orgo has gotten a bad reputation. Namely, for being thought of as this impossible carbon-filled beast. I think part of the reason for the collectively groan amongst pre-meds when it comes to Orgo is because they have been told since the first day entering college that Orgo is extremely hard \u2014 and it will weed out the students who are not cut out for medical school. There\u2019s a little thing called the self-fulling prophecy. If you go into this class expecting it to be the hardest subject in the entire pre-med curriculum, you\u2019re going start seeing carbon and hydrogen as the most menacing elements on the periodic table; or you\u2019ll look at a mechanism and want to spontaneously combust. You\u2019ll create a mental roadblock for yourself because of the horror stories that you\u2019ve heard about Orgo. Now if you go in there excited to learn and tackle this course, I think you\u2019ll find that the beast is actually a normal-sized dog. Orgo is beautiful!  Drawing out mechanisms is actually fun, in my opinion. The ability to envision where a reaction is going step-by-step is what makes it enjoyable to learn. It allows us to conceptualize better and improve our spatial reasoning. Predicting the details of a reaction and different outcomes will also prove beneficial to your career as a medical professional. Organic chemistry shouldn\u2019t be seen as a difficult burden (certainly not to the point where it\u2019s made to seem impossible). It\u2019s doable and beneficial. Most importantly enjoy drawing those mechanisms!!!  I\u2019d like to add that the same thing happens with the MCAT. We have been told that it\u2019s this impossible, monster of a test. It\u2019s really not that bad. As with all things, as long as you prepare and work hard, you\u2019ll overcome it. ",

            "answer_text": "Yep. Actually, at least when I was a high school student here in Turkey, chemistry wasn\u2019t that hard among the four main subjects you need for medical school. Mathematics was widely considered the hardest(with geometry being especially loathed), after that it was a contest between chemistry and biology. Physics usually was the easiest. But chemistry \u2018wasn\u2019t that hard\u2019 because non-organic chemistry, while not simple by any means, was pretty doable. The organic part though\u2026 Well, I had a great organic chemistry teacher, and I found the subject rather fun(by school standards, that is) but God it was not easy. I\u2019d easily vote it hardest part of getting into the med school, though perhaps rivaled by geometry. ",
