            "answer_text": "Is sex prohibited in Islam? Yes. Unless done by the standards Allah has set. It would then actually become rewarding Is alchemy prohibited in Islam? Yes. Unless done by the standards Allah has set. I obviously don\u2019t know the exact means of achieving it. But I do know that in general our spirit is a very very powerful one. However in this life it is bound to our body and therefore weaken and chained. Some people are able to break themselves from it. They have been able to unleash the power of their spirit. But just by having powers it doesn\u2019t mean you are a good person just as not having powers mean you are a bad person. So how can you have powers and be good? By following the wajibs and avoiding the haram. By following the mustahab and avoiding the makruk to its full extent ( which I believe is a very rare trait) and awaiting that Allah grants you. Sticking with your prayer and fasting and avoid sinning. \u2190 the power comes from \u0639\u0628\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0647 ie worship and service to Allah So how can you have powers and be bad? Avoiding follow the wajibs and following the haraam. Staying in a cave for years, avoiding marriage, eating very little food. Saying specific zikrs(Any zikr would do as long as it's repeated enough:)) You are basically empowering your spirit but in a wrong way. \u2190 the power comes from zikr & spiritual exercise like doping. It isn\u2019t approved by God.  Bare in mind we have not come to this world to glorify ourselves. We have come to glorify Allah the exalted. The highest rank is given to Prophet Muhammad. Do you know what was his rank? \u0627\u0634\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0647 \u0648 \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644\u0647 I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger. Muhammad isn\u2019t known to be the greatest alchemist. He is known to be the most humble, caring, loving pious man. The highest of positions is the one most serving to God and not empowering of himself. All prophets were given such powers, but since they were prophets they were cool people who didn\u2019t nuke others with their powers \u2190 This was also their test to be given power but not to use it. I had a teacher who was offered by some guy to learn stuff (not alchemy but some other powers). My teacher said: Not interested! I asked him why he said: the best thing one can have is servitude to Allah (and perhaps be in need before him and not get proud by powers that could distance you away from Allah). It took me a years to process that. ",

To speak of alchemy in the present tense is rather silly\u2026. It\u2019s a mystical discipline that has long since been eclipsed by chemistry and physics. We know very well that there is no such thing as a \u201cphilosopher\u2019s stone\u201d and that the \u201ctransmutation\u201d of elements takes place in nuclear reactors by creating isotopes of existing elements. No one (at least, no one in the western world) takes \u201calchemy\u201d as anything other than a footnote in history. ",
