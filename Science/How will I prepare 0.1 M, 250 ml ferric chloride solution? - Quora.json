            "answer_text": "We know that valency factor of FeCl3 is 3 anf its molecular weight is 162 . Since milliequivalent of both should be equal so let Weight of FeCl3 needed be x molecular weight be m =162 molarity be M =0.1 Volume be V=250 ml We equate milliequivalents on both side using the formula [math]1000\\dfrac {x}{m}=M.V[/math] Putting values, [math]1000\\dfrac {x}{162}=0.1*250[/math] Solving we get We will get x=4.05g So we beed to mix 4.05g of FeCl3 to prepare a solution which is 0.1M and has a volume of 250ml ",

            "answer_text": "Molarity is defined as number of moles of a substance dissolved in 1L of solution. So if we want to prepare 0.1M solution of FeCl3, we will have to add 0.1 moles of FeCl3 in 1L of solution. Therefore we will have to mix 0.025 moles of FeCl3 in 250 ml solution to prepare 0.1M solution. In terms of mass it would be 0.025*162.5 = 4.0625g of FeCl3 in 250ml to prepare 0.1M solution. U can ask these kind of doubts on my fb page \u201cChemastery\u201d. ",
