            "answer_text": "Having been raised in a home with very strong beliefs, people who have not had that experience may have a hard time understanding it. I lived in it and have a hard time understanding it. You are surrounded by people who have the same beliefs. It\u2019s a culture - our beliefs were a reality reinforced by everyone around us. More realistically, our beliefs were not beliefs in our mind. Our lives and how we lived were reality. Yes, based on beliefs but not in our minds. Our reality came from our parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, and a slew of people who came before us, related and not. We might say to \u201coutsiders\u201d that \u201cour beliefs are\u2026\u201d. But, to us they were not beliefs. We simply knew that outsiders wouldn\u2019t understand our reality without that intro. Today, I see those \u201crealities\u201d as beliefs but I know and am related to many people who continue to \u201cbelieve\u201d. I know that there is no way that any outsider, including myself or scientists who have evidence that may contradict their reality, would be able to argue individuals out of that system. The way those of us got out was through experiences that caused us to begin to wonder. Even later in my begin to move away from that life, if someone tried to argue me out of it, it would have little to no effect. As a result, today I have very high resistance to anyone trying to convince me of anything. Even science. I actually think I \u201cbelieved\u201d in science more when I knew I had to live a certain way in order to be \u201csaved\u201d. Science, in our world wasn\u2019t a bad thing, though our own realities were higher than it was. So I see the questioner a bit off. We saw no discrepancy between things that scientist discovered and our way of life. We benefited from science. Some of us became scientists. But we also realized that there were things that scientists couldn\u2019t explain and we didn\u2019t try to (other than, perhaps,\u201dGod works in mysterious ways\u201d). For example, this from an astronomy site: Wouldn't the Big Bang theory be considered a hypothesis and not a theory? (Intermediate) Just the fact that the writer says, \u201cI think that there is enough evidence for the Big Bang that it should be called a theory.\u201d suggests that science may not have it right. And, even if science does have it right, there are still so many unanswered questions around the evidence (where did the big bang come from?). In the world that I came from, we didn\u2019t necessarily not believe in things that were scientifically proven. We believed that there was a higher power who made that scientifically proven thing irrelevant. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been plagued by this problem for years, especially when it comes to intelligent people, scientists in fact, who engage the faculties of reason, rationality, the scientific method to their work, to their family life, to their communities etc, but then throw all that out, when it comes to their chosen version of religion! My best guesses are\u2026 god of the gaps. Imagine for a moment, prior to 1440 when Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press & gave birth to the great renaissance, people didn\u2019t have much knowledge, just theories; some good, some bad, but regardless, understandable since we had nothing else to organize our lives around. As an example, one year we had a great harvest. People ate & felt well. The next year, the harvest was bad. People starved & got sick. Why? Today, thanks to science, we know why. We can explain weather, disease etc. In fact, we can organize our lives in fantastically brilliant ways to mitigate & sometimes even prevent bad weather or infestations or disease from annihilating us. Prior to this understanding, our ancestors filled their lack of knowledge with imaginary forces & named them gods. We had Demeter, the god of the harvest; Aphrodite, the god of love etc. We used to appeal to gods for many different challenges we faced. As we invented mass transportation such as ships, we encountered other people groups & Ares, the god of war, was invoked to fight Odin, another god of war (same futile belief, just different name/traditions/geography). And on and on. These various gods however, have been reduced to mostly monotheisms (one god; although we are having to live with three all duking it out for the title at this point of our history). As our knowledge expanded to understand why people fall in love or why the harvest didn\u2019t come etc, we reduced the number of gods needed to explain these challenges. The \u201cgaps\u201d in our knowledge were reduced. We still have quite a few gaps left, hence religion still has a strangle hold on theories like life-after-death or the origins of the Universe etc. The theory of god inventing life, fills this gap. In the Western world, we\u2019ve accomplished SO MUCH! Which brings me to my next best guess\u2026 the Pareto distribution. Most people know it as the 80/20 rule & you\u2019ve definitely heard the expression, 80% of the work is accomplished by only 20% of the people. As a general rule (& it\u2019s general, not specific), the great accomplishments of the renaissance for example, were accomplished by a minority of people. Today, it\u2019s the same. It requires effort to understand the world & not simply give up discipline & maturity to conclude that god did it! Most people want to be spoon-fed & hearsay stories of gods taking care of them is a lot easier to swallow than \u201cget off your butt, work hard to understand life, contribute to society, be mature etc.\u201d So that covers why some people believe in things with little, hearsay, or no evidence, but what about my opening thoughts of those great scientific thinkers, part of the 20%, who abdicate their rational discipline, to continue putting a god in the gaps of their knowledge? My friend, at this point, I really don\u2019t know about these remaining few! It boggles my mind. I welcome any thoughts on the matter. ",
