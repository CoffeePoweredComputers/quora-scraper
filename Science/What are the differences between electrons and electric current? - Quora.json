            "answer_text": "electrons are the charge Particles and each electron having the charge of -1.6 x 10^-19 C . While electric current is due to the flow of free electrons. Thus more free charge flow means more current.Electrics current flows in the direction opposite to the charge. Charge may be minority carrier or majority carrier. Current flow in the BJT are due to both majority and as well as minority Carrier while in FET it's due to only majority carriers.The density of the free electrons varies in the insulator, conductor and semiconductor thus their conductivity also varies in accordance with it.Electric current (I) can be represent in the term's of charge(Q) as : I = Q /t, where t is the time. This equation is the most general equation for deriving the current for BJT's, FET's etc. Unit of charge is \u2192 Culomb and that of Current is \u2192 Ampere.",

            "answer_text": "An electric current (measured in Amperes, which is the number of Coulombs of electric charge per second) consists of a flow of charged particles, in the same way that a water current consists of a flow of water molecules. Those charged particles can be any.They could be dust particles that each carry an electric charge.More likely, they could be molecules or atoms that are ionised (positive or negative) in an electrolytic cell, or a vacuum tube.But most likely, they are electrons (maybe in a vacuum tube, but the vast majority of the time that we encounter them, in a metal conductor, like a length of electric cable). So, electrons only constitute an electric current if they are flowing (notably in an electric cable); and an electric current is *usually* created by a flow of electrons. ",
