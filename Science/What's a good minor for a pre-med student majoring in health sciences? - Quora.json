            "answer_text": "Great question. Crititical thinking is essential if you want to be a successful physician. As you probably know, information is accumulating at an ever quickening pace, so it's therefore unlikely that several courses in a specific subject will be helpful. The least successful docs I've known have difficulty with separating out extraneous information from essential info. You will be amazed at the amount of medical information coming at you. Think about a minor in philosophy. I can't think of another field of study that places such a premium on the ability to think. As a doc, you'll be thinking all the time\u2026 Also, many (or most) physicians will operate in a managerial position in the future (you'll supervise nurses, P.A.s, N.P.s, and many others). A minor in management wouldn't hurt, either. ",
