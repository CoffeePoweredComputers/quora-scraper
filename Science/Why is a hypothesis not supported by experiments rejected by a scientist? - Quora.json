            "answer_text": "A hypothesis is what a scientist will propose as a truth. He will then run experiments to test the validity of the hypothesis. It continues to be tested by different scientist and if over a period of time, if all the possibilities are expended with no false results the hypothesis becomes a law of physics. So that is the way it works. Hypothesis are never rejected by scientist because there is nothing to reject. It is just a proposal that something might be true. ",

If a theoretical statement lacks a supporting experimental evidence, the statement is not ttreated as acceptable and it is generally not pursued for very long. If an experimental evidence goes against a theoretical statement, the statement is treated as invalid, and it is generally not pursued thereafter. ",
