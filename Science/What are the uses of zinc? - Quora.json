            "answer_text": "Zinc is a chemical element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It is the first element in group 12 of the periodic table. Atomic mass: 65.38 u \u00b1 0.002 u Electron configuration: [Ar] 3d104s2  Uses Most zinc is used to galvanise other metals, such as iron, to prevent rusting. Galvanised steel is used for car bodies, street lamp posts, safety barriers and suspension bridges. Large quantities of zinc are used to produce die-castings, which are important in the automobile, electrical and hardware industries. Zinc is also used in alloys such as brass, nickel silver and aluminium solder. Zinc oxide is widely used in the manufacture of very many products such as paints, rubber, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, plastics, inks, soaps, batteries, textiles and electrical equipment. Zinc sulfide is used in making luminous paints, fluorescent lights and x-ray screens. Biological role Zinc is essential for all living things, forming the active site in over 20 metallo-enzymes. The average human body contains about 2.5 grams and takes in about 15 milligrams per day. Some foods have above average levels of zinc, including herring, beef, lamb, sunflower seeds and cheese. Zinc can be carcinogenic in excess. If freshly formed zinc(II) oxide is inhaled, a disorder called the \u2018oxide shakes\u2019 or \u2018zinc chills\u2019 can occur. ",
