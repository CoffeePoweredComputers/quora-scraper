            "answer_text": "\u201cPrecise\u201d means \u201can answer that is very specific\u201d (e.g 3.412 rather than \u201cabout\u201d 3.4), and so it refers to a having the ability (thanks to your instruments) to measure things down to very small increments (and hence to express those measurements to many decimal places). This specificity usually implies that there will be a low random error (measurement error that changes randomly from one measurement to the next), since the measurement uncertainty can\u2019t really be more than one of small measurement increments, at most. A consequence of a low random error is that if you measure the same thing over and over again many times, all those answers will be pretty close together: the scatter among them will low. So the measurement answers will be quite repeatable. \u201cAccurate\u201d means \u201can answer that is very close to the true answer\u201d (just as the word suggests). And so it refers to having a low systemic error in your measurements. This is a measurement error that is systematically the same across repeated measurements. And so if you have a systematic error, you will always get the wrong answer in the same way (as opposed to random error where your wrongness is by a different, random amount every time). Given this information, can a set of measurements be precise, but inaccurate? Of course! It means that they are very specific and repeatable, but not very close to the truth. Suppose the true value of something you are measuring is 6. You do three measurements with a very precise instrument, and you get 3.00015, 3.00018, and 3.00012. It appears your measurements are systematically too low by about 3. Must be problem with your measuring device. So even though your measurements are very precise (the random error is small at something like +/- 0.00003), your measurements are not very accurate at all (because the systematic error is huge, at -3). Granted, if you had no systematic error, and only random measurement errors, then more precision would generally imply more accuracy, because a smaller random error would mean any given measurement would be closer to the truth than if you had a larger random error. But this is not always the case: systematic errors are pretty common and they can be pernicious. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets take a nice clock. eithe analog or digital it doesn\u2019t really matter. It has a second hand or a seconds display and we can read one second quite clearly to a resolution of 1 second. That clock has great precision meaning resolution of 1 second and there fore a precision of 1 part in 43,200 seconds per 12 hours. We can read it to one whole second. But someone did not set the clock to the right time. either because it was set to the wrong time (offset error) - say 5 minutes ahead - or it was set 5 days ago but runs fast 1 minute per day (an erroneous rate or gain.) So when you tell me its 03:45 and 15 seconds I get a very precise reading down to a second but its useless precision as it\u2019s not accurate being five minutes off; the inaccuracy is way larger than the precision. In consideration, a measurement should have precision and accuracy commensurate with each other, or at least constrain the display of precision to about the known accuracy. Precision without accuracy is a false beacon. ",

            "answer_text": "Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a standard or known value. For example, if in lab you obtain a weight measurement of 3.2 kg for a given substance, but the actual or known weight is 10 kg, then your measurement is not accurate. In this case, your measurement is not close to the known value. Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other. Using the example above, if you weigh a given substance five times, and get 3.2 kg each time, then your measurement is very precise. Precision is independent of accuracy. You can be very precise but inaccurate, as described above. You can also be accurate but imprecise. For example, if on average, your measurements for a given substance are close to the known value, but the measurements are far from each other, then you have accuracy without precision. A good analogy for understanding accuracy and precision is to imagine a basketball player shooting baskets. If the player shoots with accuracy, his aim will always take the ball close to or into the basket. If the player shoots with precision, his aim will always take the ball to the same location which may or may not be close to the basket. A good player will be both accurate and precise by shooting the ball the same way each time and each time making it in the basket. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A Kudos to Travis Casey for pointing out that precision and accuracy are different things. Accuracy is determined by the number of significant figures in the value. The more significant figures, the more accurate the value. Precision is determined by the size of the units used measure a value. The smaller the unit, the more precise the measurement. This brings us to the issue of error. An error is not a mistake. An error sets the limits of accuracy. Errors may be random. Random errors are equally positive and negative. They are distributed about the average or mean. Errors may be systematic. Systematic errors are either all positive or all negative. A miscalibrated instrument will likely give systematic error. The most important word in this A2A is incorrect. Although using a miscalibrated instrument may be considered to carelessness, one can conceive situations in which it is not. However, the word incorrect implies one or more of any number of foul-ups. ",

            "answer_text": "The two words (precise, accurate), have different meanings. It is most noticable in thermometers. You have thermometres of different construction, and the process is usually to set some points at 0 and 100 C. But if you measure something at 30 C, then you may get different readings because the scales are \u2018almost linear\u2019. So a temperature of 30.2 degrees on A can be distinct from 30.1 or 30.3, and the difference might be exact in the calculations. If something happens at 30.2 on A, and you can reliably get 30,2 on A with many measurements, then it is precise. But 30.2% from 0\u2013100 on scale A, may become 30.8% on scale B. B is just as precise in that the differences are the same at this point, but it is possible that neither A nor B are the \u2018true temperature\u2019. The true temperature is found by a differential gas thermometer, the value extrapolated to zero pressure. It\u2019s a fairly complex process, and it is usually done to establish points, rather than as a day-to-day thermometer. It might give 30.4 for this temperature. It is accurate, but it is very difficult to measure differences, and so not precise. ",
