            "answer_text": "Take an auger and dig up some soil from one part of field.Spread the soil on a newspaper.Remove roots, stones, debris etc.Now divide the soil in four parts and remove two parts. Now mix well the remaining two parts.After mixing do the same process again.Now from the final mixture take 20 g of soil and transfer into 100 ml beaker.Add 40 ml distilled water and stir well with a glass rod.Now allow this to stand for half an hour.Now calibrate your pH meter with pH 7, pH 4 and pH 9.2 buffer. You can make buffer solution by dissolving standard buffer tablets in distilled water.Now dip the electrode of pH meter into the water suspension of the settled sample.You can read the pH from digital display of pH meter.You can repeat this with several other soil samples collected from different parts of field to get an idea of pH for the whole field.You can buy a handy pH meter from- Reli Power PNS044 Hanna PH Meter HI 96107 Water Tester Reverse Osmosis:Amazon For some home methods of determining pH visit- 4 Ways to Test Soil pH ",

            "answer_text": "With soil pH probe: Dig a hole 2\u20134 inches deep in your soil Fill it with distilled water (distilled has a close to 7 pH that won't interfere with the soil) Once the hole has become murky, put the ph tester in and wait about a minute to get an accurate reading:  Without a meter: get a sample of dirt from different areas of your garden and mix it up  Take two spoonfuls and put them in different trays/bowls Pour vinegar on one sample, and if it fizzes, your soils is alkaline and you don't need the next step Pour water in the other sample until it is muddy, and then proceed to pour baking soda on it If it bubbles, then it is acidic If you got no fizzling from either test, repeat the process If there still isn't fizzling the congratulations, your soul has a pH close to 7 which is optimal for most plants.
