            "answer_text": "So this question is a bit long in the tooth, but I think it's still relevant today. Maybe even more so. The short answer is that it depends on you. The outsourcing apocalypse that people feared never really occurred. People realized that \u201cyou get what you pay for\u201d applies even to outsourced labor, and after enough projects went up in flames, big companies started hiring onshore developers again. Strong software engineers have been in high demand now for at least two decades, and based on data I've seen recently, that's likely to continue to be the case. Strong engineers may even become harder to find; really good engineers are already commanding $500k+ compensation packages. I've heard rumors of $1M+ packages. Even unknown but strong engineers make $200k+ at tech companies. But there is a catch. Not everyone can become a strong engineer. It's not all about effort, nor is it all about willingness to learn. Yes, you need to work. Yes, you need to learn constantly. But skill is the deciding factor. There is a core aptitude that you either have or you don't. It comes in degrees; if you lack it completely you probably will be able to tell, in that, no matter how much you learn, it never seems to make sense. In the middle, you can eventually work hard enough to learn one domain to the point where you may be employable, at least for a while. But learning a new domain isn't easy, and it will be common for you to get stuck or take a long time. And it's only toward the higher end that you'll be able to get the best jobs. Because the word is out: Programmers can make a lot of money. And software engineering isn't subject to being automated away like many other jobs. So at the least talented end of the programming spectrum, the competition for the few jobs that hire mediocre developers is extreme. Like 100 resumes for every open position extreme. I just read one answer that said that every year his company filters through 2000 resumes, interviewing maybe a hundred, and then sending out a single offer. For a mid-tier position. Is programming a good career choice? It's hard to beat if you have the knack. And it's hard to succeed if you don't. It's totally worth trying to see if you've won the genetic lottery, but trying to be a programmer when it's not a good fit may lead to a life of frustration and failure. Learn to program. If you spend a solid six months and it still doesn't seem natural, then you might want to consider other career paths. If it does make sense, then welcome to the club! I think you'll enjoy it here, and the pay's good. ",

            "answer_text": "I would put programming up there with professions such as * engineer, lawyer and doctor, especially after including student debt.  If you are average, you will have a spectacularly average career and may have to downsize greatly during poor job markets.  If you are below average, you may float by in good years, and fall spectacularly when you can't find work during bad years.  If you are well above average, you will thrive regardless of the job market. How good you are as a software engineer will depend heavily on (at least) these three things:1. Do you enjoy it?  If you don't enjoy it, you will very quickly fall behind, quite likely before you even finish school.2. Are you willing to work at it?  If you aren't willing to put in the time and effort, you will also fail spectacularly.3. How smart are you?  A strong work ethic can put someone of below average intelligence above someone of mediocre work ethic and average ability.  It may even put you on par with someone of high intelligence and a relatively weak work ethic.  However, at the end of the day, you will still be behind those of average and above average intelligence.  At the end of the day, 50% of people will be below the median. Ultimately, 1 and 2 matter far more than 3.  Choose a career path which has good job opportunities and which you enjoy and are willing to work at and all else will follow.  Software engineer is one such profession and there will always be a demand for talented software engineers.  What nobody can promise is that the software engineer market won't look like the law market today so from a purely financial perspective, I don't see much advantage or disadvantage in choosing to become a software engineer over another type of engineer or a doctor or a lawyer.
