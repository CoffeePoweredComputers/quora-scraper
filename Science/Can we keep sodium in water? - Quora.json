            "answer_text": "Sodium was first isolated by electrolysis of SODIUM HYDROXIDE.Sodium lies in group 1 denoted by Na and its atomic number is 11 relative atomic mass is 22.9 that we say 23 also belongs to \u201cs\u201d block element. Sodium is a soft metal that tarnishes within a seconds of being exposed to the air. It also reacts vigorously with water. Sodium is used as a heat exchanger in some nuclear reactor and as a reagent in chemical companies now the question raised in your mind why it tarnish when exposed to air or react vigorously with water. Ques: Why it tarnish when exposed to air or react vigorously with water? Here we go with the answer. Sodium belong to the family of Alkali elements.Alkali metals are all shiny, soft highly reactive metal at standard temperature and pressure and readily loses their outer most electron to form cations with charge +1. It tarnish when exposed to air to perform combustion and oxidation wit the help of oxygen and moisture present in air.Sodium is a very active element. It combines with oxygen at room temperature. When heated, it combines very rapidly, burning with a brilliant golden-yellow flameSodium also reacts violently with water. (See accompanying sidebar.) It is so active that it is normally stored under a liquid with which it does not react. Kerosene or naphtha are liquids commonly used for this purpose. Sodium also reacts with most other elements and with many compounds. It reacts with acids to produce hydrogen gas. It also dissolves in Mercury to form a sodium amalgam. An amalgam is an alloy of mercury and at least one other metal Now imagine there is only Na around you ? ",
