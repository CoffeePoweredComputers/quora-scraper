            "answer_text": "As Sandhya Uma Shekar states, it is because the brain fuses the 2 images to create 1 image. But the interesting part is how the brain uses the differences between the images to construct our 3d depth perception. Close 1 eye, and the world appears flat. There are still monocular cues to distance - far objects appear smaller, the outline of far objects is interrupted where they are obscured by nearer objects, and haze affects things far far away. But the actual 3D perception (also known as stereovision) is lost with 1 eye closed. Because the two eyes are slightly displaced, one on 1 side of our face, the other a few centimetres away on the other side. So the relative positions of things change when viewed from these 2 different angles, depending on how far away they are (see Parallax - Wikipedia). So when the brain tries to fuse these 2 images they don\u2019t match perfectly, because of these differences when viewing things at different distances from two different vantages. And from these differences, these imperfectly-fusing elements of the picture, the brain constructs our 3D perception. Which is well described by the term \u201cstereo-vision\u201d. The difference between 3d vs monoc vision, is like the difference between listening to music on stereo headphones, vs a handheld single-speaker transistor radio. Vive! ",

            "answer_text": "You don't see with your eyes, you see with your brain, which has an ability to create a coherent image of reality based on a variety of sensory organs, eyes being the most important. On top of that, your memory, experience and state of mind are playing a major role in creating this internal model of reality. Optical illusions and the tricks magicians and mentalists are playing on us are the best examples of how fallible this perception is. You can see things in your dreams while your eyes are closed. One eye, two eyes, doesn't matter if the brain is capable of constructing an image of reality. Sometimes, when the eyes become suddenly misaligned, we may have Diplopia. In this case, especially in children, often the brain will be able to suppress one of the images, which helps to create a coherent view of reality but may lead to amblyopia in kids. A slight difference in angle of viewing between the eyes helps in creating a three dimensional model of reality, as described in other answers, however we can mostly understand the relative location of objects in space even when using just one eye.
