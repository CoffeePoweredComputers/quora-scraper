            "answer_text": "What are the contributions of gravity in our scientific development? Primitive Gravity creates the mass of matter and magnetic energy from the Universe wide quasi electric Aether. Gravity at our level of reality, provides the ongoing support to enable the constant existing of the mass-density of our matter particles. Gravitation effect, which is often confused with Gravity, is responsible for the attraction between matter particles. Gravity and Gravitational Thermodynamic Effect, are responsible for all phenomena extant in the Universe. ",

            "answer_text": "I am not sure what you mean, but general relativity explains not only gravity but also resolves the age old philosophical question that the universe cannot be infinite (for a number of reasons, including that Newtonian gravity is not consistent in an infinite universe) and yet the universe cannot have a boundary or an outside. General relativity uniquely explains this and one only has to think to understand the truth of what it says. ",
