            "answer_text": "Are mathematicians normal people? The poor and mediocre ones are. :) The best mathematicians are sufficiently divergent from normal that they become the subject of mathematician jokes that are genuinely funny, like this one: The famous mathematician and computer scientist Professor John von Neumann said goodbye to his wife as he prepared to leave for his morning class. \u201cNow remember, dear,\u201d she told him, \u201cthe movers are coming today, so don\u2019t walk back here when you leave Princeton this afternoon. Go to the new house.\u201d Of course he forgot and walked back to their old house, only to find the locks had been changed, and looking through the window, the inside was empty. But luckily a child was sitting on the front stoop. He asked her, \u201cExcuse me, little girl, but do you happen to know where the von Neumanns moved to?\u201d She looked up at him, smiled, took his hand, and said, \u201cCome on, Daddy. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d Truly great mathematicians don\u2019t understand why this is funny. But what\u2019s even sadder is that you need to actually know math in order to appreciate the better mathematician jokes: Two math professors had a routine of meeting at the local bar after classes every Friday afternoon. Their conversation always seemed to turn to their undergraduate students, and this Friday was no different. Their discussion evolved into a friendly argument about whether it was worthwhile to teach Calculus to undergrads: would the course give them any lifelong skills and understanding, or would they simply forget everything they\u2019d been taught as soon as the final bell rang at the end of the semester? Professor Airdose argued that, even if they didn\u2019t remember the specifics, students would benefit from learning how to approach problems, and from understanding the basics of limits, slopes, sums of infinitesimals, and so on. His colleague, Professor Girdle, argued that most students tuned out during class, anyway, and learned only just enough to (usually) pass the tests. They kept at this for most of an hour, until Prof. Girdle excused himself to use the facilities. While he was gone, Prof. Airdose took the opportunity to call the bartender, an attractive coed, and ask her to help him trick his friend. \u201cWhen the other professor comes back, I\u2019d like to ask you a math question. All you need to do is say \u2018\u2153 x\u00b3\u2019 as the answer. Do you think you can do that?\u201d The young lady nodded and returned to her work, mumbling to herself, \u201cOne thir-dex cubed, one thir-dex cubed.\u201d Prof. Airdose began to wonder if this might have been a bad idea after all. Nonetheless, they briefly continued arguing upon Prof. Girdle\u2019s return, until Prof. Airdose offered to settle the debate once and for all. \u201cExcuse me, miss,\u201d he said, waving the bartender over, \u201cwould you happen to know the integral of x\u00b2 dx?\u201d Beaming with pride, she parroted, \u201cOne third x cubed!\u201d and began to walk away. As Prof. Girdle sat flabbergasted and a smug Prof. Airdose grinned from ear to ear, the bartender paused, looked over her shoulder at the two professors, and added, \u201cplus a constant, of course.\u201d It turns out that you can actually use math jokes to judge whether or not you\u2019re a decent mathematician: One of von Neumann\u2019s grad students (I\u2019m telling you: von Neumann was an incredible mathematician!) wanted to see if he could stump the old professor, so he asked him \u201cthe one about the bird and the cars.\u201d It goes like this: Two cars are facing each other, a mile apart. At a given signal, one starts driving toward the other at 35 M.P.H and the other starts driving toward the first at 25 M.P.H. Coincidentally, at exactly that moment, a bird leaves the front bumper of the first car and flies to the other car at a constant 120 M.P.H. For reasons known only to the bird, it immediately and instantaneously reverses direction upon reaching the bumper of the second car, returning to the first. It continues its ever-shortening journey back and forth between the cars until, in a remarkable example of storytelling mercy, the cars come to a halt exactly one bird\u2019s-width apart. How far has the bird flown? Unsurprisingly, the student had hardly finished explaining the problem before von Neumann answered correctly, \u201cTwo miles, of course.\u201d \u201cVery clever, Professor! I see you know the trick!\u201d replied the rather disappointed student. \u201cWhat trick?\u201d asked von Neumann. \u201cI summed the series.\u201d That one went over well with my pre-calc students just after we\u2019d discussed sums and sigma notation. But when I\u2019ve told it to my coworkers, one typically laughs out loud, several others politely listen quietly because they\u2019ve heard it three dozen times before, and the rest are still waiting for the punch line.

He was also, as Paul Hoffman documents in his book The Man Who Loved Only Numbers, a true eccentric\u2014a \u2018mathematical monk\u2019 who lived out of a pair of suitcases, dressed in tattered suits, and gave away almost all the money he earned, keeping just enough to sustain his meager lifestyle; a hopeless bachelor who was extremely (perhaps abnormally) devoted to his mother and never learned to cook or even boil his own water for tea; and a fanatic workaholic who routinely put in nineteen-hour days, sleeping only a few hours a night. Erd\u0151s owed his phenomenal stamina to amphetamines\u2014he took ten to twenty milligrams of Benzedrine or Ritalin daily. Worried about his drug use, a friend once bet Erd\u0151s that he wouldn\u2019t be able to give up amphetamines for a month. Erd\u0151s took the bet and succeeded in going cold turkey for thirty days. When he came to collect his money, he told his friend, \u2018You\u2019ve showed me I\u2019m not an addict. But I didn\u2019t get any work done. I\u2019d get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I\u2019d have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You\u2019ve set mathematics back a month.\u2019 After the bet, Erd\u0151s promptly resumed his amphetamine habit, which he supplemented with shots of strong espresso and caffeine tablets. \u2018A mathematician,\u2019 he liked to say, \u2018is a machine for turning coffee into theorems.'\u201d ",

I do very well with numbers always have, but I will say the abnormal thing I do is math while I sleep. Through college I only missed one question, through all my studies, simply wasn't paying attention. Teach would always give me bonus problems on my exams, just to make it difficult for me. People actually would get mad at me if I answered questions in lecture.. I remember people use to ask if I had already taking the courses, or why I am taking courses if I already know how to do it, but I didn't know until I seen it done once, but that's usually all I need. The few times I actually ran into any trouble I figure it out in my sleep. I don't know how it works, or why. Some how if I concentrate on a mathematical problem, focus on it in my mind for a few min, like a relaxed meditation, before going to bed my brain with solve it before I wake up the next day, like I said idk how or why. it just works, . I am not a mathematician.. , I do love it though. The sleep math freaked me out at first, then I started useing it and.. wow its like my own super power in a way. For awhile people didn't believe me until My ex felt she needed to test it.. so using her calculus book she would give me a random problem to solve each night for a week.and every night they would get tougher and be longer, she had failed out of calc twice so she really wanted to get me jammed up. I got every single one correct, I had done calc long ago so not super hard or surprising, but still that is a lot of numbers to program in your brain overnight somehow arrange them in my head solve it and still have a fresh answer that next day ",

            "answer_text": "The funny truth is that Mathematicians really are normal people who have a different skill set than most. They are trained in logic and challenge themselves to think on really deep complicated logical subjects. Most of the time their days are spent putting together logic structures to convey overarching messages which we call \u201cProofs\u201d. Ultimately though, they have varying personalities, hopes, dreams, and goals just like everyone else. At their core, they function just like everyone else. Some lose sight of this because their way of thinking is valuable to many and they are put on a pedestal, but at the end of the day there isn\u2019t anything different about who they are or how they function than anyone else. If you want to see people whoa re often a lot like Mathematicians, you can talk to professional musicians. I have a lot of friends who are in orchestras and symphonies at a high level, and their lives are extremely relatable to that of a Mathematician. There is a lot of grind work in the background to create and present something valuable to the rest of the world, and often very few people will ever appreciate what is presented. ",

(S)he may be intrigued by seemingly innocuous phenomena (like what day of the year does the sunlight happen to shine through a window at the top of the stairs and graze each step then hit the toilet dead on?) A number theorist often knows factorizations of many large integers that others could care less about. And so on. ",

Attempting to prove 1=0 and as a result fooling some of these perfectly sensible boys into believing you. Should you be able to show the cheat and explain how it is done you may merely clean the board. If not, it is a detention and clean the board\u201d.

Once I went to a big AMS/MAA joint conference. The way to tell the difference between the mathematicians and the tourists was that the mathematicians were dressed a little like business people, because we were going to a conference. We all looked so average. Being a mathematician is a middle-class occupation, which seems to be becoming an unusual thing. Academic freedom and tenure used to make it a better job. Lack of intellectual curiosity is treated as normal but it\u2019s not. ",
