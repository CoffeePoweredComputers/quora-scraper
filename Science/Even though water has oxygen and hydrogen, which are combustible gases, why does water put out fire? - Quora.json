            "answer_text": "Burning is a chemical process where it includes two components a fuel (H) and oxidizer (oxygen) and also heat (ignition temp) Hydrogen is highly flammable it appears as gas in nature containing two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to each other this gas is highly reactive and oxidizes in presence of oxidiser making it flammable and oxygen is an natural oxidizer present on earth abundantly which supports burning of fire. hydrogen gas is highly flammable. All it needs is an oxidant to start burning. Since oxygen is the most abundant oxidant on Earth, it rapidly combines with it and releases lot of energy (it means it is set on \u2018fire\u2019) And the product of that \u2018fire\u2019 is water. When you burn paper you get ashes; but when you\u2019re burning hydrogen atoms, you get water. Since it has has already released energy during its formation it requires energy to again dissociate which it absorbs in form of heat from fire and hence acts as fire extinguisher. ",

            "answer_text": "The hydrogen and oxygen are only flammable if they are separate, and it takes just as much energy to turn water into hydrogen and oxygen as you get from combining hydrogen and oxygen (i.e. burning hydrogen). To get a burn you need three things: Fuel. Something that combines with oxygen in a way that releases energy.Oxygen.The temperature of the fuel must be high enough to trigger it\u2019s reaction with oxygen.When you add water, you are putting water between the fuel and oxygen, preventing the reaction. You are also cooling the fuel. The fires energy goes into heating and boiling the water instead of igniting more fuel. ",

            "answer_text": "The separate components of a given compound are often irrelevant t how that compound behaves or what it might be used for. For another everyday example, consider the following. Chlorine is a highly poisonous gas, while sodium is a very reactive metal that will literally cause an explosion if dropped into water. Yet the two together - sodium chloride - become ordinary table salt, without which we can\u2019t survive for long. In the case of water, the hydrogen and oxygen are fairly tightly bound together, and simply exposing water to a fire isn\u2019t going to break that bond and free the flammable gases. And since it doesn\u2019t provide more fuel for the fire, water is able to smother the fire and put it out. ",

Combine that with a relatively long range of temperatures when the water will stay liquid, you get a good heat sink to put out the fire. To the other part of the question about both Hydrogen and Oxygen being highly reactive, water is what you get when they've reacted, and that causes it to be non reactive. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Oxygen is not flammable except in fluorine. Hydrogen is combustible. Oxygen supports combustion. But when hydrogen and oxygen are chemically combined as water, the water does not behave as the elements did. That\u2019s a fundamental concept of chemistry. Water usually works because it lowers the temperature of what is burning to the point where combustion no longer occurs. It can also work, because the fog of water droplets helps displace air which limits the oxygen that can support combustion. Of course, water doesn\u2019t work on every kind of fire. A classic example is spraying water on burning magnesium. The temperature is high enough to decompose the water back into the elements and then the hydrogen is burning as well as the magnesium. This is why firefighters go to school to learn about extinguishing fires. ",

As a relevant addition though, it's worth pointing out that it is possible to split water back into it's constituent elements of oxygen and hydrogen, these will then burn. This can be achieved by suddenly exposing water to temperatures in excess of 500 degrees Celsius. This can be a problem for firefighters trying to suppress certain chemical or metal fires where the temperatures can be an excess of 500 degrees, any water they spray on the fire can actually be split and then further fuel the fire.
