            "answer_text": "Serendipity of Electron shell configurations. You see, electrons are funny things they are highly introvert, very lazy, and quite OCD about having their orbits occupied by exactly 2 electrons. I won't get too far into the electron shell theory here, but let's just say that orbitals are places where electrons stay in relation to the nucleus. They Start with 1s orbital, then 2s then 2p. S orbitals have two slots for electrons, P orbitals have 6. So now let's look at Hydrogen. It has only 1 electron. Remember how I said electrons like to pair up and they're lazy? This is an easy way saying that they go into the lowest energy orbits first. The 1s orbital. But Hydogen\u2019s electron wants a friend to share it's orbital. As it happens. Oxygen with its 8 electrons has a similar problem. 2 electrons fill each of the 1s and 2s orbitals. In the 2p, there are three orbits one gets two electrons, and two orbits get one each. The single electrons in the P orbital, also want a roommate, So when a Hydrogen mosey\u2019s by, the electron from Hydrogen has a potential to jump ship to the Oxygen. When this happens, however, Hydrogen (now just a positive proton) is attracted to Oxygens electronegativity like a magnet (literally). Each atoms lone electron helps complete the others shell. As there are two lone shells on Oxygen, it needs two Hydrogen\u2019s to complete it. This sharing of electrons is called a Chemical bond. The degree to which each atoms electron spends the majority of its time with the other atom is a measure of its covalence. When S orbits combine with P it causes Orbital hybridisation ",
