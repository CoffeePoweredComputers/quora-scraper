            "answer_text": "This answer is going to take a while. There are a lot of elements. The first thing you\u2019ll want to do is get some glass tubing and learn to make and seal ampoules. It\u2019s possible to buy pre-formed ampoules, but making your own is cheap and educational. Note on sealing gasses: It\u2019s easy to hurt yourself when sealing gasses in closed tubes. Adding heat will cause the pressure of the gas to increase, possibly causing an explosion. Ampoules used for Gasses should be extremely heavy, and handled with extreme care. Hydrogen - Make an electrolysis apparatus to split water into Hydrogen and Oxygen. Trap each gas in a long glass tube. The tube with more gas is Hydrogen. Helium - Captured from a child's balloon (this source will likely be diluted with Atmospheric air). Lithium - Disassemble an Energizer Ultimate Lithium Battery. The lithium is in a long sheet. It will corrode very rapidly in air, so put the sample in mineral oil quickly to help keep it shiny. Beryllium - no common elemental sources known. Beryllium Copper is a rarely used metal alloy (dust/inhalation hazard) that may be an acceptable substitute. boron - Can be isolated from boric acid insecticide. YouTube video by MrHomeScientist explains the process. Carbon - Wrap bread in aluminum foil. Bake in an oven for many hours. Alternate: Diamonds Nitrogen - Seal a very small quantity of liquid nitrogen in a high pressure ampoule. Oxygen - See Hydrogen. The tube with less gas is Oxygen. Fluorine - Exceptionally dangerous, and reacts with water to form glass-eating hydrofluoric acid. Not recommended. Neon - Small red light-emitting neon lamps are a good source for this. Sodium - Available commercially, or by electrolysis of salt or Lye in a mercury cell. Reacts explosively with water and corrodes in air. Put the sample in mineral oil quickly to help keep it shiny. Magnesium - Commonly available via eBay as Mg strips. Aluminum - Aluminum Foil Silicon - Silica Gel (Silicone Dioxide) is an easy source. For elemental silicon, the Silica gel can be powdered and reduced (in a giant shower of sparks and flame) with lithium or magnesium, then the resulting LiO or MgO dissolved in a strong acid. Phosphorous - Highly reactive and difficult to produce in elemental form. It can be isolated from bone ash. Wikipedia describes the process. Sulfur - Available as a garden fertilizer. I extracted and recrystallized my sample with Xylene as a solvent. Chlorine - Gas, Inhalation, skin, and eye hazard, not recommended. Can be produced by electrolysis of salt or misuse of bleach or common pool supplies. I \u201cscooped\u201d my impure sample out of the yellow-green haze trapped in a plastic bucket of pool chlorine. It\u2019s mixed with air, certainly, but I\u2019m confident there is some in the tube. Argon - Available as a welding gas or extremely patient cryogenic distillation of air. Potassium - Available commercially or by electrolysis of No-salt or Potassium Hydroxide in a mercury cell. Reacts explosively with water and corrodes rapidly in air. Put the sample in mineral oil quickly to prevent formation of KOH corrosion from atmospheric water vapor. Calcium - Limestone or Quicklime are primarily Calcium. Producing metallic Calcium is extremely difficult for a home chemist as it oxidizes rapidly in air. Scandium - No common source known. Titanium - Available as a commodity metal. My sample is a piece of Ti bar stock from OnlineMetals.com Vanadium - No common source known. Chromium - Scrape off chrome plating. This is not completely pure, as it usually contains layers of copper or nickel to help adhesion. Manganese - Extremely impure manganese dioxide can be acquired as the black powder filling in dry cell batteries. Rinsing and filtering this with water this to remove Sodium Hydroxide, and roasting it in air for a very long time to burn off the carbon yields a relatively clean sample of Manganese dioxide. This can be reduced to elemental Manganese by a thermite reaction. Iron - Commonly available as cast iron with carbon impurities. Oxidizes slowly on contact with air. Alternate source: Nails. Cobalt - Available as drill bits. Nickel - Canadian Quarters and Dimes minted from 1968\u20131999 are 99% nickel. Copper - Electrical wire Zinc - Can be extracted from current mintage US pennies by nipping the copper coating, heating to melt the zinc, and squeezing out the hot molten metal. Gallium - No common source known. Available via eBay. Alloys destructively with Aluminum. Germanium - Can be extracted in tiny quantities from Germanium diodes. Arsenic - No common easy source known. Hypothetically it could be distilled from automobile wheel weights (It\u2019s the garlic smell you smell when melting these.), but I haven\u2019t and won\u2019t try it. Selenium - Present in Selsun-Blue anti-dandruff shampoo, but I don\u2019t know how to extract it. Bromine - Gas, Inhalation, skin, and eye hazard, not recommended. Can be produced by misuse of common pool supplies. Krypton - Available commonly in some light bulbs, probably an impure source. Some compounds may be toxic to Superman. From here on out the easily available samples are few and far between. Some that I know of are: Niobium. Common as NbFe magnets. Extraction of elemental Nb is difficult. Rhodium, Palladium, Gold, Platinum, and Silver are available as bullion metal coins. Cadmium - toxic - can be extracted with difficulty from NiCad batteries. Tin can be reduced from Tin Oxide (from a pottery supply) with carbon and heat. Antimony can, hypothetically, be extracted from recovered firing range scrap bullets, but I have not succeeded in doing so. Iodine can be extracted with difficulty from Betadine, or very easily from Potassium iodide. Xenon is in some light bulbs. Tantalum is used to manufacture some, not all, capacitors. Tungsten is used for light bulb filaments and TIG welding rods. Mercury is available from tilt switches. Mercury vapor is an invisible hazard, keep this sealed in an ampoule. Lead can be extracted from lead-acid (car) batteries. It will be heavily oxidized, and can be reduced with carbon to improve yield. Bismuth can be extracted from Pepto-Bismol (it takes a LOT of PB for this) or purchased commercially. It forms intricate beautiful crystals reminiscent of temples and ziggurats. Radium can be acquired in trace amounts from antique clock hands. Confirm the presence of radium with a Geiger counter. Polonium is available in tiny amounts in anti-static brushes. Thorium is available in trace amounts in lantern mantles. Confirm the presence of Thorium with a Geiger counter. Uranium is available in trace amounts as Uranium glass or in pottery glazes. Bulk uranium is rarely available as depleted Uranium rounds. Confirm the presence of Uranium with a Geiger counter. Uranium ore is commonly available as well. Americium is available as a Gold-Americium alloy alpha-emitter source in smoke detectors. Disassembling smoke detectors to acquire this pellet is not recommended. HTH. ",

            "answer_text": "Your collection will never be complete because there are a number of elements which you can not keep as they are radioactive and they will kill you. also a number of elements like Francium etc exist in nature in less than 1 gram amount and few of them are impossible to keep as they decay or are unstable. Few elements have been prepared in laboratories for a fraction of seconds only. ",
