            "answer_text": "In Nuclear fusion, two or more lighter nuclei fuse together to form heavier nucleus and energy is released. As we know all nucleus are positively charge, they repeal each other. To overcome the repulsion we need high temperature so that two nucleus can fuse together. Such high temperatures can be created only with a nuclear fission reaction. Thus we need to do fission reaction in order to carryout an fusion reaction. ",

            "answer_text": "Primarily, the ignition and burning of fusion fuel require high temperatures and pressures to contain the fuel while it \u201cburns\u201d. This cannot be attained in any other way than the use of a fission device to supply the radiation and neutrons to start the reaction. Fusion reactors are a different animal; they intend to burn their fuel very slowly, so the fusion events have to be contained individually. The manners in which this is done do not allow for scaling to bomb dimensions, although research into a pure fusion weapon is ongoing. ",
