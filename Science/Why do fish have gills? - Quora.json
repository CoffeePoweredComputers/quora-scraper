            "answer_text": "Fish use their gills to extract oxygen from the water. So they need them as much as you need your lungs. The main difference between lungs and gills (other than water vs. air) is that lungs are tidal - air flows in one way, and back out the other way. With gills, water flows in through the mouth, over the gills, and is expelled through the gill slits. Because water is heavier, this is more efficient, as the water can just move in one direction. It also allows fish to extract a greater proportion of the oxygen from the water, because the concentration of oxygen is much lower than in air. ",

            "answer_text": "fishes depend upon oxygen dissolved in water for breathing. since the amount of this dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared to the amount of oxygen in air, the rate of breathing in aquatic organisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms. due to this reason, they are provided with gills as they help in taking dissolved oxygen and support faster rate of breathing.
