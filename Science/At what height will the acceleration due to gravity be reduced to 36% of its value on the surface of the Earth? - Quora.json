            "answer_text": "The acceleration of free fall due to gravity can be mathematically worked out as follows : mg = GMm/R^2, where mg is the weight of the object which is the same as the force on the object due to gravity. So solving for g gives : g = GM/R^2. This shows you that as R increases or the distance between the object and earth's center of gravity, the value of g will go down inversely to the second power of the distance ! Now if the acceleration due to gravity at a certain height above the earth were to be 36% of g or 0.36g, then the new R'(Radius plus height) can be mathematically worked out as follows :\u2014 With the use of the equation R = (GM/g)^1/2. So now let's get the ratio of R when a is g, and R' when a is 0.36g. This goes as follows : R/R' = {(GM/g)^1/2}/{(GM/0.36g)^1/2). Here, then (R/R')^2= (GM/g)/(GM/0.36g) = 0.36, where (GM/g) cancels out, which leads to (R/R')^2 = 0.36, which leads to R/R' = 0.6, So R = 0.6R', or flipping it R' = 5/3 R. Earth's average radius is 6,367 km, hence R' = 10,612 km, hence the height on top of the earth's surface will be R' - R which will give you the height of 4,245 km above the earth. Kaiser T, MD. ",

Solving generally, with q=0.36q=0.36 to be inserted later: (RR+h)2=q(RR+h)2=q 1+hR=q\u22120.51+hR=q\u22120.5 h=R(q\u22120.5\u22121)h=R(q\u22120.5\u22121) Plugging in R=6400R=6400 km and q=0.36q=0.36, we get: h=6400\u00d7(1/0.6\u22121)=6400\u00d70.6666667\u22484267h=6400\u00d7(1/0.6\u22121)=6400\u00d70.6666667\u22484267 km. Note that physically, this only make sense if you have h>0h>0 i.e., q<1q<1. If we go beneath Earth's surface, we \u201cgain\u201d in decreasing the distance to the center, but we lose more by losing mass that is no longer attracting us. (late edit:) What about the case when q=1\u2212\u03b1q=1\u2212\u03b1, where \u03b1\u03b1 is small? The first order Taylor expansion gives us: h\u2248R\u03b12h\u2248R\u03b12 So for example, if we want gravity to be reduced to 90% its value, we have \u03b1=0.1\u03b1=0.1 so h\u22480.05Rh\u22480.05R. This factor 22 (gaining a factor of 2 in terms of drop in gravity compared to the gain in altitude) is to be expected, since the original function was quadratic - its derivative was (normalized w.r.t. everything) equal to 2.

Putting R= 6400 km, we have, 1+(h/6400)]=1.667 OR h/6400=0.667 OR h=6400x0.667=4269 km This is the answer if value of g becomes 36% of g on the surface of the earth. Now, if g reduces BY 36%, then, g(h)/g(e)=0.64. In this case equation (1) will become 0.64=1/[1+(h/R)]^2. Taking square root on both sides, 0.8=1/[1+(h/R)] OR 0.8[1+h/R]=1 OR 1+(h/R)=1.25 OR h/R=0.25 OR h=0.25R. But, R= 6400km. Then, h=1600 km. ",

GM/(R+h)^2=(0.36)(GM/R^2) R^2/(R+h)^2 = 0.36 ( taking sq .root both side) R/(R+h)=0.6 R=0.6R+0.6h 0.6h=0.4R h=2/3(R) Where R( radius of earth is 6400 KM) so , h=4266.66 KM Above 4266.66 KM value of g will reduced to it's 36% .

            "answer_text": "r is the radius of earth . You want to know what height above earth is 0.36g, call this height h. Using newtons inverse square law F=GMm/r^2, we can derive h = 2r/3 where h is the height above earth surface at which gravity is 36% that of gravity on the surface. (I assume you just want the answer and not a full derivation) r (radius of earth) is 6371km, so using h = 2r/3 we get an altitude of 4,247km. So that is your answer. Gravity at that altitude is 36% of that on the surface. Just for perspective, the space station orbits at 408km, the gravity due to earth is 88.4% and the moon is 384,400 km away and earth's gravity there is about 0.03% of that on the earth's surface. Which isn't a lot, but when combined with the moons gravity is enough to keep it in orbit around the earth. Hope that helps ",

Use Newton's universal gravitation F = (G*M*m)/(r^2) F is force due to gravity, M is earth mass, m is the other mass, r is the distance from the center is mass, and G is Newton's universal gravitational constant. But F = 0.36*m*g and r = R + h R is earth radius, h is height above the earth, g is acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the earth. Substitute back in 0.36 * m * g= (G * M * m)/(R + h)^2 Solving for h yields the formula h = (1 / R) * [ (G * M) / (0.36 * g) ] ^ (1 / 2) Plug and chug to get the number and remember to label the units or it's meaningless ;) ",
