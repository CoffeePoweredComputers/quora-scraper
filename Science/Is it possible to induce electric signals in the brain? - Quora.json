Transcranial magnetic stimulation - Wikipedia Just know that even at relatively high intensities and with coils with the right geometry (H coil or double cone), you usually can\u2019t stimulate structures deeper than 4\u20135 cm. If you\u2019re thinking of brain hacking you\u2019re maybe thinking of Transcranial direct-current stimulation - Wikipedia instead. It does not induce electrical signals in the brain in the same sense as TMS does, and it has not been proven to potentiate cognitive abilities, sadly ",

It isn't really used to enhance (perfectly good) cognitive performance, so you're essentially wasting your time. ",
