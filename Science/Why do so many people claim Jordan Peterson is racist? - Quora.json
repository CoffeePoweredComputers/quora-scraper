            "answer_text": "Because he says a lot of racist shit. On White Privilege: He claims white privilege isn\u2019t real, instead reframing it as \u201cmajority privilege\u201d totally oblivious to why \u201cthe majority\u201d being white isn\u2019t somehow socially constructed.He really hates Communism: This might not be racist per se, but it was not uncommon in the 1960s to infer blacks, in particular, were secret communists and therefore part of a secret cabal. There\u2019s also his use of the term \u201cCultural Marxist\u201d which just means a bunch of minorities who secretly want to overthrow the west - not a whole lot of subtly there. He really hates Postmodernism: One of the big achievements of Postmodernism - or at least one of the things it would probably claim - is giving voice to the voiceless since a lot of the deconstructionism in postmodernism focuses around how certain societal constructions values certain people (things, philosophies, forms of art) over others.He talks a lot about \u2018Traditional Modes of Being\u2019: Much like the phrase \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d might not be specifically about race it harkens back to a time when things were not so great if you were not straight, white, Christian and male (or trying to pass as such). He certainly seems to think there are traditional ways of behaving that are \u201cmore valuable\u201d than others. He doesn\u2019t let the cat out of the bag as much as Owen Benjamin (who said he wanted all his friends to be \u201cabove 6 feet\u201d \u201cwhite and male\u201d but they could \u201covercome\u201d the \u201cshortcomings\u201d of not being those things).His friends: Owen Benjamin\u2019s comments got him blacklisted from the IDW, but it was hardly a shock that he believes those things. In addition to Benjamin, Peterson has been associated with Ben Shapiro (who is just racist), Stefan Molyneux (a white nationalist), Sargon of Akkad (an idiot), Steven Crowder (a \u201ccomedian\u201d who loves racist caricatures a bit too much), Charles Murray (author of The Bell Curve), Douglas Murray (he\u2019s racist as heck), among many other questionable figures. Maybe having black friends isn\u2019t a defense against racism, but having a bunch of racist friends doesn\u2019t help your case.His pseudoscientific obsessions with IQ: Not only does he quote a bunch of discredited science and make dubious statements about IQ being immutable and \u201cthe most important determining factor\u201d - but he likes to tie it to race and never does to due diligence to properly correlate the two.He downplays the racism of Hitler: He has a strange fascination with Nazis and usually rationalizes a lot of their beliefs - also making strange errors like claiming \u201cHitler should\u2019ve enslaved the Jews and the Gypsies and made them work for the glorious good of the fourth - er, third Reich\u201d (which Hitler did). He often insinuates Hitler had OCD and just wanted to \u201cclean up\u201d, talks about how he was a war hero (highly debatable) and that his racism was more or less an accident and not a feature of his personality from a very early age (which it was). He also thinks Hitler was a genius, contrary to all historical evidence which shows he was an emotional little turd who consulted the occult and made really bad military decisions.Overall, I\u2019d say his racism is more of a lack of empathy in regards to people who are not exclusively like him. He worries a lot about \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d being eroded away by \u201cequality of outcome\u201d. He never outright states, but very much implies that \u201cequality of opportunity\u201d is close to if not a complete reality - and just seems unwilling to listen to anyone (usually minorities) who claim otherwise just dismissing their claims and smearing them as \u201ccultural Marxists\u201d. One reason I don\u2019t focus much of Peterson as a racist is I find it takes a backseat to his far more obvious sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. One time Chapo Trap House referred to a discussion between him and Sam Harris as a sitdown between my \u201cTransphobic Dad\u201d and my \u201cIslamophobic Dad\u201d which I thought was funny. Peterson, being Canadian, doesn\u2019t exactly have the cultural background to become as ensconced in the racism that underscores American life - so I find him more oblivious to those realities than actively trying to perpetuate them (like Ben Shapiro and others).

            "answer_text": "I was going to leave on Michael\u2019s post, but I figured that my comment would be long enough to make a completely separate one. To Michael\u2019s first point on white privilege, Jordan Peterson\u2019s main point when it comes to white privilege is that he doesn\u2019t see how the phrase makes anything better; supposing that white privilege does exist, and I\u2019ll acknowledge the possibility of the reality that it does, what can a white man do to rectify situation. Should we institute a reparations tax on people who had nothing to do with slavery or Jim Crow? And if we should, how much exactly should we tax them? The exactly portion matter, if you\u2019re going to say that someone\u2019s success in life is due to their race, then you better have a good solution. The idea that an entire racial group has to pay, whether in actual reparations or in some kind of social deferment to other races, is appalling. The equivalent would be a white man that punishes a black man because his daughter was raped by another black man (in this scenario we\u2019ll assume that she was raped because of her skin color). The issue with racism isn\u2019t that \u201cwhite people\u201d are racist, it\u2019s that people who are white are racist (in that individual people of that race have racial prejudice). Now onto Communism, Jordan Peterson\u2019s hatred of communism has nothing to do with conspiratorial ideas that black people were aiding the Communists during the Cold War. First of all that idea is distinctly American, and he\u2019s obviously not American, but second of all that idea doesn\u2019t even have a whole lot of traction nowadays. In his criticism of Postmodernism Jordan Peterson says one very important thing, \u201cthey\u2019re technically right\u201d. There are a finite amount of things to interpret, but there are an infinite amount of ways to interpret them. Peterson\u2019s point is that you can\u2019t function in a world without valuing certain things over others. For example, a parent that saw no difference between their kid and a stranger\u2019s kid would be a fundamentally bad parent; but, under our legal system, all kids hold the same value (in principle). I don\u2019t think that Peterson would have much issue with Postmodernism if not for the fact that it does get coupled with Marxism; the coupling of the two, while they are contradictory of each other, seems inevitable because Marxism lays out the tenet that the result of hierarchies are due to a power struggle (which makes sense to a postmodernist because there\u2019s no reason that one belief structure should be inherently better than another, after all there are an infinite amount of ways to interpret things). I don\u2019t believe that Jordan Peterson\u2019s respect for tradition and the slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d are even remotely comparable. Trumps use of MAGA is meant to rally his followers behind him by saying, \u201cthings used to be great here and now you\u2019re all losing because of (insert whatever group he\u2019s against for the day)\u201d. MAGA is inherently against Peterson\u2019s belief system because it puts the emphasis on group identity, as opposed to the individual, and it gives the credit of history to the people of today. Jordan Peterson point is: that we have belief structures, it\u2019s impossible not to have belief structures, if we try to rid ourselves of belief structure something worse might take its place, we can\u2019t create belief structure like Nietzsche thought we could, so we must follow Jung\u2019s model for incorporating old belief structures into our life so that we have the best belief structure possible. The difficult with this idea is that it\u2019s harder to anchor a belief system based on a thousand religions than it is for to anchor it on one (which is why he supports Christianity, though there are other religions that led to its emergence, because he knows that this idea will be harder for most people). As far as his \u201cracist friends\u201d I\u2019d be very careful to group them all together; I think you should also be careful not to confuse friends with those he\u2019s associated with. And even if you\u2019re friends with somebody, it doesn\u2019t mean you support everything they\u2019ve done or will do. For example, Joe Biden and Lindsey Graham were \u201cgreat friends\u201d, Lindsey Graham called Biden \u201cas fine of a man as God has created\u201d, and said \u201cIf you can\u2019t admire Joe Biden as a person, then you got a problem\u201d. Just because Biden and Graham were friends, doesn\u2019t mean that they agreed with each other on everything, or even most things. It\u2019s possible to have a racist friend, without being racist. To use a hypothetical, there\u2019s a man who is a great husband, a great father, and a great friend, but he doesn\u2019t think that segregation is wrong (let\u2019s assume this man is in his 80s to give him first hand experience with segregation). His racist belief doesn\u2019t change the fact that he: put two kids through college, was faithful to his wife, and was willing to come help his friend at the drop of a hat. Friends don\u2019t make you racist anymore than having black friends excludes you from being racist (as you said). When it comes to IQ there are a few things you got wrong. He has never said that IQ is immutable, he\u2019s only said that he hasn\u2019t found any research to suggest that you can increase it (which is an extremely different claim); and that claim is fairly well backed, you can increase your intelligence through education and you can even practice IQ tests to get better at them, but if you take an IQ test unrelated to the one you\u2019ve practiced then it won\u2019t do any difference. He also doesn\u2019t like talking about racial differences in IQ, which he\u2019s repeatedly said; racial discrepancy in IQ might seem inherently racist, but it isn\u2019t; if IQ tests were racially biased, then you\u2019d expect them to under-predict success for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans, and over-predict success for Asian-Americans and Jewish-Americans. But the tests don\u2019t under-predict or over-predict; you might say that the entire system is racially biased, but then you\u2019d have to explain why it favors Asian-Americans and Jewish-Americans when both groups have experienced racial discrimination. When it comes to Nazism, it\u2019s hard to find someone more educated on the topic in the psychological field (not to say that there aren\u2019t any, but that it\u2019s be hard to find them). Dr. Peterson has been lecturing on totalitarianism for around three decades, and he knows perfectly well the evils of Nazism. His comments on things such as disgust sensitivity, a very small portion of his lectures, aren\u2019t meant to justify Nazism but to help explain why it captivated so many people. He uses psychology to explain how a group of around 15,000 members, the Nazi Party when Hitler took over, somehow grew into a regime that controlled over a hundred million people and devastated most of Europe. As far as you saying that Peterson calls Hitler a genius, it\u2019s important to understand how he used the word genius. He doesn\u2019t use it with the positive connotation that some of us may use on a day to day basis, e.g. \u201cwow look at how John fixed this, he\u2019s such a genius\u201d, but that he believes that Hitler has an extremely high IQ. He uses the Nuremberg IQ testing of other Nazi officials to explain why he thinks that Hitler had a high IQ. And as Peterson repeatedly states, \u201cIQ doesn\u2019t confer wisdom or value\u201d. Now as far as why I think people think that Jordan Peterson is a racist, I\u2019ll address this to both Michael and the common man. I don\u2019t think that the people that think Jordan Peterson are racist are politically motivated or out on a vendetta. I think most of you have probably seen some of Jordan Peterson\u2019s comments and been taken aback by them. But I think if you are really willing to dedicate the time, and come into it with an open mind, you realize that Jordan Peterson is like all of us, flawed. He\u2019s not the Jesus-like figure that goes into the underworld to save young men by telling them to clean their room, but he\u2019s also not an Alt-Right Neo-Nazi that hates every group of people save straight white men. He\u2019s wrong a lot of the time, but he also has some things worth listening to; we all just need to make sure that we don\u2019t see him as the Boogeyman or as God; he\u2019s just a Canadian psychologist who: took a stand against something, became famous, monetized it, and is trying to share his life\u2019s work for the betterment of the world (which he believes he\u2019s doing).
