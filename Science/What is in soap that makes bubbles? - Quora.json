            "answer_text": "Two things: the soap itself, and the fatty acids that form when soap reacts with water. Bubble making is referred to technically as film forming.  Soaps are film formers in water, and the soap films are strengthened by the relatively small proportion of fatty acid that forms when water, acting as an acid, donates hydrogen ion to some of the soap anions.  For any given soap mixture, the ratio of anion to fatty acid determines how strong the film is, and therefore how likely a bubble is to form in the first place as well as how long the bubble lasts.  This is seen when one adjusts the pH of soap water with acid or base (alkali).  At a certain pH, the ratio of protonated to unprotonated soap makes the bubbles last the longest, and more acid or base makes the bubbles break sooner.  By using the equation pH = pKa + log10([basic form]/[acid form]) and knowing the pKa for the fatty acid in question, it can then be determined what ratio of basic (unprotonated) to acid (protonated) form makes the bubbles last longest.  I don't recall exactly, but the pH for this is somewhere around 3-4 logs above the pKa, which would mean a ratio in the neighborhood of 1,000-to-10,000:1 of soap anion to fatty acid. ",

            "answer_text": "The reason some liquids mix while others don't has to do with the polarity of the molecules. Polar molecules will make hydrogen bonds with each other, apolar molecules don't. When a polar and an apolar liquid are mixed the polar molecules will make hydrogen bonds and stick together. This will separate them from the apolar liquid. Examples of polar liquids are water and ethanol (alcohol). Oils are examples of apolar liquids. Water and alcohol mix, water and oil doesn't. So how does soap clean oils? Let's look at the molecule structure of a soap:  The left part (with all the CH2's) is apolar. It is actually similar to an oil. [1] The right part (the C=O and O-Na+) is polar (the Na+ will separate in water, leaving a very polar COO- group). The apolar part of soap will mix with apolar oil, while the polar part mixes with water.  So why does soap form bubbles? The polar parts will still try to stick together, resulting in a Micelle, shown below. The white heads are polar, the yellow tails are apolar.   Soap bubbles are bilayers (shown below, red is polar). The GIF is not showing soap though, it shows a Cell membrane. Yep, it is the same thing.   I'm not sure if this helps out your 4 year old son :) Maybe you can say it is a balloon you can make in your bath.   [1] Soap is made by cooking oil in a very basic (high pH) solution. Some students in a practical course showed that you have to be careful doing that because the oil/soap mixture can catch fire :( ",
