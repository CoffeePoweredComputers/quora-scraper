            "answer_text": "Yes & No One of the quirks of having a brain that has evolved to make rapid decisions based on very little information, is that it must generalize. The reason this happens is because it helps the organism (you) act quickly and avoid danger. There\u2019s a very interesting line I got from a book on dog behavior: Dogs are not born friendly to humans. No, that\u2019s not a misprint. Dogs are born to become friendly toward people, but this happens only if they meet friendly people while they\u2019re still tiny puppies. Bradshaw, John. Dog Sense: How the New Science of Dog Behavior Can Make You A Better Friend to Your Pet (p. 122). Basic Books. Kindle Edition. Similarly (as we are social mammals too), humans brains have the potential to develop certain prejudices if: A. They have had primarily negative experiences with certain groups of people. B. They have been indoctrinated into having a very negative view of certain people. or both. So does that mean we\u2019re instinctively racist ? No But do we have the potential to become racist ? Yes While we may not become racist, we all harbor some form of prejudice against people we consider to be \u201cothers\u201d i.e. not a member of our self-identified group (tribe as you\u2019ve put it). So while skin colour, race, apparent ethnicity or any other physical feature can become a factor for distinguishing friend from foe, they don\u2019t always manifest as racism. You can just as easily develop a prejudice towards: Vegans or conversely people who eat meat Fans of an opposing sports team Men with beards Fans of certain bands or singers Redheads aka Gingers (they\u2019re fucking evil, we all know that) And of course the other big ones like political views and religion. To conclude: Yes, Racism is one form of tribalism but our potential to develop group identities and biases can manifest in many other ways. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, in the sort of pack structure that humans have always been organized in, the \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d feeling is deeply ingrained in us. We are and often behave very much like animals. We have always feared what we do not understand Eclipses, albinism, natural calamities, diseases, death\u2026. I absolutely believe that a certain degree of mental distinction against people different from one\u2019s own kind is unavoidable. \u2026.so is short-sightedness, fever, infections, hunting for every meal, cannibalism, braving the elements, and a million other things we now control or live without. Mental distinction cannot translate into discrimination and no amount of justifying that such sentiment is natural is valid justification. Picking the sort of unnatural that we like and going back to the natural argument when we wish, makes us\u2026yup, pure hypocrites ",
