            "answer_text": "The right question is an answer, and the wrong question is the half of the answer. If Energy can never be created or destroyed, then how was it made/started? /////that was an original text of question note: texts are freely and randomly trevel from topic to topic due to moderation and the original text may be not fit the current topic question. I will be not wondered much when some time it heppened to occur in a topic like: If energizers eated to night does it make sense to destroy something?///// Look at the conditional part: If Energy can never be created or destroyed Don\u2019t you see that it means If Energy can never be made/started ? When you see, you understand that there are only two options: Energy can never be made/startedor 2. Conditional part If Energy can never be created or destroyed is wrong. Both variants are far from to be proved. Every theory begins from acsiomatic concepts. And there is only one acsiomatic concept non contradictive in itself: Energy is eternal. That is because just in a moment when you say about start you recieve a problem with a question: what was before start? The question can not be answered in terms of reality. Another words, you need in another worlds (optionaly including even the concept of a God). That means - the question is senseless. ",

            "answer_text": "Energy did not enter the universe. Universe has infinite volume. So why do you think that the energy had entered the universe(into an infinite volume) from a place that had finite volume? Although energy can neither be created nor be destroyed yet it can be converted from one form to another. Heat, light, sounds, radiations- all are forms of energy. Even mass is energy. Mass and energy are interconvertible. Think about the amount of energy the universe has in the form of mass. Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. This means that there is no other universe from which we can bring energy into our universe. Similarly we cannot dump the energy into another universe from our universe because no other universe exists. Our universe is everything. Everything is in the universe. Universe basically has energy in different forms. Whatever happens, happens in this universe only and the energy is either absorbed from this very universe or released into this universe only. Where can the energy go? Suppose in a nuclear reaction an object is completely destroyed. But the energy is always conserved. It is converted into heat and different kinds of radiation. Now, where will the heat and radiations go? You can bring a cold object to \u201cdestroy\u201d some heat but the object itself will become hot in the process. You can neither destroy nor create energy. You could do so if scientists had not considered mass and energy the same thing. But alas, they know that mass can be converted to energy. ",
