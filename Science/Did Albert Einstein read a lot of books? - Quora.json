            "answer_text": "\u201cDid Albert Einstein read a lot of books?\u201d Not sure about \u201ca lot of books,\u201d but he most certainly did read. His frustrations with at least 1 science/physics class, revolved around said class \u201cnot teaching on observations that reveal cracks in the foundations of Newton\u2019s theories.\u201d This most likely deals with the Michelson-Morley experiments of 1886, which measured the speed of light the same, no matter how the source of light moves or how one moves with respect to the source. He wrote to the \u201cAnnals de Physiks\u201d or some German physics magazine at the time with at least a name close to that. His writings were leading up to his presentation of his Theory of Special Relativity, which was delivered officially in 1905. Chances are, if he was writing such articles to them, he was also reading other articles leading up to that point and during that time span. It was as a patents\u2019 clerk (in Switzerland, I believe), that it was noted, Einstein had time to read various patents (and likely did). Given access to an array of new ideas, such likely got his wheels turning, leading to much of his work. ",
