            "answer_text": "Exoplanets as the name suggests are those planets that are external to our own solar system,i.e.,they belong to either some other star system or come under the category of rogue planets. Nearly 2000 have been confirmed till date.  Here are some interesting ones: 1.Gamma cephei Ab: This was the first extra-solar planet discovered in 1998,but could be confirmed only in 2003 with the advent of better detection techniques. 2. Kepler 186f : The first earth-sized planet discovered by kepler mission in 2014. 3. CD-35 2722b : Most massive exoplanet till date. 70 light years away from earth and some 31 times more massive than jupiter.  4. OGLE-2005-BLG 390L : Located at a staggering 21000 light yeaars away from earth and is the coolest exoplanet to date with an average temperature of 50k. 5. Fomalhaut-b : This exoplanet takes 876 years to complete one orbit around its 200 million years old parent star. Almost as massive as jupiter. 6.55 Canceri-e : The densest one till date. Has density comparable to that of lead or about 9 times that of earth. But has a year lasting just 18 hours. 7. PSR-B1620-26b: The oldest one till date,dating about 13 billion years and located in globular cluster of M4. Nicknamed as \u201cMethusuleh\u201d planet. 8. HD-189773b : Glass rains continuously that too sideways. (Image source : google) ",
