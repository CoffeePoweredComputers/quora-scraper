            "answer_text": "An atom is the most tiny and elementary particle that makes up all the materials I'm this world. An electron and a proton are subatomic particles inside an atom. Charge is something that represents the amount of energy that a particle holds and also the type of energy. For example if you consider sodium as an ion, it had a positive charge of 1 and hence its charge is said to be plus 1(or it can also be told as 1 plus). Inside an atom, the protons, the positive ones with a charge of 1.6 *10^19 are present inside the nucleus. Along with protons, there is another important subatomic particle called neutron which is neutral or in other words it doesn't have any charge. The electrons are the negative ones with a charge of 1.6 *10^-19, which revolve around the nucleus in their respective orbits. Extra information: The mass of an electron is negligible and also the proton and the electron have equal and opposite charges and hence the net effect remains neutral so as to maintain the stability of an atom. For the same stability reason, the number of protons is equal to the number of electrons in an atom. ",

They are spread around the nucleus Proton : 1. Protons are present in the nucleus of an atom. 2. Protons are positively charged. 3. The mass of a proton is approximately 1840 times as the mass of an electron. 4. They are closely bound. Charge : 1.The electrostatic charge symbolized q. 2.The charge is a characteristic of a unit of matter that expresses the extent to which it has more or fewer electrons than protons. 3.
