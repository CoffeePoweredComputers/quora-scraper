            "answer_text": "Trump cares. What he cared and cares about is being reelected. In his initial conversations back in January, he knew the pandemic was serious. He balanced the odds in terms of winning the Presidency. On the one hand, he could take a strong preventative track which would draw more attention to its spread or the other option of neglect which would satisfy many who didn\u2019t / wouldn\u2019t like the inconvenience of the preventative measures. He tried to divert responsibility by allowing states to set their own restrictions or no restrictions. What he did do was the most harmful thing he could possibly have done. He denigrated the experts. He gave his base and others a period of feel-good ignorance of the seriousness of COVID 19. It was/is a selfish politically motivated response, but what more have we come to expect from Donald J. Trump? At this point, Trump\u2019s political survival as President is what is keeping him from being indicted on numerous criminal charges ranging from abuse of power to treason. He is pulling out every dirty trick he has used so effectively in the past to steal an election, but now he is starting to panic. His rants at his rallies, in tweets, at debates, and every venue at which he appears show him for the empty suit he is. He expects his political cronies like Barr, Pompeo, and others to fall on their knives to protect him. Barr has long ago decided that his job was to protect Tump, but now even he sees the potential consequences for following Trump\u2019s baseless demands. There is a very long line of people who have worked for this wanna\u2019 be dictator who were either fired or quit for ethical reasons. The straws that Trump is continually grasping at to save his drowning presidency are his MAGA fans. Once they open their minds to the possibility that they\u2019ve been duped - even after they\u2019ve voted for him once again, will have great difficulty in showering off the stench of a President who didn\u2019t give a damn about them or the country.

            "answer_text": "This is is what is called a leading question. You need to learn how to ask a question without revealing your political stance. A less revealing way of asking this question would be, \u201cDoes Donald Trump care about COVID-19?\u201d And the answer is so obvious it makes even this way of asking absurd. Of course he cares. He stopped travel from China and Europe months before a single Democrat had any idea what was going on and what needed to be done. Biden called him a racist for stopping flights. Democrats were far more concerned about their fraudulent impeachment than they were about COVID-19. Then when they realized they were months behind in reacting to COVID-19, they ragged on Trump endlessly, as if he had done nothing, and as if they had done lots. And CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, NYT\u2026 covered for them. Trump's efforts at halting COVID-19 and producing medical equipment and drugs that will save tens of thousands of lives is well documented. Just don't waste your time going to CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, NYT\u2026 to find out. All of these entities produce \u201cnews\u201d like one would find in a socialist dictatorship. Like PRAVDA in Russia. It\u2019s state-controlled, but in this case, it\u2019s Democrat/socialist/leftist controlled. And when Democrats win power again, which will happen, the news in the U.S. will be state-controlled news. The state will run our lives. You will learn what socialists and leftist want you to learn, and no more. Leftist control of the news is one big step toward the Democrat dream of turning us into a socialist hell hole. ",
