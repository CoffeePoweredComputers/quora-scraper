            "answer_text": "The time taken to write a scientific paper greatly varies based on the personality of the first author, the type of research, the type of paper, and the field of study. Personality of the author My preferred way of operating is to sit on an idea for months, to let it stew until I think it is ready, and then I write the entire thing in a 2\u20133 day session. The prior months of mental planning allows me to have an excellent blueprint of the paper, so writing is fast and almost stream-of-consciousness. I also have data ready months before I write the paper. In graduate school, I had to have weekly slide updates, so all the data exists in my prior slides. The months of prep is only to consolidate the idea for a paper, and not for data collection. My latest paper, which will be published soon was a review article/featured article, and it involved almost 2 months of thinking and planning, after which I took two days off from work, and spent Saturday-Tuesday finishing it. So did the paper take me 2 months to write or did it take 4 days? But I know others who write papers gradually as they learn more, or who prefer to write a flurry of shorter papers etc. The type of research and type of paper I work on theory and simulation, so my papers are far more theoretical and abstract than those published by my experimental collaborators as first-author. This means that my papers are always lengthy (I can\u2019t publish letters) and have to be more focused on why things happen rather than on showing results. When I co-author papers with experimental collaborators as first-author, the papers tend to be shorter, less theoretical, and more focused on experimental equipment, methodology, and on presenting data. A lot of their work is published in shorter papers (letters) which are meant to demonstrate new experimental capabilities, results, and/or data for the community. These sorts of papers tend to written faster than theoretical papers. As you can see, writing a theoretical paper is a very different experience and needs a very different mindset from writing an experimental paper. Field of study One of my colleagues\u2019 partner is a research scientist in biotechnology, while my colleague works in the physical sciences. The process of paper review is very different in these two fields. In the physical sciences, we can control variables and experiments very precisely, because we understand things from the ground up (atoms). This is why peer-review is pretty fast and any disagreements can be sorted out based on first-principles But in the biological sciences, things are more messy. We do not understand the field bottom-up, so we use top-down approaches too. This is why peer-review often involves the reviewers asking authors to run new experiments to further support or disprove their hypothesis. Publishing a journal paper is a far more drawn out affair in this field, and the paper will be constantly modified right until acceptance. There isn\u2019t an easy and universal answer to this question, so instead you should focus on understanding the publishing culture of your research group and of your field of study. ",

            "answer_text": "It varies, and it varies a great deal.  Firstly, it depends on what type of paper the person is writing. Is it a literature review? One can hammer out a lit review fairly quickly if they know where to look for information, what they're looking for, and how to write a scientific paper (either by having written one before or by having a great advisor that can lead them through the process). If it requires original research, data has to be collected before it can be analyzed.    \"Just read through these and write your literature review. I don't see what you're complaining about.\" --many a PI Secondly, the person's expertise in a field greatly effect how quickly they can hammer out a paper. If one is truly an expert in their field, they have a good idea of where their paper is going to fit and what needs to go into it to constitute original research. I've known PIs (principal investigators, the head of a research project) that publish multiple times per month. The way they can do this that they are A) experts in their field and B) have a steady stream of data coming in, which gets me onto my third point. Thirdly, the way that data is collected greatly influences how long it takes to write a paper. The PIs a mentioned that are publishing machines do almost nothing but write papers. They oversea a team, or multiple teams, consisting of postdocs, graduate students, technicians, and undergraduates who are all collecting the data and carrying out the actual experiments. From there, they process the data (analyzing it with various statistical methods, instructing their teams to repeat experiments/procedures if necessary) and churn out papers. Now, this is the approach used in many of the \"hard\" sciences; gone are the days of a lone scientist toiling away in their laboratories in seclusion, stumbling upon eureka! moments. Group research, often involving multiple universities and dozens of teams, rules the day. I have worked in labs where only a few people were jointly collecting, analyzing, and assimilating the data into paper, and it took much longer. Hyper-specialization is more and more apparent in science and it can yield faster publications (and discoveries), as groups of people delve further and further into the minutiae of fields and push the boundaries of knowledge.    Laboratory workers or, as a PI might view them, slave labor.  Lastly, the time spent stumbling between viable research projects can vary greatly. If one has found a niche that has the potential for multiple research projects to grow out of it, the researcher can spend their whole life within that niche, exploring all of the outgrowths of that niche. Other researchers jump from topic to topic in somewhat distinct areas, for instance an ecologist looking at the role of one species on a particular environment and upon exhausting that series of exploration, move onto a different species in an entirely different environment.    \"I will find a research topic in here somewhere, sometime.\" So, all things considering, it varies with the type of paper being written (literature review, etc), the researchers knowledge of that field (expert or novice), the way in which the data is collected for the paper, and the search for a topic (which may lay write next to their previous paper or in some foreign jungle).
