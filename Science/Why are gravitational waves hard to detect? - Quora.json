            "answer_text": "GRAVITY IS THE THE GRADIENT OF ENERGY DENSITY OF SPACE CAUSED BY MASS. Gravitational waves are hard to detect because you cannot pull out hairs from a bald head. Gravitational waves are hard to detect because you cannot make the cow lay the eggs. Gravitational waves are hard to detect because there is no north to north pole. Gravitational waves are hard to detect because there are no positive integers less than 1. Gravitational waves are hard to detect because railway track never moves but train moves on railway track. Gravitational waves are hard to detect because there is no such thing as gravitational waves. There is no such things as gravitational waves, because if by any chance gravity(or space-time curvature as most people say but I do not agree with the interpretation) start waving, it will disturb the balance of the Universe to bring enormous catastrophe. There is no such things as gravitational waves, because if it starts waving then how will the photon be guided to its destination. Something that guides has to be firm to guide. A wavy guide (gravity) will confuse it's followers (photon). There is no such things as gravitational waves, gravity is just the gradient of energy density of space due to presence of mass. This is where the catch is, that we have misunderstood the gradient of energy density as space-time curvature. And if by any chance we conclude that some phenomenon like merger of BHs is producing a wave, and then we name this wave as gravitational wave since gravity has been associated with BHs, then this wave is in no way responsible for creation of gravity. It is like any other wave. Yes , we can say that collision of Black Holes have caused Fluctuation is Energy Density of Space over Large Distances , but it is in no way the space-time curvature.

            "answer_text": "Let me give you an example. The power radiated by a slowly rotating rod of Mass M and length L spinning about its center at frequency [math]\\Omega [/math]is given by [math]P_{rod} = \\frac{2G}{45c^5}M^2L^4\\Omega^6[/math] A 1kg rod of length 1m rotating at an angular velocity of 1 radian/s radiates energy in the form of gravitational waves at [math]10^{-47}[/math]ergs/s. That's incredibly small. Way smaller than anything we can detect. Even if the rod were very very large, the radiated energy would still be very small. Only when strong gravitational fields are involved can expect measureable energy to be radiated. Experimentally, this means that when you're trying to detect gravitational waves the way LIGO did (with a Michelson interferometer), the only sources of gravitational waves that emit enough energy to be detected above \"noise\" vibrations (from like seismic activity, or a train passing by, etc) are going to be sources with really strong gravitational fields. That's why LIGO needed to look at a binary black hole system to detect the waves, and still needed a very very sensitive instrument. My first paragraph is a paraphrase of Wald's General Relativity, p. 87. ",
