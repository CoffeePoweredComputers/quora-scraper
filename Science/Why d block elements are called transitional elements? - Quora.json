            "answer_text": "There are two possible reasons, both to do with how electrons are configured . 1) Alkali metals and Alkaline earth metals are called the s-block, because their valence electrons occupy the s-orbital. Non-metals(Groups III - VII) are called the p-block because their valence electrons occupy the p-orbital.  Now, take the example of a s-block element- Magnesium: the electronic configuration is 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2.after the electrons have filled the second s-orbital, they move on to the p-orbitalTake another example-Rubidium: the electronic configuration is 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6, 4s2, 3d10, 4p6, 5s1after filling the fourth s-orbital, the electrons would prefer to fill up an orbital with fewer subshells(the second p-block), but they have to move through a whole block, the d-block, thus filling the shells there as well, at the same energy level.As they have to transition through the lower energy orbitals of the d-block, the d-block elements are called transition metals. 2) D-block elements also have a unique feature: the ability of their valence electrons to occupy the inner subshells, due to an increase in the number of subshells. This allows for transitions in valency and oxidation states as valence electrons, may not always be present in the outermost orbital. Example: Fe 2+, Fe 3+Cu 1+, Cu 2+Pb 2+, Pb 4+This characteristic could also be the reason they are called transition elements. ",

            "answer_text": "Transition metals either have partially filled d orbitals or form ions that have partially filled d orbitals. Therefore the d block elements aren\u2019t all transition metals. Group 12 are excluded and group 3 almost always are as their reactivity is almost constrained to the 3+ oxidation state which has no d electrons. Thier reactivity is completely different to the transition metals. Generally transition metals make up group 4 to 11 of the periodic table, most of the d block. I believe the name comes from the change in reactivity from the left to the right hand side of the periodic table. ",
