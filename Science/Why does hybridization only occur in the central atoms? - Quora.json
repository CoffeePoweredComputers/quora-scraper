            "answer_text": "Hybridization doesn\u2019t \u201coccur.\u201d Hybridization is a model we use to describe bonding. It\u2019s sometimes convenient for us to hybridize the valence atomic orbitals of an atom. (Orbitals are, themselves, derived from a model.) The reason we only use hybridization for central atoms is that we don\u2019t need it to describe peripheral atoms. However\u2026 It is perfectly OK to say, e.g. in formaldehyde [math]\\mathrm{H_2C=O}[/math], that both the C and the O are [math]\\mathrm{sp^2}[/math] hybridized. By VSEPR both atoms are trigonal planar. But for the oxygen, it really doesn\u2019t matter much.

Also hybridization does not only occur at the central atoms, it also takes place at the peripheral atoms although theirs is of little significance with respect to the central atom, and that of the central atom is considered to be the hybridization of the entire molecule ",
