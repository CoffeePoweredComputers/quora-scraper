            "answer_text": "The combined work of Max Planck and Albert Einstein form the core of quantum physics. It was Planck, however, who started it off by introducing his \u201cquantum of action, the Planck constant (h). Einstein would later use h to calculate the energy of a photon as E(pho)=hf, wherein the energy of a photon E(pho) equals Planck\u2019s constant (h) times the photon\u2019s frequency (f). Before Einstein used Planck\u2019s constant to calculate the energy of a photon, however, Planck did something else extraordinary with it that the questioner is probably referring to. By lining up three universal constant: his Planck constant (h), the Cavendish gravitational constant (G) and the speed of light (c), Planck derived the so-called Planck units. Planck did this by \u201cdimensional analysis,\u201d a fancy way of saying that he arranged these constants and algebraically \u201ccrossed out\u201d their units until he had left over only a unit of Planck length mass and time. Anyone can look up these constants and their units and with a little patience and algebra re-derived the Planck units. (There are other Planck units but this will do). These units are highly valued (even revered) by theoretical physicists because they are said to be free of \u201carbitrariness,\u201d which means the Planck units are derived from \u201cpure\u201d constants that are natural relationships in the universe, more like pi having to do with the geometry of circles than a measured \u201cconstant,\u201d like the diameter of the Earth, for example. The Planck units started off a frenzy of calculations for all kinds of things that is not dying down among theoretical physicists (certainly this one). Just for a little housekeeping, the Planck constant (or \u201cPlanck\u2019s constant\u201d) is called \u201can action\u201d by physicists. It has the units of: h = an action = mass x length^2/time. Physicist instantly recognize the usefulness of \u201can action\u201d because the action (h) that occurs within a unit of time give the units of energy: Energy = mass x length^2/time^2 And we all know how important energy is in Physics! There will be more to come regarding the Planck units in the future!!! ",
