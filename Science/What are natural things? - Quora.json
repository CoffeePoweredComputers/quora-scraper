            "answer_text": "The word Natural comes from Latin naturalis, natura which mean nature. Thing comes from Old English and Old Norse thing meaning object, parliament, etc. In German language, Ding means \u2018thing\u2019. The parts of speech of natural are adjective and noun. The part of speech of thing is noun. Both the words carry multiplicity of meanings. A thing is that which exists or can be thought of, imagined. It signifies a living as well as a non-living creature. A possession such as land, house or any other property, personal effects and belongings is a thing. We say in speech and writing: \u201cA thing of the past\u201d . Here thing means affair, problem, circumstance , a fact. In law, it means property and in history a council. Its meaning in music is quite different. The basic meaning of natural is: relating to, produced by or according to nature, the natural world and includes human nature. In addition, it has other meanings. Natural things are all those that we, the human kind, have inherited as part of natural evolution such as: the earth and all that it contains including ourselves, the stars, the galaxies and the entire physical universe. We have no contribution to their existence. The nature\u2019s laws also are included since they exist independent of our existence and we only discover them and then put them in forms that we can understand and transmit. Natural things are things provided by or based on nature. Air and water are natural things because they are not the work of man or interfered with by humans. Lightening is natural, but not the spark produced by a high-voltage transmission line. Forest is natural, but deforestation is man-made. Magnetism is both natural and man-made. Water-fall is a natural-thing, but not a hydroelectric dam. Fusion is natural as it is the source of energy production in stars including the sun. But fusion-bomb is not natural. The rainbow is natural, but not the rainbow color produced in a prism. A piano or a lyre is not natural. Grand Canyon is natural wonder; but Chichen Itza and the Egyptian pyramids are man-made wonders. A tomb, a sanctuary, a cuisine, and any product not available in nature are not natural things. Ores are natural things, but not products obtained after reprocessing them. e.g., crude petroleum is natural, but not petrol or gas. Things which are innate or inborn are also natural. Natural things are not supernatural. They can not be termed miracles because miracle is a product of human brain and therefore is not natural. Anything we discover is natural because it is preexisting and we only find it. e.g. Australia, nuclear reaction, trees, rivers, oceans, etc. The phenomenon of atmospheric electricity is natural, but not the high-voltage spark produced in a battery. Anything we invent or innovate is artificial or man-made. Events like earthquake or a wild-fire are natural things. A thing which is not acquired and is there without affectation or without being fictitious is natural. A physical thing is a natural thing as opposed to spiritual or intellectual. When we say that Michel Angelo\u2019s painting of the Life of Jesus is natural , it means it is life-like or natural. A thing is natural if it is based on innate moral sense, reason or instinct rather than revelation. Principle of natural justice that operates in justice system is a natural thing. Natural things refer to those who are related by actual. Example: brothers and sisters, parents and children. Natural classification of plants and animals into species, as in biology, is a natural thing. Natural thing can refer to natural colour in un-dyed or unbleached fabric. Natural thing means also a thing for which someone has a natural aptitude or for which someone is a natural choice. A natural successor (father to son), a natural enemy (mongoose and snake), are all natural things. ",

            "answer_text": "As I understand the question, the questioner is asking for clarity. Let me simplify: everything is natural. By this, I mean everything in the universe will behave according to its nature as determined by it\u2019s creation history and current circumstances. One might argue for example that clear plate glass is not natural. However, to produce clear plate glass requires a mixture of compounds, whose natural behavior with the application of heat is to fuse into a clear sheet. Nothing un-natural has to occur for this transformation. One might be tempted to say that the intervention of humans makes something un-natural. But we are just as much the natural product of our creation history and current circumstances as a lightning-struck tree, or a calving glacier. We are not a separate thing from nature. Sure we walk and talk and drive cars, but again we are but a spot on the timeline of history that has allowed us to exist. A different creation history or a significant change to our current circumstances and we could cease to be. We are no less or more than nature and we, too are natural things. My challenge to you would be to be willing to adjust your worldview so that you see everything around you, everything that happens, everything that has ever been created or exists in the world today as all part of one thing that we call nature. Thank-you for the chance to clarify this point. ",
