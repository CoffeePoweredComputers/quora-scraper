            "answer_text": "Spectroscopy is the interaction of light and matter. Depending on the energy of light used, different kinds of excitations take place in the sample and this serves as a means to classify various spectroscopy techniques. IR utilities infrared radiation which causes vibrational energy changes in matter. IR provides information about the functional groups in a molecule. NMR spectroscopy uses the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance which requires the nuclei to possess spin. This technique uses the radio waves. The full extent of realization of the differences and various other subtle points should be understood in a lecture hall or obtained from a good book. ",

NMR is routinely and widely used as the preferred technique to rapidly elucidate the chemical structure of most organic compounds. NMR is a technique which exploits the magnetic properties of certain nuclei to study physical, chemical, and biological properties of matter Measures the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the radio-frequency region (~4-1100 MHz) due to changes in nuclear spin orientation in presence of magnetic field. - nuclei (instead of outer electrons) are involved in absorption process- sample needs to be placed in magnetic field to cause different energy states- different nuclei absorb at different energies (frequencies)Probe the Composition, Structure, Dynamics and Function of the Complete Range of Chemical entities: from small organic molecules to large molecular weight polymersand proteins.
