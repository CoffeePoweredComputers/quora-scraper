            "answer_text": "Will scientists ever explain how this universe came into existence? Yes! In fact many have already. One egregious example is Lawrence Krauss, whose book \"A Universe from Nothing\" is subtitled \"Why there is something rather than nothing\". Steven Hawking also explained it with his \"No-boundary Universe\". IIRC he said \"It [the universe] just is!\" Even minor scientists like Richard Dawkins have given it a shot. There are dozens of them who will be happy to tell you how the universe came into existence, in exchange for speaking fees. But why focus on scientists? Many others will do it too. Religious figures, philosophers, even celebrities and complete nonentities will tell you exactly where the universe came from, how it happened, and who or what was responsible. You don't need to pay Sam Harris $25,000 plus airfare, transportation to and from the airport, onsite meals, and 2 nights in a hotel. There are bums hanging around downtown who'll tell you how this universe came into existence for free! They will expect a couple bucks gratuity. You'd better give it to them. They might follow you along the street, complaining, if you don't. Just like Sam Harris's lawyers will, if you don't pay him. Yes, lots of scientists and other \"thinkers\" will explain how this universe came into existence. But - in case there's any misunderstanding - of course they can't do it correctly. Anyone who thinks he can answer that correctly is some kind of whack job! Stay away from them, who knows what they'll do next. No one can or ever will be able to explain where this universe came from, with any realistic hope they're right. Even Quora can't answer that question. ",

            "answer_text": "At most, science will do what it always does, which is to come up with the best testable model that fits all the data and that has explanatory power. So the most likely scenario will involve the publishing of a mathematical model created by a team of astrophysicists, mathematicians, and other egghead types in a major journal like \u201cNature\u201d or \u201cScience\u201d that explains how the universe could have come into existence. It will mostly involve dull math but there will be some little part that will be surprising, akin to Einsteins E=MC2, that the theory will be know for. It will be supported heavily by heavy computer modeling simulations [- probably farmed out for many reasons to several universities around the world. After publication, the worldwide egghead types will spend months pouring over it, probing it for weaknesses, trying to bring it down. If the model is more or less accurate, then support and applause from the scientific community will continue to grow as the model withstands test after unforeseen test. But this will not be supported by everyone. In fact, within a day or two of the publication of this incredible theory, a paper completely debunking it will be subittted to, and published on, the website of Answers in Genesis, and/or Creation Ministries International, the Institute for Creation Research, and the Discovery Institute, etc., It will be written by Dr. Blah Ph.D. whose Ph.D is either from a diploma mill or an unreleated field, like kinesiology. But Dr. Blah\u2019s job is made considerably easier in that he knew in advance that the theory was bogus. Because it contradicts the Word of God which he KNOWS is true. Not believes. KNOWS is true. So its just a matter of finding and then pointing out the obvious flaws in that \u201catheist\u201d theory, that couldn\u2019t possibly be true. It\u2019s gotta at least violate the second law of thermodynamics, a tried and trustworthy starting point of attack. This letter will give great comfort to the Faithful, who will be horribly stressed out over this atheist publication. It doesn\u2019t matter that the scientific community rips Dr. Blahs response to shreds. After all, if the MASSIVE collection of fossils and geological samples can\u2019t convince the Faithful that that Evolution is real, a set of mathematical formulas is not going to sway them about the formation of the Universe.
