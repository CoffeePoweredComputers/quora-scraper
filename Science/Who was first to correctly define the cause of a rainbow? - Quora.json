            "answer_text": "A rainbow is made up from light reflected internally in raindrops and emitted at a specific angle as illustrated in the following pic:  Over the years the theory of rainbows has developed to explained more features of rainbows such as the separation of colors and the presence of secondary rainbows that display their colors in the opposite order - caused by a double internal reflection within the raindrops. But is was the French scientist and philosopher Rene Descartes that developed the original theory for rainbows in 1637. As expected, the assumptions and approximations that Descartes made have been refined, and improved in modern times with the availability of computers. Descartes theory of course relies on the law of refraction of light, developed by Ptolemy ( 100 \u2013170 AD), the Arab mathematician Alhazen (referred to as the father of modern optics) in his book of Optics(1021), and refined by the Dutch astronomer Willebrod Snellius (1580\u20131626) from which Snell\u2019s law is named. Let me close with this wonderful pic of a double rainbow ( from M Capucci delightful article on \u201cRainbows and other eerie objects\u201d.)  Note how the colors of the secondary rainbow are reversed! ",
