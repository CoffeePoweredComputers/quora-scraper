            "answer_text": "Crystal field splitting is like octahedral splitting, tetrahedral splitting or square planar splitting. In crystal field theory ,ligands are treated as point charges . They can approach the central metal ion either along the axis or in between the axis according to which splitting of d orbitals occur. In octahedral splitting t2g will be lower in energy than eg level In case of ( Ti ( H2O)6 )^3+ The single d electron occupies an energy level 0.4\u2206o below the average energy of the d orbitals. As a result the complex is more stable. The crystal field stabilization energy ( CFSE ) is in this case 0.4\u00d7243 = 97kJ/ mole. The magnitude of \u2206o depends on three factors : The nature of the ligands.The charge on the metal ion.Whether the metal is in the first, second or third row of transition elements.",
