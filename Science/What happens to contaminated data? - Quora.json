            "answer_text": "If by \u201ccontaminated data\u201d one means errors (i.e., differences between \u2018true\u2019 and recorded values), there are at least three basic types. The first one is random error that comes from unbiased flaws in sampling, measurement, and/or recording, as well as aleatory occurrences, that are equally likely to yield under or overestimated values. These are dealt with using classical statistical techniques, including error margins, p-values, and reliability, as well as the detection of outliers. The second is \u2018innocent\u2019 biased error, where a systematic flaw affects the data in a skewed way, generating a tendency towards a predominance of under or overestimation. This can occur due to problems in the calibration of instruments, methodological mistakes, prior belief, etc. It will tend to affect the descriptive statistics more than the inferential. In this case, sometimes one can estimate the size of the bias using the results from other, more reliable, studies, and/or from the knowledge of the mechanisms and processes of the phenomena in question, and apply a correction accordingly. Such estimation and correction may follow a certain variable or set of variables according to specific patterns, as one might be able to determine the direction and level of bias in one variable as a function of others. The third type is intentional error or fraud. Here, auditing from certain agencies can help identifying when such a thing has occurred, with governance and oversight helping to prevent them from happening in the first place. Once it is determined that the data was maliciously manipulated, and in the absence of a record of the unadulterated values, the only option is discarding. ",

            "answer_text": " There is no such thing as a perfect dataset. Data can be contaminated by several processes: Contamination during data collectionContamination during data storageContamination during data retrievalContamination caused by imputationContamination caused by inherent randomnessContamination during pre-processing and analysisAlways good to try your best to reduce contamination in the data, because lots of contamination will lead to a falsified model.
