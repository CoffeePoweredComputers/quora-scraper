            "answer_text": "Some of the most common kinds of laboratory equipment can magnify, measure, ignite, weigh or hold various substances for a variety of purposes\u2026. Balance - Used for measuring mass.Ring Stand - Used to hold or clamp laboratory glassware and other equipment in place, so it does not fall down or come apart.Beaker - Used to hold, mix, and heat liquids.Scoopula - Used to transfer solids.Beaker Tongs - Used to pick up beakers.Striker - Used to light a Bunsen burner.Bunsen Burner - Frequently used as a heat source in the absence of flammable materials.Stirring Rod - Used for stirring and mixing.Buret - Used for dispensing an accurate volume of a liquid.Test Tube - Used to hold and mix liquids.Clay Triangle - Used to support a crucible during heating.Test Tube Clamp - Used to hold a test tube, particularly when hot.Crucible - Used for holding chemicals during heating to very high temperatures.Test Tube Rack - Used to hold several test tubes at one time.Erlenmeyer Flask - Used to hold and mix chemicals. The small neck is to facilitate mixing without spilling.Volumetric Pipet - Used to measure small amounts of liquid very accurately. Never pipet by mouth! Use pipetting aids.Funnel - Used to transfer liquids or fine-grained materials into containers with small openings. Also used for filtration.Wire Gauze - Used to support a container, such as a beaker, on a ring stand while it is being heated. May have a fiberglass or ceramic center.Ring Clamp - Used with a ring stand to hold glassware, such as a beaker or a funnel.",

            "answer_text": "Laboratory Tools and Apparatuses Tools include beakers, microscopes, tweezers, hot plates, lasers, volt meters, test tubes, Erlenmeyer flasks, thermometers, test tube racks, Bunsen burners, crucibles, tripods and more. They are used to measure, observe and gather data for experiments, as well as to safely perform reactions and to heat things. More advanced laboratory equipment includes items such as spectrometers, centrifuges and chromatographs. Of utmost importance are these safety tools: Eye wash: In case materials get into your eyes, use this to rinse them out.Safety shower: In case materials get onto your clothing or body, use this to rinse them off.Tools and their uses: beaker - a liquid-measuring containerburette - measures volume of solutionclay triangle - a wire frame with porcelain used to support a cruciblewire gauze - used to spread heat of a burner flametest tube - used as holder of small amount of solutionforceps - holds or pick up small objectsgraduated cylinder - measures approximate volume of liquidsgraduated pipette - measures solution volumescondenser - used in distillationcrucible - used to heat a small amount of a solid substance at a very high temperaturefunnel - used to transfer solids and liquids without spillingthermometer - measures temperaturebalance - measures mass of materialpH meter - measures acidity of solutionscentrifuge - separates materials of varying densitypipette - used to transfer measured substances into another vesseldroppers - for addition of liquids, drop by dropglass funnels - for funneling liquids from one container to another, or for filtering when equipped with filter paper.graduated cylinders - for measurement of an amount of liquid. The volume of liquid can be estimated to the nearest 0.1 mL with practice.ring stand (with rings or clamps) - for holding pieces of glassware in place.test tubes - for holding small samples or for containing small-scale reactionstest-tube holders - for holding test tubes when tubes should not be touchedtongs - similar function to forceps, but are useful for larger itemsvolumetric flasks - to measure precise volumes of liquid or to make precise dilutions.wash bottles - for dispensing small quantities of distilled water.watch glasses - for holding small samples or for covering beakers or evaporating dishes.wire gauze on a ring - supports beakers to be heated by Bunsen burners",
