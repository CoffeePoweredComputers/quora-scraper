            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t see that as being very likely, at least directly. I watched all of the Mythbusters series, but I can\u2019t recall any of them that didn\u2019t fall into the category of one of: Seeing if this thing that happened in a movie/story/historical record/urban legend can be really doneProof of an existing thing that science knew about\u201cWhat happens if we\u2026?\u201dThe Mythbusters methodology was very light and un-rigorous (at least what was shown in the episode) and typically their sample sizes were tiny. Which is OK - it is basically a light entertainment programme. However\u2026 it is very likely that a whole generation of future scientists have been inspired by the ethos of \u201cfinding stuff out\u201d, because at its heart, that\u2019s what science is. So in that arena, they have definitely had an impact. ",

            "answer_text": "Scientific questions of consequence nowadays require lots of highly trained scientists with expensive equipment and years of work to resolve. The Mythbusters didn\u2019t have any of those elements, so answering any deep science questions was not going to happen. But to their credit, they did use solid approaches to the problems they tackled. They designed experiments to prove or disprove the myth in question using good scientific methodology. Not bad for some folks who weren\u2019t trained scientists. ",
