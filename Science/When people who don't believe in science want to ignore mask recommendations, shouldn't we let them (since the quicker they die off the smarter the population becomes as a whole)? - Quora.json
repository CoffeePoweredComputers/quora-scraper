            "answer_text": "When people who don't believe in science want to ignore mask recommendations, shouldn't we let them (since the quicker they die off the smarter the population becomes as a whole)? Science? My God, the ignorance of those who believe that wearing the recommended masks provide any protection to the wearer is astonishing. Science tells us that a mask like this provides absolutely NO protection to the wearer.  Neither does this provide the wearer any protection:  The purpose of wearing such masks is to protect others from your potential COVID-19 virus\u2019s. Yes, it\u2019s utterly worthless if you don\u2019t have COVID-19 in protecting people from a virus that you don\u2019t have. It does NOTHING to protect you. People NOT wearing masks aren\u2019t going to get infected at a higher level. People wearing masks or not wearing masks among large groups that have MANY people not wearing masks are risking infection.  I\u2019ll put it simply. I\u2019ve wore the required masks to the level of what I was doing. When I was dealing with COVID-19 or COVID-19 suspected people I wore the N95\u2019s, one of the few types that do any good. But for the most part, I wear surgical masks and bandanas. I recently had a medical appointment where it was determined I didn\u2019t have COVID-19. As I can\u2019t infect others with something I don\u2019t have, I asked what good my wearing the non N95 masks for for the last two hundred something days. As I don\u2019t have COVID-19, my wearing the masks for the last two hundred days was absolutely worthless. You can\u2019t infect a person with something you don\u2019t have. Yes, wearing any mask short of an N95 when you\u2019re not infected is that utterly stupid. ",

            "answer_text": "Science has proven that masks only provide a false sense of protection. Medical experts have proven that wearing masks will not prevent you from getting the virus. A mask keeps your spit from getting on someone. But Science has proven that the virus trances in the air like aerosol spray does.and it travels much further than 6 feet. By wearing a mask you aren\u2019t stopping the aerosol spray of the virus. Think of the virus as the size of a fly. A mask would be the size of a Hurrican fence. Can you keep a fly in a fence? No. Can you prevent the virus from passing through a mask? No. There is more and more data coming out everyday showing that covid19 wasn\u2019t anything like they thought. The testing was inaccurate from the beginning. O er 90% of deaths were patients in nursing homes,were masks are worn all the time and everything is cleaned and sterilized. The deaths were age80\u201376 and all but 4% had underlying health issues and the others would have died had they gotten the flue. If you do the math, you\u2019ll find that the normal amount of deaths each year wasn\u2019t much higher this year. Plus, the number of case of covud19 is not the true number. Not everyone has been tested. Some 80% of those that did test positive, never had any symptoms. There was never any reason to shut down the country. If you think about who benefited from this, you\u2019ll find several big companies were going bankrupt, but covid19 created work that saved them from bankruptcy. There were many manufactures making millions of masks and PPEs. Online sales increased considerably. There are many mort positive outcomes from this blown out of proportion virus. What has me concerned the most is the way the democrats used covud19 as another opportunity to attempt to discredit the president. I\u2019d hate to find out that covid19 was deliberately exaggerated just to gain more votes. But I\u2019m afraid it was. ",
