            "answer_text": "As per evolution for a new species to evolve, a randomn mutation should happen. Please carefully see the adjective randomn. Also this mutation should be a beneficial one for the species. That means it should be beneficial for it to survive in that environment. That is called survival of the fittest. Here fit does not mean strong, but fit for that environment. Now, see a random, beneficial mutation could only help a new species to evolve. So for one species to evolve, nobody knows how much time it takes as evolution is a blind process. Now if you just want to know, humans, with the present brain system is 2 lakh years old. We started agriculture and got settled around 10000 years ago. So 10000 years is a very small span in evolutionary time scale. ",

            "answer_text": "Speciation is about reproductive isolation. And the time it takes in years depends on the time of the reproductive cycle of the species. When Neanderthals encountered H. sapiens at the end of the Pleistociene they had been reproductivly separated for some 400,000 years. They were nevertheless able to complete some viable matings with H. sapiens groups. ",
