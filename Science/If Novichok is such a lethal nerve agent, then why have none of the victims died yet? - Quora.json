            "answer_text": "Nerve gas of most kinds are very dangerous, even at smal doses, 10\u201330 milligrams is enough to kill a person if inhaled. The time it takes to die is often exaggerated though. If the the Skripals were subjected to the poison through the skin an effect might not have shown up for hours, as opposed to inhaled. If inhaled, symptoms will start showing very soon, maybe within seconds, but death is roughly 10-15 minutes away. Since most nerve gases attack your breathing, efficient first aid, say a well trained police officer, and quick response by qualified paramedics and swift transport to a modern hospital might negate the effect of the gas. In a mass casualty situation, like in a Iraqi city habited by Kurds, there isn\u2019t enough paramedics to help everyone. The gas in question might be more lethal, but since only two or three people got the full effect, resources were plenty to go around. The gas still attacks your ability to breath so it\u2019s treated the same way. Atropine is used in many other medical cases and already the paramedics might have been equipped with it. The main property of \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043e\u0301\u043a is that it\u2019s undetectable with standard NATO tests up until the 80s and binary, making it far safer to transport. ",

            "answer_text": "Dawn Sturgess, a mother of 3, just died today. The U.K. police confirmed on Wednesday that she was exposed to the same novichok agent that was smeared on the doorknob of Sergei and Yulia Skripal\u2019s house in Salisbury. Apparently she touched some \u201ccontaminated item\u201d with her hands, somewhere in the town of Amesbury. The U.K. police have not identified what this \u201citem\u201d is, and are looking for it by retracing her steps from eight days ago. It could be something like a doorknob, a toilet seat, a park bench, a garbage can, an ATM machine\u2026 who knows. Novichok is not as easy to detect as the polonium that was used to assassinate Alexander Litvinenko. In that case authorities were able to trace the trails of his idiotic assassins Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun as they tracked the stuff all around London, wiping it up with paper towels as it leaked from its container. Novichok was invented to circumvent the Chemical Weapons Treaty. It was engineered to be undetectable by standard detection equipment and to defeat standard chemical protective gear. If you live anywhere near Salisbury or Amesbury\u2026 try not to touch anything. ",
