            "answer_text": "Because it not only requires the latest scientific research on human relations and psychological disturbances but also a deep sensitivity to the nuances of the holistic and largely right brain, aspects of human behaviour in the patient and the therapist. This sense, in the therapist requires something that cannot be easily expressible in words. Not being able to be expressed in words is a characteristic of the arts. It\u2019s perhaps an art to do this and that\u2019s perhaps why some people regard counselling as an art and a science? johnrossmcglade.wordpress.com ",

            "answer_text": "Counselling is a science as you try to configure a person\u2019s psychological scenario. Counsellors have to ask them things which hits the brain of the people. It sounds easy but it is not. Many times people are not comfortable with the counsellor so counsellor have to play some psychological tricks. I won\u2019t go to deep but this is the basic thing. Now what make it scientific is things like nerves, brain etc. But if we neglect them we can see it\u2019s an art. Like you should be able to make someone comfortable and make him tell his/her problem. There is a way to speak which will impact the person. ",
