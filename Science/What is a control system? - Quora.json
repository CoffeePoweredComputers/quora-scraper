            "answer_text": "A control system is a collection of devices which function collectively to drive things in a desired direction, either from external input or sensed conditions. An example most people are familiar with is that of the cruise control system in cars. The cruise control system uses a control input from the driver (desired speed) and a sensor (current speed) to drive the actual speed towards that desired speed in a (hopefully) controlled manner. Anither biological control system is that of the brain and inner ear to provide balance. The inner ear has a collection of sensors, cilia, or hairs, inside the cochlea. The cochlea then has fluid inside of it. The purpose of this is so that the haurs can very precisely determine how the fluid sloshes as you move, or which direction it is flowing. This gives the brain an ability to sense how it is accelerating, and it can then respond by sending control signals to muscles to contract or relax, in order to stand upright, dance, walk, or spin around like so gymnast or other. The commonality between these systems is there is a desired output which can be controlled by actuators. An engine, and muscles. These actuators are driven to actuate (and by how much) by a controller (the brain, cruise control), which uses sensors to determine what needs to occur to make the current state of things more like the desired state of things.

            "answer_text": "The question is tagged \u201cRevision Control (software)\u201d and \u201cControl Engineering\u201d. Revision control and control engineering have nothing to do with each other, so probably the answer needed here is to explain the difference. Revision Control in software is using software tools to keep track of different version of software source code (and other important artifacts, such as images for the UI, etc.). These software tools keep track of who made what changes, allow you to revert to an earlier version, etc. They\u2019re essential for working on large projects, especially with multiple people. I don\u2019t know a good general introduction to Revision Control; the writeups tend to be focused on a specific tool. If you want to know more, I suggest starting with git: Git - Git Basics Control Engineering relates to controlling equipment and processes, to achieve some specific behavior. A simple example would be the thermostat on your home\u2019s heater or air conditioner. They can be purely mechanical \u2014 for example, when I lived on a sailboat, I had a mechanical system that kept the boat at a constant angle to the wind. A wind vane twisted a small rudder in the water which provided the force necessary to pull cables to turn the wheel to adjust the course as the wind changed. Controls can involve more complex behaviors, and involve computers \u2014 for example, a self-driving car maintaining a safe following distance from the car ahead at different speeds and different road conditions. Chemical engineering involves a lot of control systems to maintain specific conditions to achieve a desired result, but control systems are everywhere in the modern world. Control system theory gets into a lot of calculus to describe how systems behave under varying conditions, and how to best adjust the controls to keep the system in the desired state, but for simple control systems, you wouldn\u2019t even notice they\u2019re based on calculus. Your home heater, for example, heats up your house at some rate, say 0.1 degree per minute. That\u2019s a derivative \u2014 calculus, but very simple calculus. It gets more complex as the equipment and situation get more complex. If you want to take a closer look, here\u2019s an MIT Open Courseware class offered jointly by the EE/CS and Aerospace departments.
