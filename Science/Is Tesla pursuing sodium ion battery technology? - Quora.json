            "answer_text": "Most likely not, if Tesla were looking into any battery tech utilizing sodium it would likely be a Solid State battery. Tesla already has Li-ion battery that is > 2x the best energy density found in Sodium-ion batteries. And they\u2019re on a path to double that energy density, which there\u2019s no indication that Sodium-ion battery tech has had any major breakthroughs to even get to current Li-ion battery energy densities.
