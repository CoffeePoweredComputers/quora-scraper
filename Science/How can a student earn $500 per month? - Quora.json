            "answer_text": "Whether you want to pay off your credit card debt or save money for your dream vacation, we could all use a little extra cash. Of course, finding that extra money can be a challenge when you are working 40 hours a week at your full-time job. Thankfully, there are ways for you to earn an additional income while still working full-time. In fact, most side gigs can earn you an extra $500 a month easily. Here are 101 different ways for you to achieve that goal: Make extra cash at your current job Since you have a full-time job, you can use that full-time gig to your advantage. Because of the convenience of already knowing the job, you are already on site, you already have contact with the people that make decisions -- this is one of the best places to start. 1. Volunteer for overtime You\u2019ve already spent more than enough time at work, but volunteering for overtime is one of the easiest ways to earn extra money. Often the boss is relieved to have the extra help too. 2. Refer new employees Some places of business will offer a bonus if you refer a new employee. If you know someone who needs a job, take advantage of this referral program. 3. Customer referral Just like an employee referral program, some companies have a referral compensation program for bringing in new customers. 4. Do a job no one else wants Are there any tasks or projects that no one wants to be a part of? Offer to complete these unwanted assignments for a fee, of course. 5. Use the suggestion box If your employer pays for awesome suggestions, then put your thinking cap on and start filling that suggestion box. Cash in on your skills or hobbies Most of us are skilled and experienced at something -- or have an interest in another area that we don\u2019t usually get paid to do. If that\u2019s the situation, you can finally put your talents or hobbies to work if you need some additional dough. 6. Launch a blog No matter your interest or talent, you can write about it on your blog and make money by selling ads. 7. eBook publishing Another way to make extra cash through your writing is to publish eBooks in either your field of expertise or whatever you\u2019re passionate about. This goes back to #6 and you can often combine a blog and an eBook, by taking all of your blog posts and making an eBook with them. 8. Coaching or consulting If writing isn\u2019t your cup of tea, you can offer your services to individuals or businesses either in person or via Skype or Google Hangouts. Some people just need someone to help push them forward. You can be this person. 9. Public speaking If you have an inspiring story or if you have the ability to motivate others while sharing your knowledge, public speaking is a lucrative side business where you could make anywhere from a couple of hundred dollars to a couple of thousand dollars per gig. 10. Photography Do you have an eye for capturing moments? Put those skills to work and start a side gig as a photographer. Instead of trying to be a jack-of-all-trades, focus on a niche like weddings. 11. Sell pictures Another way to make cash from photography is to sell your images to sites like Shutterstock. If you are artistic and unique with your photography in any way, Shutterstock (and others) will be interested in your pictures. 12. Become a gym instructor Whether you\u2019re trained as a personal trainer, yoga instructor or weight lifter, you can find some part-time work at a local gym. Again, some people just need someone to push or encourage them to continue their workout. 13. Become an umpire/referee One umpire told Business Insider, \u201cI umpire softball/baseball games for USSSA. There\u2019s also Little League, ASA and others. I make $30 for an hour-and-10-minute game. Ten games in a weekend, and that\u2019s $300. You can also maybe pick some games up after work. It\u2019s not so bad if you, don\u2019t mind a little yapping in your ear.\u201d 14. Caddie Love golf and being outside? Caddie on the side. You\u2019d be surprised at how much money you\u2019ll be able to rake in. A good caddie is hard to find. Some golf courses make you sign up for this job. Check it out in the pro-shop. 15. DJ events If you\u2019re a music lover and have the gear, charge people for your deejaying services. 16. Run a photo booth Unlike photography, you don\u2019t need a whole lot of experience in running a photo booth. Once you get the basics, it\u2019s pretty easy and you can pocket around $1,000 per weekend if you work a couple of events. Be easy to work with, take the shots people dream of, chat with people and enjoy yourself. You\u2019ll have all the work you can stand. 17. Become a session musician Talented musicians can sit-in during concerts or recording sessions and actually get paid for their talent. Many places need rehearsal pianists and the like. Be willing to go early and stay late. 18. Write music You can offer to write and record music on sites like, Fiverr and Craigslist, or write and record something for YouTube. Nowadays, many have become famous doing this. 19. Woodworking You can turn this hobby into a nice little side business by selling your crafts on sites like Etsy or at local flea markets. Keep your ears open to what people are looking for and make the items people want. 20. Scrapbooking Here\u2019s another creative hobby that you can start cashing in on. Chron.com has simple step-by-by guides to getting this business started. Google \"scrapbook\" and see what comes up. Some people want something particular, and others don\u2019t care and will let you do what you want. Scrapbooking can be a great creative outlet too. 21. Cater If you\u2019re an excellent cook then you should start catering events on the side. Here are a few tips to getting paid along the way. You may want to sign up and work for a busy caterer for a while. This is a tough business, and you may need help. But small specialty parties like baby showers, wedding showers and graduation parties are a little more manageable. 22. Bake If you\u2019re a better baker than a chef, then start selling your baked goods, such as birthday or wedding cakes, during your spare time. I had a neighbor who sold three things: homemade bread, breadsticks and cinnamon rolls. That\u2019s it. She made a ton of money. All a person had to do was call her early in the morning for their order. This woman was able to stay home and raise four kids in style with this business. 23. Movie or TV extra If there\u2019s a major network or studio production in your town, you may be able to bring in a quick $200 per day just by being an extra. 24. Watch TV If you\u2019re a TV junkie who binge watches your favorite TV shows, then you may be able to start earning some extra money. You can download the Viggle App or become a Netflix \u2018tagger,\u2019 which has only launched in the U.K. and Ireland so far, but watch out for it in other countries soon. 25. Create or edit videos If you have the talent and equipment, you can either start creating your own YouTube videos or editing them for others. 26. Draw caricatures Artists can sell caricatures at fairs or local parks. Although, you may need to get a business license to draw at your city's parks. 27. Make jewelry There\u2019s a demand for handmade jewelry on sites like Etsy. Also, many local spas, resorts and even hair salons like to sell great jewelry. You could start by selling on consignment until they see your worth. 28. Knit or crochet There\u2019s also a market for handmade knit items on Etsy. Baby items such as a shawl or blanket sell very well. Even knitted baby clothing sells too. Listen around your office for someone who has a special person coming into their life. 29. Build websites You don\u2019t have to be an expert at web design (although that does help) to build simple websites for individuals and small businesses. You might be able to make $100 per site too. 30. Build an app If you love to code and have an awesome idea for an app, then you can absolutely cash-in on your app. 31. Social media manager If you\u2019re a social media wiz, then start charging individuals and small businesses to manage their social media accounts. 32. Repair computers If you love to fix computers, smartphones and other tech gadgets, start a small repair business. Half the time the computer just needs to be unplugged for a while. 33. Auto repair Whether it\u2019s changing oil or repainting a vehicle, put your talents (and your garage) to good use. There is also the gig of, \u201cI will take your car while you are at work and get it cleaned inside and out.\u201d 34. Tutor If you\u2019re proficient in subjects like math, science, English, history or any other academic subject, then start tutoring after work or on the weekends. Parents are overwhelmed and need help in this area. Start looking in your own neighborhood first. 35. Teach English There are plenty of people from around the world looking to learn English as a second language. You can help them out on a part-time basis. Most people only need to have you sit and speak with them or go for a walk and speak. 36. Install software If you have a knack for installing software, then reach out to local businesses who need someone to do this task for them. Many cities and local governments look for this type of part-time help. 37. Bookkeeping This isn\u2019t the most exciting side gig, but there are plenty of businesses and individuals who could use someone to keep their paperwork in order. 38. Tax preparation Everyone could use a little assistance when it comes to taxes. (Note: make sure to file a 1099 when you do this.) Some professional tax companies need seasonal help when they are in tax season. 39. Office or home organization Both busy business and home owners could hire someone to come in and organize their office or home. 40. Interior design If you have an eye for design, then spend your weekends decorating the homes of people in your neighborhood. Brainstorm and create a portfolio of ideas so you are ready to spring into action when the opportunity arises. 41. Event planning If you\u2019re organized and enjoy making plans, then start charging others to plan out the events that they don\u2019t want to, or don\u2019t have the time to. You can plan and carry out office events, mixers and marketing events -- especially on a smaller scale. It may be advisable to work under a larger planner for a while to get the hang of this job if you have not done it before. Many planners are on contract and not part of a company, and this is just the situation you want. 42. Build furniture Handmade furniture is another craft that is in high-demand, especially with millennials. Millennials are not going to be denied anything of great value. You can sell your work online on a website like Etsy, or at flea markets and maybe even local furniture stores. 43. Personal shopper Not everyone enjoys shopping. But, if you\u2019re a shopaholic, then take advantage of this and become a personal shopper for those who don\u2019t like to shop, or who don\u2019t have the time to shop. Busy executives are prime people to look at for this business. Notice the businesses which have recently popped up using this idea. Many people don\u2019t want a business person, per se to do this work, they want someone who will become their friend.
