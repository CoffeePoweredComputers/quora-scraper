            "answer_text": "It's simply because atomic number is total number of protons present in the atom whereas atomic mass is sum of neutrons and protons present in an atom . But atomic mass is not at all times double of atomic number sometimes it's more than the double of the atomic number Eg : argon( 40 = A ; 18= Z ) (A = atomic mass ,Z = atomic number ). ",
