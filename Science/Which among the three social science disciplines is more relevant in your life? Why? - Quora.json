However, a person studying would find that a study of myself and friends might prove interesting for the study of Sociology or Social Psychology, since I am a member of a small group that is neither fanatiocal nor peculiar in their beliefs or practices; and that group is Traditional Catholics, meaning those who do not incorporate the post Vatican Council II beliefs or practices common among so many Catholics today.
