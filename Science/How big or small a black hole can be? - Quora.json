            "answer_text": "Astronomers have long known about the class of the largest black holes, which they call \"supermassive\" black holes. Typically, these black holes, located at the centers of galaxies, have masses ranging between a few million and a few billion times that of our sun! A common type of black hole is produced by certain dying stars. A star with a mass greater than about 20 times the mass of our Sun may produce a black hole at the end of its life. In the normal life of a star there is a constant tug of war between gravity pulling in and pressure pushing out. Nuclear reactions in the core of the star produce enough energy and pressure to push outward. For most of a star\u2019s life, gravity and pressure balance each other exactly, and so the star is stable. However, when a star runs out of nuclear fuel, gravity gets the upper hand and the material in the core is compressed even further. The more massive the core of the star, the greater the force of gravity that compresses the material, collapsing it under its own weight. For small stars, when the nuclear fuel is exhausted and there are no more nuclear reactions to fight gravity, the repulsive forces among electrons within the star eventually create enough pressure to halt further gravitational collapse. The star then cools and dies peacefully. This type of star is called a \"white dwarf.\" When a very massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel it explodes as a supernova. The outer parts of the star are expelled violently into space, while the core completely collapses under its own weight. If the core remaining after the supernova is very massive (more than 2.5 times the mass of the Sun yup that huge!!), no known repulsive force inside a star can push back hard enough to prevent gravity from completely collapsing the core into a black hole. From the perspective of the collapsing star, the core compacts into a mathematical point with virtually zero volume, where it is said to have infinite density. This is called a singularity. Where this happens, it would require a velocity greater than the speed of light to escape the object's gravity. Since no object can reach a speed faster than light, no matter or radiation can escape. Anything, including light, that passes within the boundary of the black hole called the \"event horizon\" (like in interstellar) is trapped forever. ",

            "answer_text": "As shovik has kindly explained the entire process, I would like to take a moment of your time with my answer. Black holes are a fab topic of mine, I've loved the idea of them since watching ST: Voyager episode in which they're trapped at the event horizon, when I was about 11. A decade has passed since then, alot of process and change has been done in my personal life and in the grand scheme of things so to speak of the Universe. However, one thing that I love is that for black holes, they experience the rate of time differently than us. Much differently. A century goes by for us and the black hole hasn't even budged an eye lid. A few thousand millenia and the black hole still hasn't budged that wink. A further billion years and still yet, that eyelid ain't moving. For us, an insane, humongous and basically unimaginable long period of time must be experienced at which point that black hole has only done half a blink. Truth be told, black holes are lonely time travelers and they literally observed the whole lifecycle of the universe in a blink of their eye. Better yet, as soon as it has blinked, all the atoms of matter in the universe has radiated away. The only physical things with meaning left are black holes and time being relative, that black hole can now start to blink as much as it wants, every second for the next sextillion years if need be. Don't you see, black holes are time capsules as they keep all internal information (that being the star itself that created the BH and the supernova and all the objects that fell in) in time stasis for the next phase of the universe: Heat Death. Heat Death theory is when all matter fades away into radiation, leaving only black holes to wander the universe. And even then after even further unimaginable time periods, the black holes fade away but even this fading is slow for the singularity itself! To be more honest, nobody knows what is inside the event horizon. I would give my left hand to be thrown into a supermassive black hole. Why left hand? I cant write good with it unlike my right :-) ",

            "answer_text": "The size of a black hole depends on the size of the star. There are three sizes of black holes: The smallest of the black holes have a mass of a large mountain and a size of about an atom.The medium sized black holes usually are expected to have a mass of about 20 Sun masses and a size in the order of 30km.Super massive black holes are believed to have a mass of a few million times that of our sun and a radius of about the diameter of our solar system.You can learn more about it at https://googleweblight.com/?lite_url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-a-black-hole-58.html&ei=vgm8wg5X&lc=en-IN&s=1&m=878&host=www.google.co.in&ts=1484503918&sig=AF9NednzvJc0LENcLmr7WBJR7BdK65_ScA ",

            "answer_text": "Alright then. I would refer you to the wiki article, it's a good start. That said, black holes aren't your usual things, rather they are specific configurations of spacetime. At the heart of black holes there are singularities, and those have zero volume. For non rotating black hole it's a point, for rotating one it's a ring (still zero volume). Then again there's Schwarzschild radius, the region beyond which nothing can escape the gravity of the black hole, these can be somewhat large for supermassive black holes. ",
