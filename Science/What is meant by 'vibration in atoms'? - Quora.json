            "answer_text": "I think its just energy redistribution, especially in a molecular setting. Atomic, just one atom. Actually, in molecular and atomic vibrations I can see in cases where enough energy would have to be shed for photon emission. Someone that's a military guy correct me if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure it's EM radiation in the near-infrared that those goggles pick up. That's a superficial answer. You can determine the exact frequency of vibrations, some can be on the order of 10^29/s but my gf is glaring at me and I really don't wanna answer this anymore. It's a goid question and it looks so easy to answer till BAM, you suddenly are explaining things in abstract terms. ",

            "answer_text": "You have read about the statement that electricity is the flow of charge.Now there in lies your answer.You see the structure of a typical atom.A nucleus with elections rotating around it in external orbits. Now when you the electrodes create a strike or ignite the process.Then it's not the electron that start flowing, it's the charge or vibration.Carried from one atom to another with the help of valence electrons. They vibrate along their plane of rotation around the nucleus & the electron of the next atom receives this vibration from the former..& thus the electricity is formed.. & there is your vibration. ",

            "answer_text": "When an molecule reaches a thermally excited state it vibrates. This transfers the energy to the neighbouring molecule. In case of atoms, the electrons in the valence shell does the vibration , the energy of which is caught up by the valence electrons of the neighbouring atom, which itself starts to vibrate. And charge transfer takes place in the process.. ",

            "answer_text": "see each and every matter in the universe either it be sun or a small toy, is made up of very small particles called atoms. when heat is supplied to a matter , the atoms absorb the heat and when the heat is more than what they can with stand they start vibrating in their mean positions if heat is increased vibrations also increase and even does the space between atoms. when space between atoms increase it leads to melting or breaking. even when a matter is striked the atoms in it start vibrating to produce sound.
