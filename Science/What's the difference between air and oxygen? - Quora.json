            "answer_text": "Oxygen is a pure substance, and also an element. It is the component of air which supports combustion. Air is a mixture of gases whose second major component (21% by volume) is oxygen, next to nitrogen. Argon and carbon dioxide are other important components of air. Combustible substances like wood burn vigorously and much more brightly in pure oxygen than in air, as only one-fifth of air is composed of oxygen. Air is slightly lighter than oxygen. ",

However, it can be a completely different mixture on another planet, or in an enclosed space. Oxygen is an element, and the term is also used t refer to its chemical form, O2, hich has 2 oxygen atoms bonded to each other. It is the part of air we need to breath. ",
