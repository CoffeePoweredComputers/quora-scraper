            "answer_text": "Wisdom is a virtue that isn\u2019t innate, but can only be acquired through experience. Anyone who is interested in trying new things and reflecting on the process has the ability to gain wisdom. By learning as much as you can, analyzing your experiences and putting your knowledge to the test, you can become a wiser person. Part One of Three: Gaining Experience Edit 1 Try new things. It's hard to gain wisdom when you stay in and do the same thing day after day. You get wiser when you put yourself out there and give yourself the opportunity to learn, make mistakes and reflect on the experience. If you tend to be on the inhibited side, work on cultivating an inquisitive spirit and the willingness to put yourself in new situations.[1] Every time you experience something new, you open yourself up to the possibility of learning and getting a little wiser for having tried it. Going to places you've never been before is a great way to get some life experience. Such as booking a trip to another city, or taking a road trip to the next town over. Make an effort to eat at a restaurant that's popular with the locals, rather than going to your favorite chain. Every chance you get, choose newness over the familiar. Trying new social activities is another good way to open up your world. If you tend to spend your time watching sports, get tickets to see a play. If you're a total bookworm, you could sign up for a hiking club or join a bowling team. 2 Step out of your comfort zone. If you\u2019re afraid to do something, perhaps that\u2019s the very thing you should try to do. When you have to deal with an awkward or scary situation, you come out on the other side better equipped to handle fear the next time you face it. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, \u201cWe gain strength, and courage, and confidence by each experience in which we really stop to look fear in the face . . . we must do that which we think we cannot.\u201d For example, if you\u2019re afraid of public speaking, volunteer to give a presentation. If you dislike talking about your feelings, make an effort to have a conversation with a loved one telling the person how much you care. Ask the person how he or she feels, too. 3 Make an effort to talk to people you don\u2019t know very well. Talk to people from different backgrounds and with different perspectives from yours, and pay attention to what you can learn from them. Try not to judge them based on your own narrow point of view. The more you're able to empathize with others, the wiser you will be.[2] Practice being a good listener, and ask a lot of questions to find out more. Really pay attention to what people are saying instead of letting your mind wander. Every conversation gives you the chance to understand someone better, broaden your views and thus become wiser. Share yourself with the people you're talking to, too. Work on going deeper than casual conversation and fostering new friendships. 4 Be open-minded. Instead of judging things you don\u2019t know much about, consider them from every angle and make an effort to understand.[3] It's easy to base our views on the limited experiences we've had in life, but that's not the way to gain wisdom. You can't help that you've grown up in a certain place with certain people, but you can decide how open you are to learning about different ways of life. Don\u2019t base your opinions of things on what other people think, or whether something is popular. Do your own research and look at both sides of the story before you decide what you think about something. For example, maybe you think a certain type of music isn\u2019t cool because none of your friends like it. Before you jump on the bandwagon, try seeing a band play the music live, and read up on its history. When you've taken time to understand something, you can decide you don't like it, but not before then.

            "answer_text": " A famous philosopher has been teaching his students about politics and ethics for years. His students dislike him, since he constantly belittles their intellect and brags about his. One day, a young girl musters up the courage in class to ask him a simple question: \u201cHow does one gain wisdom?\u201d This catches the philosopher off-guard. He doesn\u2019t know what to say and tries to explain that he doesn\u2019t know the answer to her question, since he focuses on ethics and political philosophy, and not epistemology. The girl is surprised, \u201cYou brag about how smart you are and how dumb we are, but you can\u2019t answer the simple question of how one gains wisdom?!!\u201d The class bursts into laughter.  The next day, the philosopher confronts the girl, \u201cThe only reason I couldn\u2019t answer your question yesterday was because I didn\u2019t have time to think about it, otherwise the answer is simple: You gain wisdom from introspection. In fact, this is the only way to gain wisdom.\u201d The girl smirks, \u201cAre you sure? If we can only gain wisdom by thinking on our own, then why are we taking classes from you?\u201d The philosopher is speechless and the class starts to laugh at him again.  A humbled philosopher comes to class the next day and addresses the girl, \u201cI apologize for having been so arrogant over the years. I hope you can forgive me. You have taught me an important lesson: You can gain wisdom from others. \u201d The girl is pleased but decides to gloat, \u201cYou are a fool. I know far more than you ever did and should be teaching this class, since there is nothing more you can teach me.\u201d The philosopher sees his opening, \u201cReally? I was about to teach a third way to gain wisdom that neither of us has mentioned. But I guess you can tell us.\u201d The girl regrets her boast, \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201d Her classmates snicker. After an embarrassingly long pause she asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cYou can gain wisdom from experience. The experience of being embarrassed in front of this class for boastfulness has taught me humility. I hope it teaches the same to you too.\u201d  Confucius has said \u201cBy three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.\u201d There are other ways to gain wisdom too, but I think these three are a good start.
