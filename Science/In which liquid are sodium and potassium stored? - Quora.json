            "answer_text": "Sodium and Potassium are generally stored in containers containing kerosene . This is because , these elements are highly reactive when exposed to moisture because they react with H2O molecules present in air with the production of H2 . Now H2 reacts readily with O2 present in air , which is explosive . Similar reaction occures if these metals come in contact with water. So, generally it is stored in containers containing kerosene oil to avoid its interaction with moisture . ",

            "answer_text": "Sodium is highly reactive metal.Sodium reacts with oxygen in air at room temperature to form sodium oxide.Sodium reacts with water to evolve hydrogen which immediately catches fire.In ordinary air, sodium reacts with to form a Sodium Hydroxide film, which can rapidly absorb carbon dioxide, forming sodium bicarbonate.Sodium does not react with kerosene.Its density is greater than kerosene.Hence,sodium is stored under kerosene.Same goes for Potassium,it is also stored under kerosene.",
