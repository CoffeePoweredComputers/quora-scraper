            "answer_text": "For ordinary stars, I don\u2019t know exactly, but it is known to happen, at least in close globular clusters. We find here \u201cblue stragglers\u201d, stars with an abnormal age, apparently younger than the others (while all should be of the same age). It was finally understood that if was coalesced stars. So, it is known that when stars collide, they coalesce in a larger star. In very dense star populations, we can suppose they coalesce hierarchically, and this process started the central black hole of galaxies. Now how this happens exactly is not known. For stars in orbit, this has been studied, but for head-on collisions I never heard of studies or modelisation, and all the less of observations. Yet it should happen, and perhaps it is recorded as novas. In globular clusters, the relative motion of stars is slow. Still, two sars like the sun would accelerate while approaching, reaching 2x 617km/s at contact. Probably this contact is a huge explosion, with a lot of ejections. But these ejections cannot get a higher speed than the escape velocity they started from, explaining that most falls back in a new star. Probably there is an accretion disk forming new planets, while the ancient ones may survive in elliptical orbits. When stars encounter at a higher speed, the problem is more difficult, with several possible outcomes. In any case a much larger fraction of the mass should be ejected. Or the two cores may pass near each other, exchanging part of their outer layers. More probably at higher speed those outer layers are entirely stripped. Most interesting cases is when there is a huge difference of size between the two stars. If it encountered a giant star like Eta Carinae, a small system like Trappist should be entirely swallowed without the orbits of the planets being disrupted. In some cases, the coalescence may trigger a supernova, or more discrete events like an helium flash. In any case the stars are probably entirely stirred, leading to a different evolution, re-ignition of internal layers, etc. In the case where the two stars are a white dwarves, we can suppose it does a Ia supernova, two time more powerful than the usual ones. In lesser cases, or if one is an ordinary star, we too get a Ia supernova, but of more usual size. In the case of black holes, they coalesce, and this has been recently observed with gravitationnal wave events. In the case of neutron stars, this has been observed too, with the same method. But the result was a surprise: several Earth mass of the neutron matter is ejected. And, losing its stability, the neutron matter forms the heaviest nuclei: uranium, baryum, gold, and some others. To the point that most of these elements are formed this way!  In the case of a neutron star encountering an ordinary star, it will enter in. I heard some speculations about that case, where the neutron star falls to the core, or may even orbit around it for a while, inside the star. After, it is not clear: the neutron star will attract matter, but then it is so much compressed that it starts thermonuclear reactions, stopping the accretion. So this compound star should be stable like an ordinary one, although probably burning faster and more powerfully than another star of the same total mass. If a black hole is swallowed by a normal star, then things are more clear: as nothing can stop matter from entering in, the black hole will swallow the entire star. This process has been theoretized, and observed in the case of stars which core collapses in a black hole without a supernova: the star directly blacks out, in a matter of some hours! only after the end, say one day after, the accretion disk becomes visible for some hours, making a last flicker before disappearing to darkness.

            "answer_text": "There are several possibilities. If the collision speed is higher than a particular threshold speed, say about 300 miles per second, enough kinetic energy would be imparted to the two masses that the stellar material would dissipate into a vast expanding cloud of gas, never to reassemble itself into a new star. If the speed were very slow, the stars would merge into a new, more massive, star. The evolution of the new star would begin with a rejuvenated core of fresh fuel since the merging of the two stars would have mixed new hydrogen fuel into the core of the new star. If the speed of the impact is moderate and off center, the stars will go into a very tight orbit around one another, perhaps even sharing a common gaseous envelope. Over time, the two separate cores would spiral into each other, and you would again be left with one new, massive star. Since the escape velocity of the Sun is about 1.3 million miles per hour, this is about equal to the threshold speed of the impact. If a smaller star, like a white dwarf or neutron star, smashes into a bigger star, like a red giant, most of the giant's outer envelope would be blown off as it absorbs the impact. The results get a little more violent when two smaller stars collide. Neutron stars are very small and dense. If a neutron star reaches a certain mass, it will implode and form a black hole. Therefore, if two neutron stars merge but their combined mass is more than the maximum mass a single neutron star can have, they implode into a black hole. If the circumstances are the same when two white dwarf stars collide, they will implode into a neutron star. ",
