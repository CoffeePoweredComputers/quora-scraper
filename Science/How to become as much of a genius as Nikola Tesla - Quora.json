            "answer_text": "Tesla very clearly used a mental technique also employed by Edison, Picasso, Bucky Fuller and others. Their associates reported that these geniuses didn't sleep! They did sleep though, and today it's called 'Poly' or 'Polyphasic Sleep:' sleeping enormously reduced hours in the form of naps throughout the day. I've used this myself (accidentally while cramming for university exams,) and after a few weeks of it, your \"idea faucet\" turns fully on. More like the ideas-firehose. The ideas-Niagra-Falls. But to use this technique, you cannot have a normal day job, or be living with others. Most experimenters have reported that Polyphasic Sleep will screw up your life because of how others respond to it. You'll be fired; for frequently hiding out and napping at work. You'll end up divorced because every night you're up all night making noise, never in bed. Also, the Crazy Eyes. Also, Tesla very probably used a mental technique described by Henri Poincare in his \"Science and Method.\" It's a method for harnessing your own Unconscious, your Inner Savant. This is done by, first, taking very seriously all your spontaneous unconscious messages/ ideas/dreams. Write them down. Carry around a little notepad, always. When weird thoughts come to you out of nowhere, always try to record and preserve them, or at least get them into conscious memory, discarding nothing. Before getting out of bed each morning, try to recall details of one or more dreams, and perhaps write them down (perhaps keep a dream journal for a few years.) Learn meditation, existing with all your inner verbal thoughts shut down; thinking in pictures and pure concepts only. I'm convinced that normal adults treat the Unconscious channel as disgusting trash or worthless fantasy/ daydreaming, and all of us successfully suppress it. We reject our original thinking methods, leaving them behind as we grow up and learn thinking-in-words and logical reasoning. But to become a \"grownup\" is to become a non-genius. If instead we treat those thoughts/fantasies/daydreams like gold, then we reinforce the flow, and with luck open the floodgates. So, in other words, we're striving to return to our long-lost childhood mental state, living half in a daydream, with no internal verbal chatter or \"grownup\" logical thinking barriers blocking off the creative flow. Then second, after having worked on some major challenging engineering/math/scientific problem and getting nowhere ...give up. Drop the problem, unfinished. Work on something else. Go on vacation. Cease all conscious problem-solving for days or weeks. Then, as you're stepping onto a streetcar, or humming to yourself in the shower, or driving long distances in darkness ...suddenly the complete answer appears in your head, all in a flash. I've managed to do this myself several times, and the results are near-unbelievable in that it happens in an instant, yet it may involve pages and pages of new material coming \"from nowhere,\" as if I'm taking dictation. When driving at night (slipping into 'drivers trance,') I'd get a huge flash of insight and have to pull over to the side, then spend an hour getting it all down on paper. Yet it appeared as a single event, in a one-second burst, \"the light bulb\" turning on. These spontaneous 'flash of genius' solutions didn't start happening until I'd spent years learning to think in concepts rather than words, years of writing down nearly every crazy idea to pop into my head, recording dreams every morning, etc., etc. And finally, you're probably going to have to become a weirdo loner outcast. (Of course if you started out as a loner, chances are good that you'd discover all of the above techniques without help!) If you weren't an outcast-type beforehand, then a few years of the above mental practices will do it. Loved ones and co-workers, the rest of \"your tribe,\" will take your newly eccentric behavior as a descent into mental illness, rather than intentional cultivation of genius. Everyone in your life will edge away from you, since you're no longer a normal-grownup non-genius like everyone else. Obviously you've made yourself crazy, right? Turned hypomanic, possibly schitzophrenic. And everyone knows that crazy people are dangerous, THEY MIGHT DO ANYTHING ...like writing symphonies, inventing induction motors and radio, founding Cubisim, dressing shabby in coffeeshops and always scribbling scribbling scribbling dangerous ideas in their little notebooks, etc., all the sorts of stuff that deeply threatens those in power, and may at any time overturn our entire way of life. - Carl Jung, upon being asked by James Joyce to explain the difference between Joyce's mind versus that of his schizophrenic daughter, replied: \"She falls.

            "answer_text": "If you weren't born a genius (exceptionally or profoundly gifted, in the current jargon), you won't become one. User-12309717430891571750 has it quite precisely, as do Ronan Bolzer, James Pay and Anonymous.  Also, Tesla, like so many brilliant individuals, was a unique individual, with particular gifts, who happened to live at the right time and in the right place to be regarded as a 'genius' (in the cultural sense, i.e., a famous person of eminent intelligence and achievement), even though, in actuality, had he been recognized or not, he was born exceptionally or profoundly gifted -- we don't know which, because to the best of my knowledge no-one ever gave him an IQ test. Finally I wish to address Mizael Pena's comment that \"Everyone has the capacity to be a genius.\" That statement, no offence to Mr. Pena, makes about as much sense as saying \"Everyone has the capacity to be 6'10\" tall.\" No they don't, and you can only \"be\" a genius, never \"become\" a genius, just as you can only \"be\" 6'10\" tall, never \"become\" 6'10\" tall. The evidence is rather overwhelming ( http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/40459/title/inherited-intelligence/, Is genius genetic?,  A Genetic Code for Genius?, THE GENETICS OF GENIUS, Does True Genius Have a Genetic Basis? Experts Say \"Yes\" (With Possible Slightly Psychotic Side Effects).  Had Mr. Pena stated, \"Everyone has the capacity to maximize their potential and ability\", I would have agreed. But genius (or exceptional or profound giftedness) is around 55-60% genetic in nature. the influence of environment isn't to then determine who will and who won't be a  genius (or exceptionally or profoundly gifted), but rather whether or not the genes will be expressed. And barring any major catastrophe, like being locked in a  dark closet for the first 5 years of one's life, or suffering severe malnutrition, genius -- innate, inborn genius -- will appear; but if you don't have it, you ain't gonna get it.  You, specifically, the question-asker, seem highly intelligent. Whether or not you are a  a genius (or exceptionally or profoundly gifted, to use the modern terminology) can best be determined by an IQ test (see here: mensa iq test ). But neither you, nor anyone else, will ever be Nicola Tesla except Nicola Tesla. Want to be recognized? Seen as brilliant? Work hard, study hard, read a lot. play sometimes. Maybe you'll have  great inspiration (or two see here: Albert Einstein and here: What did Albert Einstein invent? ), maybe not; statistically, probably not.  But even if you don't, so what? Be the best you can be and let the rest fall into its natural order and progress. Thanks for reading this; was not an A2A. JJW ",

            "answer_text": "Meditate daily for as long as you need. Your needs are greater than you know. Go to bed with a problem and dream the answer. You will have it in the morning. This process is rarely done in one step. We have pet theories that we do not want to give up that keep us from seeing the truth. However, keep to the process and you will begin to see cracks that tell you to let them go. You have to be willing to die for the truth because otherwise you are not worthy of it.  The energetic cosmos reacts to your beliefs. You must reprogram yourself  (CDM) to never accept any other beliefs the world desires to put onto you. Accept that to be uncommitted to the worlds false beliefs means the world will make you pay an energy cost for opposing it. That is the price of doing business. Accept the costs and move on. Most people do not want the worlds extra attention for opposing it and so accept the false herd belief system unconsciously. However, if you do not pay, those false belief systems will have the power to turn your pivot slowly turning you away from the light and you will never get anywhere.  Your blocks are yourself. You have some beliefs to build a worldview on. Everyone has one and it is needed to build something with. Understand that if finding the truth is important to you, you WILL have to give up your pet theories of how things work.  You cannot be Tesla. He was his own unique man. However, you can be your own unique person. That is what you have to work with. If you are lucky, you will discover or find something that is fundamental, which will be built on by others like yourself.  In order to find that something fundamental requires you to question what established science is determined with an iron will to not change, which is their worldview. Worldviews held by establishments are not to be altered so do not try to force your better understandings on them. They will not accept it no matter the evidence or facts. If you have evidence of something that does not seem to challenge fundamentally their worldview, go for it. Otherwise forget it. Captain Nemo had it right. Just do it and go on. That is what Tesla did. He succeeded but society & business could not profit from it so they ignored him to death. Just because others will not accept the truth does not define your successes.  You have to be a Keplerian. When facts point you in a different direction you must follow it whether you like it or not. Drop the established stuff and go in the direction that observations and your gut point you to. You will be alone most likely. That is also a price that must be paid. Find individuals that are open to open minded friendship & support. You will need it.  One last. The cosmos is a higher force than yourself. You will not get anywhere if you are selfish because that is just ego that has no power to change the world. You are a spark from the Creator. That spark is as unlimited as the source. You do not have to do anything to become someone. Ego tries to do something in order to become someone.  Accept the truth of what you are and because of what you are you will perform feats that seem impossible. Nothing is impossible with the Great Creator on your side. Work for the Creator and you will never have more than one boss. Good luck ",

First off is to learn to think, which means learn to debate BOTH SIDES of an issues, any issue!

It is a success, even if I never made a penny and USA can\u2019t give me credit because they removed my human rights 10 years later in 1993. My history proves me & my intelligence\u2026 not a club membership or a school or some one else. Tesla and ANY very smart person is the same, THEY DID IT\u2026 Not taking courses to say they are, their history tells us so. Once you learn to LEARN then you can learn to follow your gut. That will take you to the source of you personal \u201cmagic\u201d formula to successful intelligence. Everyone has a package to sell. If you are as smart as \u201cA Tesla person\u201d, the sales pitch does not matter, the open mind does, the learning to LEARN does. I never wante3d to be like someone else, I needed to survive in an abusive family. 1962, at 4 years old I created a Fad in USA that lasted over 10 years. The computer punch card Christmas wreath. I went out to sell my wreaths, a joking insult by a woman and man I had to call parents. The \u201cfather\u201d watched me make as much money in 2 hours or less than he got at his Los Angeles County Job. I went on to sell those wreaths for 3 years. But I had won. I was told I had to Pay back every cent it cost to raise me, and I knew then & there, I could make monies. a 1967 newspaper article, 5 years after I created them. 2 years after I dropped out due to lack of funds to compete.

            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question for one to ask because I do not believe anyone can become a Genius. You are born this way. The abilities that Geniuses have in them are so complex that for one to try and become this way would likely end in no success or very little at best. The area of Genius  and Prodigy involves many medical factors coming together in a person that to duplicate it is next to impossible to do. There are factors that the average person could never achieve even if they tried their best. You mentioned sleep for instance or lack of it and the ability to continue to work  as anyone else would do without it. For the average person to try this is likely to end with that person being very tired and could be rather unhealthy to try in the first place. If one were to try and become a Genius this is likely to be the end result,always. One would more than not just become rather ill than become Genius. When one adds in the other areas that you mentioned here, the final result is more than not that one would be unhappy, constantly. Finally, the individual is simply going to give up on the idea all together.        Genius and Prodigy are individuals that do have a lot of the qualities that you told here in this question of yours. The isolation, hard working, lack of sleep.; it is all there. Such individuals push themselves to the edge to try and answer questions for society. With the hope of helping making this world a better place for all. And at the same time there is no garentee that they will find success either. Many persons of these abilities live in worlds that can turn out very tragically. As an example of this there is the most famous Prodigy of all times; Christ, himself. After he produced his works onto society, we all know what happen there. It is true now that he became know for his knowings throughout the world and at the same time the result was him paying for it by losing his life. He is not alone in this type of endings. Many do end in death or seriously ill due to the works they get involved in. At the same time there are successful stories that come from being known as Genius. Albert Einstien is one such ending. Though in these two cases there are many others that we do not know how they will turn out in the final conclusion. For anyone individual to have the abilities of Genius or Prodigy the ending could be one or the other. It is a risk that they must decide on, is it worth taking for thyself?       I speak in this manner because I have been label in this way over the years and it is still in me. My final end is not known yet. I still continue to work on my own body of works for the world, this is likely to continue for years to come,also. ",

            "answer_text": "I think it would be easier than many here would have you believe. I have known about 12 people in the 200 IQ range, or said they were. It is not too hard to tell those who can, and those who try. (One taught me about sleeping every 4 hours. \u201cSleep for 17 minutes.\u201d \u201cSet two clocks.\u201d My observations were a little different than what he said.) As a Tutor I teach a simple way to learn skills. If you learned each of the skills Tesla had, one by one, would that be an answer your question? If I told you about the goal of one reading program, \u201cHow to Read a Book\u201d by Mortimer Adler, where one is asked to read the Great Books from history and match your mind to the top 100 minds from history, would this exceed your goal to be \u201cas Tesla?\u201d I think every individual has two basic abilities, even Tesla, even the 99 other great minds from history. From these two abilities individuals build all the others. [None of this is genetic, none of it is chemical, none of this is environmental. This is just you observing and deciding.] Using this concept of how abilities are learned, then a unique rule becomes possible. Increasing one ability, increases all abilities. I start with the definition of Ability. I define ability as Observe, Decide, Act. When you observe a skill closely you can decide to acquire it, then act. It may be that you have not observed it fully enough, so you have to observe more, and decide again. In my case I saw my sister riding a bike, I wanted to ride a bike. I said, \u201cLet me try!\u201d She tried to \u201cteach\u201d me. She said, \u201cIf you feel you are falling to the left, steer to the right.\u201d I diligently did as I was told. I fell down painfully. So I tried again, this time I tried even harder to \u201cturn to the right\u201d if I felt I was \u201cfalling to the left.\u201d I fell again, but caught myself. I learned a lesson. My personal observations trump teaching. Now, I knew she knew how to ride a bike, but I did not learn how to ride a bike from her. I observed, I decided to acquire the ability to do it, and I did it. In this case it involved rejecting what others had said. One can observe skills from written materials, from their imaginations, and from hearing others describe the ability, such as a teacher. There are many more ways, more than the number of all your perceptions. This definition of ability comes from the two basic abilities. An individual has the ability to Observe. This could also be written as the ability to perceive, where I believe there are over 50 common human perceptions and one could observe with any one or all of them. One\u2019s memory does contain all 50 or more of these.An individual has the ability to Decide.So one could learn each of the skills Tesla had. One could learn each of the skills the 100 Great Minds from history had, with this technique. You may recognize this as the way you have learned all the skills you have acquired.

            "answer_text": "Everyone has the capacity to be a genius. You jut need to activate or trigger it. In my book I explain how this is done. Let me give you a great example of how it can be done. Today and always there has existed an organization that has been doing it successfully, the US Military. They take random people of all walks of life and they mold them into whatever it is that they need them to be. Their background varies tremendously. This system has worked for years and they keep making it happen.The process is as such, you break the individual down, remove all bad habits and irrelevant knowledge base and then build them back up by instilling useful knowledge and work ethic, you give them the ability to be successful, you set them up for success. So it is frustrating to me that other people can spread nonsense and biased information that would ever you or others from the search of higher intelligence in ones self.  So to recap: You must let go of irrelevant beliefsYou must let go of bad habits You must be open mindedYou must want success like oh want to breatheYou must have a string work ethic You can also use my system of self reprogramming with RECB Relevance, Efficiency, Consistancy, Bias R: if something does not matter and fit into your goal that you want to achieve or necessary then move on. E: do everything the best way possible, not hard, not easy, not because you want it C: you must be consistent in everything that you do no matter what.  B: leave all bias, irrelevant beliefs, and opinions alone.  So what does this system have to do with intelligence? Everything, because all we do today in our lives in real time is based on irrelevant nonsense that do nothing to get you to succeed in a my goals you might go after. ",

Learn from people you admire and allow them to be your inspiration.   Know yourself as best you can, rather than trying too hard to be someone else. So someone decided this question needs an Answer Wiki? Really? According to Quora in describing an Answer Wiki they state, \"Aggregated answers aim to be a comprehensive collection of uncontroversial, factual information.\"  So does that mean that \"Participate in Polyphasic sleep\" is \"uncontroversial, factual information\" in answering how do I become a genius?  Many successful people were compulsive in their visions and beliefs, to the point of creating health problems. Tesla had at least two nervous breakdowns in his lifetime. Maybe he should have gotten more sleep? When I was growing up I read a lot of science fiction books and stories by Isaac Asimov. As I read more and more science fiction books by Asimov, I started reading about the man himself and learned he was also a brilliant scientist. I thought this guy is a genius, I really admired him. Asimov wrote hundreds of books, science as well as science fiction. I read quite a few of his books and short stories.  Perhaps I could trace my passion for science and technology back to my reading of Asimov.  Isaac Asimov inspired me to read more, and learn more. The thought never crossed my mind how do I become more like Asimov.  ",

BUT: you would probably NOT want to be a genius like Tesla. He died lonely in his hotel room. Ok, you might already be a loner, so you might not mind, However, Tesla died also a virgin. From an evolutionary point of view, it makes no sense putting so much effort into an endeavour without increasing one's reproductive potential. In a way, it\u2019s self-actualisation gone wrong.

Focus upon as many fields related or unrelated as you can, mastering each in full, some one at a time, some collectively. Different fields overlap and breakthroughs often happen with a solution to one that can be combined and applied to the other. Do not be afraid to think completely out of the box, no matter how far fetched, often failures give you solutions to other projects you are also working upon. Strive for the impossible, perpetual motion, time travel, anti gravity, free energy, alternative ways to make something else function, merge technologies together. Understand that our currently accepted educational system will radically evolve in the future just as it has from the past. Spend time in deep contemplative thought regularly, this means no distraction from people, places or things. Never stop dreaming, exploring, researching, tinkering, experimenting. Document all results, especially when you observe the impossible that defies all logic, engineering and physical explanations. ",

If you don't understand what I'm saying to you you already suffer from lack of imagination, which Tesla used everyday when he invented. Sitting down and opening his mind and putting things together with in it. You must have a great imagination to do something like this. II in order to have imagination you must know something so go to your local library and gather all the information on the latest technology, science, Biology, math, and couple that with science fiction movies and not those fake science fiction movies but it must have real science behind it's fiction like Star Trek, these are people who imagine the future and faked it into they could bring it into fruition. That's how you become a Tesla ",

Lose interest in inventing. Type 2: Have a lot of hobby skills like electric work, designing with plastic, or building with aluminum. Make a small innovation that other \u2018experts\u2019 remember you for. Type 3: Maybe you\u2019re in it for the people or the money only, and you\u2019ve always had people or money, so that\u2019s what you get. Nothing improves, it just stays the same. Type 4: You love inventing intellectually, and don\u2019t care if your idea gets stolen. You produce so many inventions, and they are so useful, that someone eventually reconstructs one of your inventions for a useful purpose, and you get intellectual credit, perhaps but not always after you\u2019re dead.

Geniuses haven't wanted, haven't tried to be geniuses, they just are in adequacy with themselves and circumstances they live in. Sometimes they inspire us, but they don't make us geniuses.
