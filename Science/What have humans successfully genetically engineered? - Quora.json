Herbicide r\u00e9sistant corn, soy and canola that allow easier weed control with more benign herbicides with less fuel required. Insect resistant corn, cotton, and eggplant that need little or no spraying of hazardous chemicals. Disease-resistant papaya, potato and bananas. Salmon that grow to market weight in less time using less feed. Rice and bananas with better nutrition such as vitamin A. Of course, these are just some of the crops created with a type of genetic engineering called transgenesis. There are other genetic engineering techniques out there such as mutagenesis (been around for decades) and newer ones such as RNAi and CRISPR. ",
