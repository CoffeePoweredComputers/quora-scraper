The Flynn effect simply underscores just how useless and ineffective IQ tests and IQ scores are as a method of measuring \u201cintelligence\u201d IQ tests are not even a good way of measuring your ability to do IQ tests!

            "answer_text": "I beg to disagree. Flynn effect cannot raise IQ of everybody, since IQ is a relative concept. If everyone gained a higher test score in a test measuring intelligence, the test would be renormalized, and the average IQ would still be 100. What Flynn effect refers to is those gains in the test scores rather than some increase of everyone's IQ. ",
