            "answer_text": "Visible light forms only a tiny sliver of the EM spectrum. Quantitatively, the EM spectrum ranges over wavelengths from long radio waves at 10^8 meters (the size of Earth) down to very high-energy gamma rays from nuclear processes at 10^-14 meters (the size of a nucleus). This range covers 22 powers of ten! \u2014an enormous variety of wavelengths and characteristics. Of this \u201cmighty kingdom\u201d (as Heinrich Hertz, the discoverer of radio waves, put it), visible light ranges over only about 400 to 700 nanometers (billionths of a meter), less than a power of two and just a fraction of one power of ten. Reality is far more varied than what we might have suspected. The space around you right now is filled with many different radio waves at different wavelengths (as you can prove with a portable radio), microwaves, infrared waves, and some higher-energy ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma ray (very little fortunately). All of these waves fill your room simultaneously, but you cannot directly detect them. Some of this non-visible radiation is detected directly as sunburn (ultraviolet) and radiated warmth (infrared). For more such details, see my nontechnical book \u201cTales of the Quantum\u201d (Oxford University Press, 2017). ",

            "answer_text": "How much of the electromagnetic spectrum we can see is within a range that we cannot put a true ratio on application towards, as we don't fully know what the full breadth of electromagnetic energy encompasses. Some theories have likened our portion of visible light to a measuring stick, one that if was the distance between the Sun and Jupiter, our visible light spectrum would be mere inches on that stick, in comparison to what we cannot see, but are able to detect. This could be that we see less than a trillionth of a trillionth of a percent, though we can't be certain, as we discover new forms of the energy and build a larger understanding all the time. We may have other ways of visually detecting electromagnetic waves, by technology or techniques, but this will be interpreted in our minds in the spectrums the brain is capable, such as in viewing through night vision goggles, the spectrums may be undetected by the eye, but the technology generates an image that the eye takes in within our spectrum, generally greenshifted. This can be considered visible at that point, but it's still within our original spectrum. How much we see may be variable by the source on any percentage, as a different scale 3 inches wide may indicate an eighth is our visible spectrum, or nearer to 12.5 percent. Where even some can argue that our visible spectrum is the prismatic lensing of all the field, which is why it's centered, meaning we see 100 percent, but don't render it that way, through modified restrictions evolved by the eye itself to filter and diffuse the mass overload which would accompany such viewing. So, it may be very little, to all, by some considerations. 0.000000000000000000001 to 100 percent, maybe, and viewing on a philosophical level could even argue for none. Zero percent, because we don't see, our brains create an image from electrochemical stimulation, which renders an image in the conscious mind. ",
