            "answer_text": "Serum calcium levels reported by labs are usually the total calcium, which is comprised of ionized calcium and protein (albumin) bound calcium. This is why we correct for (pseudo)hypocalcemia in the setting of hypoalbinemia. The principle applies in both directions. In the less common case of elevated albumin levels, or hyperalbuminemia, as can be seen in dehydration or multiple myeloma, this should lead to pseudohypercalcemia, or falsely elevated calcium level readout. If a patient has hypocalcemia in the setting of hyperalbuminemia, he or she probably has a dangerously low true level of serum calcium. The correction should be made as per the usual formula used for hypoalbuminemia and the replacement done accordingly. The calcium concentration changes by 0.8 mg/dL for every 1.0 g/dL change in albumin concentration. In hypoalbuminemia, correct calcium level by adding 0.8 for every 1 g/dL albumin below 4.0. For hyperalbuminemia, correct calcium level by subtracting 0.8 for every 1 g/dL albumin above 4.0. For example if a patient has a reported total calcium level of 6.0 mg/dL and an albumin of 5.0 g/dL, his corrected calcium level would be 5.2 mg/dL. Cheers. ",
