            "answer_text": "This is a surprisingly difficult question to answer, because when you get right down to it, it\u2019s like asking \u201cIn simple terms, how fast does a train go?\u201d Electrical charge is a fundamental aspect of matter. It has two different types called positive and negative (these are just conventional names, there\u2019s nothing special about being positively charged vs. negatively charged). It has the peculiar property where like charges (two positive or two negative) will repel each other while two opposed charges (one each of positive and negative) will attract each other. Electric charge is conventionally measured in units called Coulombs, just like speed is conventionally measured in (for example) miles per hour. A coulomb happens to be a very large amount of electrical charge. Electrons are negatively charged, and have an individual charge of -1.6 * 10^-19 Coulombs. This is something that can be (and has been) measured directly. This number isn\u2019t particularly significant, though. There\u2019s nothing preventing us from deciding that an electron\u2019s charge be assigned the label \u201cpositive\u201d instead of negative. There\u2019s nothing stopping us from changing the units we use to measure the \u201camount\u201d of charge such that an electron\u2019s charge becomes 1. Physicists do this all the time, choosing units of measure or sign (+/-) conventions that make things more convenient for themselves. So ultimately, the electron\u2019s charge is just a number that helps describe how the electron behaves around other charged particles. ",

            "answer_text": "An electron is a fundamental particle, unlike protons and neutrons which are made up of partial charges known as quarks. Protons, neutrons and electrons are called the sub-atomic particles which make up an atom. Protons are positively charged and electrons are negatively charged while neutrons have zero charge. Electrons are found in the orbitals, outside the nucleus of an atom which contains the protons and neutrons which are collectively called the neucleons. It was J.J.Thompson from Cambridge University who discovered the electron in the latter half of the 1800\u2019s. When compared to protons and neutrons, an electron has an extremely small mass. However, both the electron and proton have the same magnitude of charge. Charges are measured in units called coulombs(C). The charge on one electron is \u20131.6 x 10\u201319 coulomb. During nuclear reactions or radioactive decay, a positively charged electron known as positron is released from the nuclei of certain atoms. Although positively charged, a positron has an extremely small mass like an electron. ",
