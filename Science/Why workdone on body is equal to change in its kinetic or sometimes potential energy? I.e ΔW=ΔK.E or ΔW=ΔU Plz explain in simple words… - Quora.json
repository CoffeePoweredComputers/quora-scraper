            "answer_text": "Total Energy= Total work done= \u2206K.E +\u2206P.E ( law of conservation of energy). K.E is due to motion and P.E is due to position. If an object moves means its K.E change, so its position will also change which brings Change in P.E. In simple words, if you have done 5j of work on an object by lifting up, this 5j is used to bring the object at some height now this work is save in the object in the form of P.E, when ever you released that stored energy of 5j will be used to bring that object back to its original position.

            "answer_text": "The force dose work on the body and this work change its total energy, so the work must equal to the change of total energy. We can orove that in simple matematics . If the body moves on a horizontal plan , so there is only kinetic energy and no potential energy change.If the body moves vertically up at equilibrium ,then the change is only in potential energy and no change in kinetic energy.so it depends on the situation of the case.
