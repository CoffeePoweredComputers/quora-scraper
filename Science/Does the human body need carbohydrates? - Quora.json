            "answer_text": "First of all, let me start with stating that our bodies need FAR less carbohydrates than most people think. I mean really, really significantly less than most people think. In fact, you can live more or less normally if you consume ZERO carbohydrates. Your body has a wonderful mechanism to prevent starvation in such case by entering ketosis. Carbs are just a source of energy (and, well, tasty food, most of the time, too, I agree). But your body can utilize other sources to generate ATP (energy currency that supports all biological processes) - it can use fat and even proteins. It\u2019s extremely versatile that way. If you do not consume any carbohydrates (or if you consume far less than would be required to support your energy needs), your body switches to using fat for energy - that can be stored body fat or dietary fat that you consume with food. Your brain (which accounts for about 20% of energy needs) cannot use fat directly (fat cannot cross blood brain barrier), but a byproduct of fat metabolism (ketone bodies) can - and they are actually a cleaner and more efficient substrate for energy production in the brain. The only cells that absolutely must get glucose to get energy through anaerobic glycolysis are red blood cells (they don\u2019t have mitochondria to oxidize fat). But that requirement is quite low compared to your overall energy needs - and it can still be easily satisfied even if you consume zero exogenous carbs (your body can actually turn other substrates into glucose to satisfy that requirement through a process called gluconeogenesis). So you don\u2019t technically need carbohydrates - you can perfectly survive without them. Would I recommend a zero-carb diet? No. And it would be EXTREMELY difficult to achieve, too, because small amount of carbs will be lurking in a lot of food you wouldn\u2019t even suspect. But would I recommend low-carb diet? Absolutely! Anything around 20-40 grams per day (unless you are pregnant) would be just fine. In fact - there are multiple medical benefits of drastically reducing carbs. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem is that your brain only runs on glucose. It cannot use fat as a metabolic fuel (your muscles or liver, for example, can run on either). (All dietary sugars are converted into glucose in the gut wall). In situations where there isn't enough glucose (e.g. because you don't eat enough), there is a metabolic process called gluconeogenesis which converts some amino acids into glucose. But it's not terribly effective; it's like driving your car in reverse. You can do it, but it's awkward. In situations of extreme glucose depletion, your brain can run on ketones. For some reason these are called ketone bodies in the literature. Again ketones come from protein breakdown, and again it is very inefficient. In order to get enough protein your body will sacrifice any protein within you to make ketones. This is a starvation situation. Low carb diets are designed to create these two scenarios to some extent. They provide lots of protein for these unusual metabolic processes, but no carbs, which forces you into gluconeogenesis or even ketosis. It seems likely that our human ancestors were used to having periods where food was scarce (e.g. long winters) or when protein (such as animals) was available but carbs (like fruit or grains) wasn't. So some people think it's good for us to mimic these conditions for ourselves. I have some sympathy with this view. \"Carbohydrates\" also includes indigestible material such as cellulose, which we normally call roughage or dietary fibre. This provides stools with bulk which our colons seem to like. It's not essential I suppose, but it's a helpful part of our diet. ",

And the liver will start synthesizing new glucose by breaking down fat. If the body still don't get glucose after the stores are used, the whole body will start a stress response where every cell is on high alert and the liver, which can't keep up on the glucose production, will start breaking down our muscle mass to make the alternative brain fuel: keton bodies. However keton bodies are not as good as glucose, and after an extended period they can cause a really toxic state. And all through this the body is in high stress mode. The body also have many sugar groups attached to important signals and signal receivers. The body needs glucose to make these sugar components efficiently. So lack of carbohydrates will stress the body, which can lead to hypertension and heart and kidney problems. It has a risk of initiating a toxic state. And it will make body function and regulation less efficient. ",

But, but\u2026\u201cglucose is the preferred energy source of the brain.\u201d Why this sorry sad refrain from those with glucose addled brains? I usually tell a story as it's easier to part the glucose brain fog that way. The human body does what is easiest first. We are a survival machine and in a world without grocery stores, nobody would be having this conversation because you would eat every stick of whatever you could find. Its kinda like asking little Billy if he wants chips or carrot sticks. Of course he prefers chips but carrot sticks are healthier. Just because your body can do the easiest route does not mean its the correct way in our modern world. E-go 2019 rainday ",

If no glucose is available, the body can use stored glycogen, or it can turn to fats. However, getting energy from fat is inefficient and can have side effects, and some parts of the body still require glucose. The body can make its own glucose using protein from elsewhere in the body, which keeps glucose-dependent processes running. It\u2019s a lot easier, however, to just eat some carbs. They won\u2019t kill you, I promise. ",

By acting as energy source, carbs makes proteins available for muscle building and maintenance.Promotes digestive health. Complex carbs are rich in dietary fibre hence provides soluble fibre. Soluble fibre is perfect for keeping indigestion at bay, maintain blood cholesterol and glucose levels.Lack of carbs affects our normal metabolism and assures smooth functioning of body processes.Ideal intake of carbs also regulates our mood.Consuming the right carbs is necessary for mental health, and sugar can negatively affect your mood.Carbs are the source of energy for our brain hence lack of carbs might affect brain health as well.Complex carbs also keeps our colon healthy.",
