            "answer_text": "Falsifiability in science is how objective truth is established. Falsifiability means that a theory makes a prediction that can be tested by measurement. This happens all the time. Newton's theory of gravity makes a prediction for how much the ray of light from a distant star will be bent by the gravity of the Sun. Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity makes a different prediction. During an eclipse of the Sun by the moon, it's possible to measure the actual bending by taking pictures of stars near the Sun. Such a measurement could fail to be precise enough to falsify either theory, or it could be different from both predictions and this falsify both theories, or it could falsify one theory but confirm the prediction of the other theory. In this case, photographs falsified Newtonian gravity and were consistent with relativity. For a theory to be scientific, it must make predictions that can be compared with observable reality, and this is what it means to be falsifiable. It's a little more complex than that, but that's the basic idea. A theory that has passed many potentially falsifying tests and failed none obviously contains a great deal of knowledge about objective reality. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Falsehood is no stranger to the science world, but the neat thing about science is how quickly it gets called out. I have seen some claims of unusual results, and immediately you start seeing others trying to replicate the results and not being able to do so. That is a refutation of those findings, but also it's the destruction of the originating scientist's reputation! Nobody wants that! So as a result of the scientific method, false claims are few. They generally are due to failure to catch what may have been an honest error. Nobody gets a career in science by lying. Nobody. ",
