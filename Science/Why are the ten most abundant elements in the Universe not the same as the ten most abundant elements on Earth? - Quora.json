Earth (and (all?) other planets) have a very different elemental composition, because most planetary elements were forged deep inside stars, and subsequently blown into space by nova and supernova and hypernova events, some of the remains of which were eventually accreted into the luxurious life-giving Earth we inhabit today. We are all made up of atoms forged inside stars!  Universe Constituent Elements chart lifted from www.pinsdaddy.com page Abundance Of Elements In The Universe.

            "answer_text": "Q: In simple terms, why are the ten most abundant elements in the Universe not the same as the ten most abundant elements on Earth? A: Gravity. When star systems form, gravity from the central lump of proto-star mass acts like a sieve, roughly sorting dust and gas according to its density. Then as planets form, it does so from what exist around that orbit. It\u2019s not a uniform mix, and there are also indications that planets move around a lot in a forming solar system, before it sorted itself out. ",
