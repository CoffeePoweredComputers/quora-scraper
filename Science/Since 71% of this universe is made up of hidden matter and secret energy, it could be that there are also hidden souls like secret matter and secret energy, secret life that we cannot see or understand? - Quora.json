            "answer_text": "Asked to answer, thank you. Q: Since 71% of this universe is made up of hidden matter and secret energy, it could be that there are also hidden souls like secret matter and secret energy, secret life that we cannot see or understand? Our current peer reviewed \u201cbest guesses\u201d as to the composition of existence comes down to two \u201cstandard models\u201d. Quantum Field Theory, and the Lamda-CDM model (relativity plus dark matter and dark energy). And a whack of hypothetical suggestions as to exactly what might cause it all.  Foam, loops, fields, strings, dimensions, forces, quarks, fermions, bosuns, Dark Energy and Dark Matter, and a lot of other things. Oh yeah, and \u201ctime\u201d. They boil down to this:  Which is mathematically consistent with this\u2026 \u201cwave-particle-duality\u201d QFT.   WITHIN that fuzzy framework, I think one could make some claims that perhaps \u201cit could be that there are also hidden souls like secret matter and secret energy, secret life that we cannot see or understand?\u201d Who would be able to say for sure. However. This.  Is also mathematically compatible with this:  But it is not the best mathematically consistent explanation either. Add a dimension. (expand outwards spherically by an equal amount in every direction, splitting the plane in half).  And you get 1, of an infinite set of identical, physical spherical-wave-SHAPED-units\u2026 Which are mathematically consistent and logically more plausible than any current suggestion as to what existence is made of.  A \u201cterritory\u201d that matches all observations AND makes sense, needing only physical \u201creal\u201d units, plus motion to generate and host all the other phenomena that we observe and experience.  So when looking for things \u201chidden and secret\u201d\u2026 the question becomes, does the component, plus the way they work, create any mathematical reason to suspect or conclude or believe in \u201csecret hidden souls and secret matter and secret energy\u201d. I strongly suggest that when given exhaustive knowledge of what existence is made of, and exhaustive knowledge of how existence works, there will remain zero mathematically or physically plausibly supportable \u201chidden\u201d anything's. I don\u2019t think any hidden, or supernatural anything\u2019s are going to survive our finding of complete understanding of what existence is made of and how it works. ",

            "answer_text": "I will write an article here to give some credence to the question and the way to look at the information that exists. First of all only about 5% of the universe\u2019s total content is visible ! Surprised ? That visible portion is visible matter only, also termed \u2018baryonic matter\u2019. The rest of the content is made up of dark matter which constitutes around 27% of the universe, and the remaining 68% is taken up by dark energy ! For ease of remembrance I have rounded off the values to whole numbers. We only knew about visible matter in the first half of the twentieth century. It was Albert Einstein who introduced the concept of an \u2018anti-gravity\u2019 field which must exist to balance out the gravitational collapsing tendency. This was his \u2018cosmological constant\u2019, that appears as the Greek letter lambda in the general relativity field equations. With Hubble\u2019s discovery of an expanding universe with the discovery of the Doppler red shift, Einstein felt he had made a mistake and that the \u2018cosmological constant\u2019 which he thought of for a static universe had prevented him from predicting an expanding universe. He called it the \u201cgreatest blunder of my life !\u201d So the concept was nearly forgotten till the late 90s. Data emerged from astrophysical observations that the universe was expanding fast and had started expanding much faster around 5 to 6 billion years ago which suggested a very powerful \u2018anti-gravity\u2019 assistance mechanism that had emerged more detectably to continue to make the universe expand fast against gravitational pull back ! Thus Einstein\u2019s \u2018cosmological constant\u2019 came back with remarkable consistency with the data matching within 10% of what was predicted from general relativity with that concept therein ! Even when he thought he was wrong, he turned out to be right ! How amazing is that ? A rediscovery of his sheer genius ! Most poignantly this \u2018anti-gravity\u2019 mechanism would have to present whether the universe was static or expanding\u2026 It took nearly eight decades to discover this which is now called dark energy. Also within the last thirty years further galactic gravitational data opened up the mystery of where was all the rest of the visible matter to explain intra-galactic gravitational stability ?? The galaxies seemed to require nearly five times the mass to warrant the gravitational stability noted. If such huge matter or mass was not visible where could it be ? Thus was largely born the concept of dark matter with no reflectivity, or complete transparency as is believed through which all visible light will pass, and not get reflected al all. So such matter can not be seen visually in the darkness of space with no reflection. It has been postulated that it does not interact with light, other EM waves, or visible matter except gravitationally ! Have we made this up with one thing functional that fits the need here, namely gravitational interaction ?? It could appear that way also. However once postulated to exist its putative mass can explain the gravitational behavior of the galaxy very accurately. You see when it comes to dark matter, and dark energy we have no way of isolating it and study it in the lab ! It is not possible. So we are left with powerful theoretical tools to lend credence to the existence of these two phenomena. So going back to your question there is no \u201csecret soul\u201d or \u201csecret life\u201d in the realm of the above astrophysical phenomena that I am referring to. These become more of processes that explain astrophysical phenomena. The \u201chidden matter\u201d or \u201csecret matter\u201d you are referring to fits \u2018dark matter\u2019, and the \u201csecret energy\u201d you are referring to fits dark energy by the semblance of nomenclature. Needless to say we know even less about dark energy than we know about dark matter\u2026 KT ",
