            "answer_text": "No - in addition to having energy associated with \u201cself motion,\u201d particle configurations gain energy by virtue of their physical arrangement with respect to other particles. For example, two electrons 1 cm apart (and motionless) contains less energy of this type than two electrons a 1 mm apart (and motionless). The energy enters the system from the force you apply to push them together against the repulsive \u201clike charges\u201d force. This is potential energy, and it has a different dependence on the state variables defining the system than kinetic energy does. This difference is highlighted when you calculate the Lagrangian of a system, in preparation for obtaining the equations of motion using principles of variational calculus. In simple systems the Lagrangian is \u201ckinetic energy minus potential energy.\u201d The two categories enter into the calculation with opposite signs, making it clear that those \u201cbuckets of energy\u201d are not interchangeable. Edit: Thanks to Alan Feldman for catching my initial mistake - I clearly said both particles were electrons in my example, but then stated the relationship of energy contents for the two separation as though they had opposite charge. Appreciate the catch, Alan! ",

            "answer_text": "In the case of mechanical potential energy, like in a spring, it does change the energy levels of electrons, such that they might be moving faster, so also have more kinetic energy. Chemical potential energy is also in electrons which might have different kinetic energy. But there is also energy in the electric field itself. Gravitational potential energy is in the gravitational field, which doesn\u2019t give electrons more kinetic energy, but maybe it does for gravitons. But now you have to ask about kinetic energy, which comes from relativity in a not so obvious way. ",
