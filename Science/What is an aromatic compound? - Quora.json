            "answer_text": " In organic chemistry, the term aromaticity is used to describe a cyclic (ring-shaped), planar(flat) molecule with a ring of resonance bonds that exhibits more stability than other geometric or connective arrangements with the same set of atoms. Aromatic molecules are very stable, and do not break apart easily to react with other substances. Organic compounds that are not aromatic are classified as aliphatic compounds\u2014they might be cyclic, but only aromatic rings have special stability (low reactivity). Since the most common aromatic compounds are derivatives of benzene (an aromatic hydrocarbon common in petroleumand its distillates), the word \u201caromatic\u201d occasionally refers informally to benzene derivatives, and so it was first defined. Nevertheless, many non-benzene aromatic compounds exist. In living organisms, for example, the most common aromatic rings are the double-ringed bases in RNA and DNA. An aromatic functional group or other substituent is called an aryl group. The earliest use of the term \"aromatic\" was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. [1] Hofmann used the term for a class of benzene compounds, many of which have odors (aromas), unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons. Aromaticity as a chemical property bears no general relationship with the olfactory properties of such compounds (how they smell), although in 1855, before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood, chemists like Hofmann were beginning to understand that odiferous molecules from plants, such as terpenes, had chemical properties that we recognize today are similar to unsaturated petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene. In terms of the electronic nature of the molecule, aromaticity describes a conjugated system often made of alternating single and double bonds in a ring. This configuration allows for the electrons in the molecule's pi system to be delocalized around the ring, increasing the molecule's stability. The molecule cannot be represented by one structure, but rather a resonance hybrid of different structures, such as with the two resonance structures of benzene. These molecules cannot be found in either one of these representations, with the longer single bonds in one location and the shorter double bond in another (see Theory below). Rather, the molecule exhibits bond lengths in between those of single and double bonds. This commonly seen model of aromatic rings, namely the idea that benzene was formed from a six-membered carbon ring with alternating single and double bonds (cyclohexatriene), was developed by August Kekul\u00e9 (see History below). The model for benzene consists of two resonance forms, which corresponds to the double and single bonds superimposing to produce six one-and-a-half bonds. Benzene is a more stable molecule than would be expected without accounting for charge delocalization. ",

            "answer_text": "The name Aromatic compound come from the Greek word aroma which means sweet smell, as aromatic hydrocarbons are generally sweet smelling.Aromatic compounds is a cyclic organic compound ( hydrocarbon and its derivatives ) and it must follow huckel's law of aromaticity. It states that those cyclic compounds which has 4n + 2 delocalized \u03c0 electron clouds where n = 0, 1,2,3,4,\u2026\u2026 can be called as aromatic compounds. For example, Benzene contains 6 delocalized \u03c0 electrons i.e 4n +2 = 6 thus n= 1 . So it is aromatic. Aromatic compounds burn with sooty flame and do not go addition reaction easily as they are resonance stabilized and Prefer electrophilic substitution reaction. ",
