            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say possibly yes, probably no. I am not sure what you are talking about when you say, \u201cmathematical and especially statistical illiteracy in the [United States]\u201d. Your question scatters your thoughts around the text of your query, but it sounds to me like you are speculating that the risk assessment of the novel coronavirus and cancer and perhaps some other things is much overestimated (\u201c\u2026illiteracy\u2026 at the root of much of the panic?\u201d) ???? There are things such as cancer which are generally very rare, but when they strike, one\u2019s life is turned inside out or utterly destroyed. Is it true that one\u2019s chances of being a victim of an automobile accident are much greater that dying of, say, colon cancer? I don\u2019t know the probabilities, but I do know that if one drives moderately and observes traffic rules, the likelihood of an accident goes down sharply. Likewise, getting colonoscopies or other types of screening can stop cancer in its tracks before it establishes the foothold which so often is the difference between life and death. These are simple, sensible precautions which one can do to drastically improve the length and quality of one\u2019s life. It just makes sense to take a few simple steps to avoid potential tragedy. On the other hand, scientific findings are being drowned out by fake news when it comes to general knowledge about the novel coronavirus. We have only been observing this thing for a few months, so it is not surprising that we do not have solid hard facts. Different sources do suggest differences in what is going on, to the point where one person insists that wearing a mask is actually stupid, and social distancing is pointless and ineffectual, and we might all just as well get back to work, since it\u2019s likely that we will be fine for the most part, and besides, we really have to get back to work. Sheltering in place (puhleez don\u2019t call it lockdown unless you\u2019re in prison) is just destroying the economy of many nations without giving us any benefit. And here we have the nub of the matter, I believe, because this position \u2014 that most precautions are useless and do actually prevent the disease that much, while devastating our economy \u2014 is not really foolishness. It is one way of looking at the problem, and it is not crazy. It is an attempt to weigh the risk of stalling our fragile economies (economic chaos) and massive death tolls if we open up the economy. No matter how we analyze the risks, there will be people who will claim that some aspect of the risks is overstated or others factors are not sufficiently stated. As we evaluate these things, the real hazard is that we have already pretty decided what we suspect is the right choice, and when we hear snippets about various factors, we actually hear things that support our view, and just don\u2019t absorb things that oppose it. One vital fact is that opening up the economy exposes the vulnerable who have been staying safe, because inevitably the folks returning to work are also helping their older friends and neighbors to take care of shopping, transportation and other things, so that we not only risk infection of self, we risk infection of anyone we are close to. People just don\u2019t wish to look at how drastically this changes the dimensions of the risks involved \u2014 and that is just one small aspect of the matter. As if this were not enough, the World Health Organization is being labeled a bunch of fools and buffoons, and the Center for Disease Control is viewed as having been muzzled and coopted by our foolish Republicans. thus, the very experts who are trying to guide us in terms of statistics that are no easy task to understand at all are being sabotaged by elements who want to silence the voice of scientific inquiry. These folks may well be in some cases real buffoons \u2014 but they are the only buffoons we\u2019ve got who have a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of giving wise counsel on how to manage the risks of the current epidemic. It\u2019s almost the perfect storm of engineered distrust in authority. This, I submit, is one hell of a situation. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I would disagree with your assertion that the USA is in a state of panic. We are heavily afflicted due to stupid choices, but we are not in panic. And the stupid choices are about be corrected on November 3rd and put into action on January 20th. Secondly, I will point out that while it is true that grade schools in the USA are not as good as they should be (no reflection on the teachers or other personnel, but things such as \"no child left behind\" and budgeting lunacy are behind these issues), yet our colleges and universities are well known to be the very best in the world. So keep your aspersions as to our math abilities to yourself. And third, I would disagree that Covid, cancer, and other things in life are best understood in numerical terms. It makes me wonder what math formula you might use when considering love and marriage. Oh, brother, do you sound full of yourself. Now, having rebuked your superiority complex and dutifully defended my country's honor, I will concede that we are experiencing one math problem as relates to Covid. This problem is that the Trump worshipers who serve their orange skinned idol seem to be very, very bad with math. For example, they cannot comprehend that having the highest per capia infection rate in the world does NOT mean we have done the best Covid mitigation job in the world. Likewise, they think that 215,000 dead in 7 months of Covid is a lower death rate than 35,000 dead from flu in an entire year, and they also think that a mortality rate of between 5 percent and 18 percent of infected Covid patients is better than a less than 1 percent mortality rate for people infected with flu. These same math-challenged individuals think that magic is more trustworthy than science, masks increase Covid infections instead of reducing them, and testing increases the number of people who have Covid and die from it (which is why they want to \"slow the testing down\" -Trump). Fortunately, the number of people voting for Biden is > greater than those voting for Trump. So, math lessons for these Trump followers will commence shortly. ",
