            "answer_text": "That is one of the many different cosmological theories of the Big Bang. One particular older variant of this is the so-called \u201cBig Crunch\u201d theory, where the universe expands, and then starts to fall in on itself because of gravity, into a so-called \u201cBig Crunch\u201d, and then explodes again in another Big Bang, creating a new universe. Science fiction and comic book writers have explored this idea a lot since the 1950\u2019s, including James Blish in the Cities in Flight series, and Stan Lee and Jack Kirby with the origins of Galactus. I think modern physics has more or less ruled out the Big Crunch as a possibility, because gravity isn\u2019t strong enough. But it\u2019s still an intriguing possibility. Big Crunch - Wikipedia ",
