            "answer_text": "A2A Am I the only one that found the society depicted in A Brave New World to be extremely appealing? I don\u2019t find the society depicted in Brave New World to be appealing, but I can understand that some people might. Maybe others find the idea of government provided recreational drugs (so much soma!) and a culture of endless orgies to be appealing \u2014 while also assuming they would be in one of the more priveledged classes that have ease and also some degree of personal choice and mobility. \u2026.Choice to the extent it exists in that dystopia\u2026. After all, we never saw what life was like in depth at the very bottom of the hierarchy, which to me is the biggest flaw of that great work. So no, I can\u2019t tell you I find your enjoying Brave New World \u201cstrange\u201d, no matter how you connect to it or on what level. The point of the depiction of the danger of that society was that it was appealing to those it numbed and distracted and didn\u2019t have to conquer them by force. They were happy to do not so ethical things because they were kept numb or comfortable or in pleasant circumstances. Those who knew better didn\u2019t care: they held power. The society was not concerned with the well-being of specific people because they were told and believed it was for the good of all. And it felt that way through cheap misdirection via easy access to gratification. (Aldous Huxley discused this in comparison to the dystopia by Orwell in 1984 Amy Goldfarb's answer to What is your favorite Aldous Huxley passage?). Maybe you understand that now on some level. How that could happen. Not minding the ethically dubious part. How appealing the rest can sound. I get it: that\u2019s the point. It\u2019s there for you to learn that. I can tell you that if I hypothetically learned you actually think some people are better than others in this reality and automatically deserve better stations in life due to their genes, or if you genuinely support actual eugenics in our reality such as applied in the story or any other way\u2014 or support applying any other number of unethical concepts that create the society you find appealing in the work Brave New World? That\u2019s not the same as the first thing I said. In that different case, I hypothetically would authentically find you disturbing and morally bankrupt. ",

But looking back later, I understood that there were expectations to act a certain way and people didn\u2019t escape the judgement from the society at all. So I read the whole book expecting some kind of punishment for those who didn\u2019t fit in the system, only to find out at the end that the punishment was... not actually a punishment. I also kept asking myself how that world compares to the lives of the majority of the population, and how we are somehow conditioned by media to want certain things or be a certain way, but we still don\u2019t get those things and never achieve the comfort of fitting in as opposed to the society in the book.

            "answer_text": "It is appealing. That\u2019s the point. Huxley set up the dystopia in which humans would amuse themselves into submission. Comfort is the only goal. Take a look around. If you have a smart phone, cheap plentiful access to internet, and food in the fridge, that's the future he predicted. A job befitting your class, no social striving because the talkies (TV) is better, and soma (alcohol, prescription meds, or, where it is legal, marijuana) to calm the nerves. This is in contrast to the authoritarian dystopia proposed by Orwell in 1984. Should we try to derail our stasis in Huxley's nightmare, Orwell's awaits us. ",

Yes, losing individuality and freedom seems scary, but when traded for guaranteed safety, drugs, and sex, it may be worth it. Personally, I resonate with John\u2019s quote at the end of the book: \u201cBut I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.\u201d Though, I can understand why some people prefer the comfort lifestyle. ",
