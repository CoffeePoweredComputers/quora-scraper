            "answer_text": "Who the hell are we getting answers from? A railway engineer, a PhD in Networking, a stage performer, a good at being awesome person? They do not have a clue about dark or even simple magic!! People forbid the ways of magic/wizardry/witchcraft/sorcery/enchantment/necromancy/or even voodoo practice! The only thing that\u2019s left is Alchemy aka Chemistry in modern science. Energy drinks ain\u2019t a fancy name for potions boosting rage? Transmit of radio waves. Is it not a magic? You may say it\u2019s all science but back then when nobody understood it, they called it real magic. Ofcourse, we forgot most of the stuff but magic is still here. The dark magic you so desperately search even exists now but not openly discussed on forum. Those who do are hypocrite for certain. People are afraid of India cuz we know black magic. Well, sure we did in our story-telling bed time stories. BTW, the spell Avada Kadavra in Harry Potter series is actually copied from indian stories which is actually pronounced Abra-ka-dabra Gili-gili-chhu. This spell was never used to kill or for evil intentions but it had so many references that even J K Rowling had to use it somewhere. But, Wikipedia never mentioned about India being related to this spell. Do you have any idea why people of Japan still believe in omen and dark magic even when their crowd is so educated? People are not stupid. Blind people are. Mind consciousness! How do u describe it? Another fancy name for spirit. Do you seriously believe if you do some chemistry and replicate a real human body, will it start moving on its own? Of course, its not exactly real magic, as the world now says, but scientists are researching on this too. Talismans, astrology and tarot cards never really showed actual reliable results. So, please do not believe on anything to be magic. Magic is something that is purely science as long as the logic is kept secret, otherwise you would call it science. ",

            "answer_text": "This question has used three extremely tough words \u201cScience\u201d, \u201cBlack\u201d and \u201cMagic\u201d. If Science is to be defined as \u201cidentifying the whys and hows of the universe without prejudice\u201d, then everything in this universe that creates awe shall cause the scientific instinct to ignite. Looking for reasons, observing phenomena and collating them with previously identified standards is another mechanism of defining science for some other people. Depending on which definition of science is chosen, \u201cmagic\u201d assumes a different definition. For the performer, magic is a well practiced routine of actions using props and assistants, performed in a sequence that has been planned with a view to mislead the audience into believing the impossible happening through illusory audio and visual effects. For the audience, it is different. Although each one in teh audience knows that magic is make believe, they like to get led away by the performer and they like to believe the impossible happening in front of their eyes. Till the time this act is for entertainment, it is PLAIN MAGIC. It has several sciences in play. Right from Hypnotism, Psychology and Illusion, to visual effects, Magic is 100% science. The performer has to be a master of the phenomena he controls. When these acts are used to deceive gullible people into believing supernatural phenomena, this magic becomes BLACK\u2026 So there is a lot of science in Black Magic. While saying this, I must acknowledge our lack of knowledge about several phenomena that are occurring in nature. The inability to reason such occurrences is nothing short of magic. ",
