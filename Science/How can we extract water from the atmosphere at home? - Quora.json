            "answer_text": "By far the easiest method is to let nature do the work for you:  Rainwater is exactly what you\u2019re after: water condensed from the atmosphere. If you wanted a specific process that turned atmospheric humidity into liquid water, the process is going to be energetically expensive. The best small-scale approach is probably to use a cold or very cold surface to condense or freeze atmospheric water. This can then be chipped off or otherwise melted off to give you extracted atmospheric water:  Icing up of liquid nitrogen tanks is pretty common. Wear suitable protective gloves. The energy costs for doing this are pretty enormous. Another approach is to compress humid air, this increases the dew point and causes condensation at higher temperatures. Most air compressors have a water drain valve to remove exactly this type of water. Unless you\u2019re extremely confident of the cleanliness of the inside of your compressor, I wouldn\u2019t drink this. The final approach is to burn something biological, eg wood or other plant-based material. Cool the smoke and gases to room temperature or below and this will cause water to condense. The water will part come from remaining humidity in the wood itself and also the water generated by combustion. For a simple example here\u2019s methane combustion: CH4 + 2O2 ==> CO2 + 2H2O This water will definitely need cleaning before drinking (it\u2019ll be contaminated with combustion products) but distilling it or passing through a charcoal filter (ironically) should allow it to be potable. That said, I\u2019d stick to rainwater myself. ",

            "answer_text": "Frank Herbert introduced a concept in his \u2018Dune\u2019 series that would be reasonably effective without requiring electricity. He describes large wind scoops that catch the prevailing winds and channel them underground. Because the ground is typically cooler than the air on a summer day it cools as it passes through the space below ground causing precipitation. If you were to place a large tank in the ground and mount a wind scoop to channel air through it, it would gradually collect condensation. Adding baffles to slow and disrupt the air flow in the tank would make it more efficient. Of course this all depends on prevailing humidity levels in your area. Dry air would be prone to cause evaporation faster than it produced condensation. But if your humidity levels average 60% or higher you should have reasonable success. Remember to provide a way for the air to vent from the tank as well otherwise you will get no significant flow. ",
