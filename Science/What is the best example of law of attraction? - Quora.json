            "answer_text": "Take a very good look at your relationship with your mother and father. See the people in your close vicinity (people you both love and hate) share those similarities in their personalities. Look at the people you are attracted to and see how similar they are to the opposite gendered parent. If you are homosexual, explore if you are embody more \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cmasculine\u201d energy and discern from there. We attract who we are. Who we are is a response to our mother and father. Either we are similar to them or contradicting to them. We unconsciously attract situations and scenarios that replay similar feelings of our childhood past. And for as long as you know how to psychoanalyze your limited core beliefs and do inner child work, you can start having some real control in your reality which is essentially a reflection of you. That\u2019s the real simple answer to how the law of attraction works. To me, it\u2019s essentially Freudian & Jungian psychology. The metaphysical aspect, for me, is that I think it\u2019s amazing how detailed and on-time the universe can be when it comes to playing out our psyches. ",
