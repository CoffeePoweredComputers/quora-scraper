            "answer_text": "Yes, generally alkenes have higher melting and boiling point than alkanes. The rule of thumb is \u201cHigher the intermolecular forces (the force by which molecules attract molecules), higher is the melting and boiling point\u201d. Alkanes are apolar i.e their molecules have negligible dipole moment because of almost equal electronegativity of C and H atoms. The only attractive force between alkane molecules is induced dipole-induced dipole weak Van der Wall\u2019s forces. That\u2019s why their melting and boiling point is very low. Alkenes have little dipole moment in them. Their intermolecular forces is dipole-induced dipole-dipole Van der Wall\u2019s forces. However these dipole moments are low, so the melting and boiling points of alkenes are only little higher than alkanes. Then the question rises why alkenes possess little dipole moments as they have also C and H only? The answer is the \u03c0\u03c0 bond of alkenes are loosely held and move more freely than \u03c3\u03c3 bond. The alkyl group attached to carbon containing double bond pushes its electron during momentarily absence of the \u03c0\u03c0 electron from the vicinity of C atom containing double bond. Hence the alkyl group shows +I (pushing Inductive effect) when attached to double bonded C atom. This gives a little dipole moment to the alkene molecule. As we can see, Dipole moment of Propane is 0.08 D Dipole moment of Propene is 0.36 D and, Dipole moment of cis But-2\u2013ene is 0.33 D Dipole moment of trans But-2-ene is negligible.  ",

            "answer_text": "For similar compounds - like alkanes or alkenes, freeze, the process is a lot like stacking bricks. The more symmetrical the molecules are, the easier it will be and the fewer spaces there will be between the molecules hence better stacking. So, if you keep it to alkanes, for a moment, n-alkanes will stack better and have higher melting points than the corresponding branched analog (e.g., hexane vs to its structural isomer, 2-methylpentane). But, this is not the only consideration because, as alkanes become more highly branched this makes them more compact and sphere-like. As the surface area of the molecule decreases they will become more compact, easier to pack and the melting point will gradually rise - see the table below.  Now the story for alkenes is the same. What has to be considered is how well the molecules (alkanes, alkenes, others) pack. Even in a very simple case, the trend stated in the question is not true. Consider: n-butane mp = -138 \u00baC1-butene mp = -185 \u00baCE-2-butene mp = -119 \u00baCZ-2-butene mp = -131 \u00baC So, here two of the alkenes has a lower melting point than the alkane (just to cover my ass, there is considerable variability in these numbers from sources available on the web (e.g., PubChem). If we increase the alkane by one carbon the numbers are: n-pentane mp = -130 \u00baC1-pentene mp = -165 \u00baCE-2-pentene mp = -151 \u00baCZ-2-pentene mp = -145 \u00baC And this is in line with what was stated in the question. Still, this generality has some exceptions as suggested by the examples above. ",
