            "answer_text": "I haven't read The Tyranny of Science, but I can speak to this generally. Feyerabend believed that 'science' was little more than a social practice: a way of doing things that was effective and pragmatic, but didn't have any necessary ontological or methodological underpinnings. Science is just another area of human activity, like writing romance novels, playing golf, or singing in the shower. For Feyerabend, the elevation of 'science' to a 'thing' that somehow embodies reason, progress, and goodness is an ultimately political move: a way of establishing social power. It would make perfect sense in this vein to say (for instance) that capitalism, democracy, and science are the Holy Trinity of Western Modernism: the ideals of those three things are what define Western Modernism, and the things themselves don't need to exist or have meaning in practice so long as people can lay firm political claim to the words. In this sense 'science' becomes a trump card that people play without much regard to actual usage. Anything that can be labeled as scientific is intrinsically good, anything that can be labelled as unscientific or non-scientific (and it's worth taking a moment to reflect on how utterly meaningless those two words are) is intrinsically bad, irrational, insane, stupid, etc. And so on one hand we find people trying to elevate the most vapid and random thoughts as 'scientific', because being scientific sells; and on the other hand we find people treating actual scientific research as though it were some sort of divine law, never to be contradicted, questioned, or reflected on.  I swear, every time I explain the Theory of Evolution on the internet - which involves explaining why it's a very good theory, but not an iron-clad truth - I get nasty pot-shots from both sides. Annoying... This deification of science, then, tends to spread out through the culture. People try to force their college-age children into 'scientific' disciplines and away from the arts and humanities, because 'science' is 'better'. People stop thinking about ethics or the flow of history because they are obsessed with the instantaneous 'progress' of 'science'. It makes for a sterile world: a world of plastic doohickies and bright flashy things with no real substance (because substance requires history); a world where we focus on how cool it is to have robotic drones raining missiles down on our unsuspecting enemies out of a clear blue sky, and never get to the moral issue of blowing up potentially innocent strangers who have absolutely no defense against or foreknowledge of their impending death.

            "answer_text": "I don't know a lot about him actually. He had some good valid points. In a very simple way my best understandings of how to apply his ideas to answer your question is: He stated that science was no different that myth. In some ways this is true as science does often make extreme leaps in theory to form an initial hypothesis, some are later proven wrong. Even Einstein was proven wrong on some theories and the fact that you can see some scientist and intelligent people today ride the fence on things mainstream science cant find a way to disprove or prove. From the least rational (to me) claims like ghosts and ancient aliens to the ones that in my mind have a stronger premise and higher number of believers such as life after death, a creator, life  somewhere in the universe. He thought we couldnt separate our social/moral ideas from actual science. We the sheep tend to make policy based on the conventions of the time rather than science. I do agree here pretty strongly actually. Reefer Madness started a pointless debate that continues today. Its also created a tax draining part of government in the form of the DEA, which has been ineffective completely and that can been observed by anyone living in the USA by the people they see on drugs. So to seem more effective rather than actually losing the cumbersome department the government gave them the right to interfere with doctor/patient relationships via prescription drug laws. Which as I see now as being Scientist(DR) + A nonscientific entity with an agenda (DEA) = Prescription medication to we the people. Regardless of your thoughts pro or con you must admit the DEA has an agenda even if you think its to protect the people. The other side of the coin further demonstrates this. The government leaves the task of testing that must be done prior to releasing a new drug in the hands of the parent company, creating the wolf protecting the hen house scenario.There are many things that are driven by policy, culture, and pseudoscience we follow today that go against what actual cold hard facts science would probably say is wrong on a basic level or that science/social sciences can somewhat argue either way. Here will be where Im attacked but for example. a) Monogamy is biologically not something we the human animal were built for. Prostitution would be safer for everyone involved if it was legalized and able to function in a free market atmosphere. Drug enforcement law is ultimately bad for the human race, from a strictly scientific view I hypothesize that if all were legal substance abuse and alcoholism would ultimately decrease or lead to less accidental deaths by free market sales. Cold heart as it may sound I realize that would make extreme addicts overdose and die rather quickly. That from a logical view also means that although we may lose our loved ones the human race would over time weed out genetic addiction, addicts die thus they cannot reproduce as much or care for their offspring with the same genetic traits of addiction. So in this I show you how I think you are appalled to the point of agreeing with him that science cant separate itself. He did forget that although the will of the people or churches or the powers that be do alter  actual policy majorly or \"bend\" data to match what they believe (See arguments on gun policy for example) that isnt an example of science being irrational or fictional. It means humanity is irrational and we bring the fiction into the science individually. We ALL believe in something science cant prove because of our religions, values, culture, paychecks, etc. Science cant prove or disprove in a creator, I know that rationally but I hold that the philosophical argument for a First Cause or Prime Mover belief even if its \"illogical\". Like tossing a marble he/she cast it and stepped away....the big bang, evolution, and free will dictate as he/she simply observes. My believes are my own and not proven by science or held by religion but I dont impose them onto anyone. So he had valid points but true objective science and the ones administering it are looking for hard observational truths using a system that is not flawed in such was, The Scientific Method. So what Feyerabend just applied to all science is not the case. I think it should all be viewed as a confounding variable in some science or extrapolation in others. But science that remains pure can be tested again and again and is found to be right or new discoveries prove it wrong using the same process. Science is not broken as he believed...we break science with our beliefs for better or worse.  Thats my two cents on the matter at least but Id like to hear other thoughts provided they stay rational and respectful since my somewhat seemingly hedonistic views will lead to Im sure actual anger. Remember I said it was my theory those would prove to be true and also remember when society thought slavery was acceptable and that women should shut up, cover up, and mind their place (Still socially true for some). Im sure that the initial beginnings of the womens rights movement to change mainstream longstanding opinions was as surprising as the LGBT debates that face us now. So Feyerabend often changed his opinion just like history has proven the \"Hive Mind\" will over time. So please leave out disrespectful comments based on your belief system. I question my own morals, ethics, and beliefs constantly so I hope this will make you question things as well. You cant have a faith or strong ethical/moral stance if its something you've never questioned and wont hear the arguments against. True faith arises in doubt often against the known and logical view. Thanks if you made it this far, -D Again sor...well Im really not sorry if I offended anyone since the point of the forum is to free our minds and find other data and views to add or subtract from our ultimate subjective world view.
