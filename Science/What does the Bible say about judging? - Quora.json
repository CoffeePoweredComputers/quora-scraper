            "answer_text": "Despite the simplicity of this concept, I think the quotation \u201cjudge not lest you be judged\u201d is frequently misunderstood by individuals who don't have a sound theological understanding. In many cases, these individuals might be non-Christians who like to frequently accuse Christians of hypocrisy. I think the word judge in this context means something closer to \u201cdetermining a verdict on someone that might include a punishment\u201d rather than \u201cforming an opinion about the behaviors of others.\u201d When a Christian tells someone else that a certain behavior is wrong, that's not equivalent to \u201cjudging\u201d someone, according to scripture. In fact, Christians are morally obligated to speak out against immoral behavior. To take an extreme example, the two individuals who went on a shooting spree at Columbine High School, in Colorado, were atheists. They were motivated to commit this atrocity due to their hatred of Christians. During their killing spree, they specifically targeted Christians. They asked two girls if they believed in Jesus Christ. The one who said \u201cyes\u201d was shot in the head. The one who said \u201cno\u201d was allowed to go. Imagine if these two atheists had a dialogue with a Christian friend before the shooting: Atheist: \u201cHey, bro, Dylan and I are thinking about shooting up the school in about a week.\u201d Christian: \u201cI think that's wrong and that you shouldn't do it. The Bible says you shouldn't kill.\u201d Atheist: \u201cThe Bible also says \u2018judge not, lest ye be judged,\u2019 you hypocrite. Are you judging us, bro?\u201d Christian: \u201cI believe the King James Version of the Bible states that. I prefer the Catholic Revised Standard Version of the Bible.\u201d Atheist: \u201cStop being a smart ass. You were judging us and you're god says don't judge. Your a hypocrite.\u201d Christian: \u201cI just shared my opinion. I wasn't judging you. I think that shooting up the school would be wrong. How is sharing an opinion from a Christian perspective equivalent to hypocrisy?\u201d Atheist: \u201cYour lucky your our friend and play dungeons and dragons with us. Otherwise, I'd shoot you in the face right now.\u201d Atheist 2: \u201cYeah, he\u2019s, like, the only cool Christian we know.\u201d Christian: \u201cWhatever, I hope you guys are just joking. You're both sick in the head. Hey, it's my turn to be Dungeon Master next Friday night, a week from now, right?\u201d Atheist: \u201cAh, actually, we rescheduled that Dungeons and Dragons session to five days from now. We're going to play hookie, skip school, and just play Dungeons and Dragons all day.\u201d Atheist 2: \u201cYeah, we already forged a doctor\u2019s note that looks like it was written by your mom. Here you go. Just stay home that day. We\u2019ll meet you at your house.\u201d Christian: \u201cAwesome, guys. Thanks!\u201d Informing someone on the moral code contained in the New Testament isn't the equivalent of judging them. I think that word \u201cjudgement\u201d in the context of the New Testament Koine Greek logically involves an earthly punishment coupled with a specific \u201cjudgement.\u201d For example, Jesus saved the adulterous woman from the \u201cjudgement\u201d of death by stoning (the act of throwing rocks at her until she died). To simplify, my Christian interpretation of \u201cdo not judge\u201d is to not throw rocks at people. Pointing out sinful behavior, from a Christian theological perspective, doesn't qualify as \u201cjudging\u201d someone. ",

            "answer_text": "I know a lot of Christians get this wrong First we are to Judge Righteous judgement \u201cJudge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.\u201dJohn\u202c 7:24\u202c KJV\u202c\u202c \u201cnot according to your appearance\u201d not what you do or how you act\u201d thats the thing you are supposed to judge but it\u2019s not the judge that most Christians tend to confuse there are only two groups of people and NO in between either one is righteous or one is in sin, either one is saved or one is lost, God doesn\u2019t see a middle, and this is the problem, Christians tend to judge the flesh or carnal minded instead of righteous judgement to judge Righteous Judgement is not to to judge other Christians nor is it to judge individual sins separately, meaning a lost person who\u2019s let\u2019s say \u201cgay\u201d the fact that he\u2019s gay doesn\u2019t say anything because God judges all sin, that person isn\u2019t going to hell because of 1 sin he\u2019s going to hell because of ALL the sins in his flesh he commits daily so how do you know if one is righteous? It\u2019s simple, you\u2019re saved by the blood of the lamb, that\u2019s it, nothing you do, have done, or will do saves you, the only way you become righteous is by putting your full trust in Jesus Christ and his sacrifice on the cross for the remission of sins, that way his righteousness is imputed unto you \u201cAnd be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:\u201d Philippians\u202c 3:9\u202c KJV\u202c\u202c so when someone is judging righteously they are seeing, is this person a saved person or lost person, is he saved by the blood of the lamb or is he still in his sins, that is it! a secondary judgment is also judging the fruit they bear which goes directly in line with judging righteously fruit is \u201ccorrect doctrine\u201d that is grounded in Christ for instance when Christians use \u201cjudging\u201d To judge Christians it is NOT correct judgement and it is bad fruit because the fruit or doctrine isn\u2019t grounded in Christ, it is false doctrine, when someone judges righteously he can see who is still thinking about their flesh and themselves instead of what Christ has done and his sacrifice on the cross for us Unrighteous is when someone preaches bad fruit they are wolves in sheep clothing, they\u2019re preaching a false gospel that goes directly against what Christ preached and what the church preached. \u201cBut the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d 1 Samuel\u202c 16:7\u202c KJV\u202c\u202c ",
