            "answer_text": "Contrary to what you might think science is not a fully functional meritocracy. Much depends on pure dumb luck and patronage. You can have all the right qualifications, work hard and do all the right things and your number might simply never come up. I would say that only a minority get their jobs via advertisement - application - shortlist- interview - appoint. Most get their jobs through internal advertisement and by nomination. It took me 25\u201330y to realise that. I felt a complete fool. I got my first real job when I was 60y old and it was by nomination. I was offered a job without asking and I took it. By the way do not believe stories about upcoming shortages of scientists. It is a cynical lie to keep up the supply of graduate students. For most, getting your masters or PhD is a termination of employment and a post-doc is merely a reprieve. It is all a Ponzi scheme. It is also a situation where your intelligence and rationality works against you - you cannot understand that your obvious ability and talent will not be recognised and rewarded. The rejection notice of the last open advertisement I even applied for (2010) proudly informed me they had 400 applicants. ",

More money, better lab, more likely to get results.Interact with other fields. You will find new ideas and someone in another field may have a methodology to solve your research problem.Be humble. Learn that we really don\u2019t know much.Don\u2019t burnout. New discoveries are hard. Take a long term view.Don\u2019t take sides. Don\u2019t get into politics in school or the field.Keep reading and studying. Don\u2019t be lazy on your studying.Reputation matters. Be nice to everyone. Don\u2019t screw anyone.",
