            "answer_text": "UV is effective as a disinfectant. Ozone however, has never been acknowledged as safe by the FDA. They discourage its use but there is no outright ban. I happen to agree with their concerns. I would never use an ozone air purifier that adds ozone to the air you breath. If it\u2019s contained in a device that re circulates the air inside and contains it I have no issue with that. The argument that a thunderstorm creates more ozone than these machines and we tolerate that, is no argument at all. We are only occasionally exposed to high levels of ozone in the few thunderstorms we may experience in a year. Exposing yourself to it for many hours a day is quite another thing. ",
