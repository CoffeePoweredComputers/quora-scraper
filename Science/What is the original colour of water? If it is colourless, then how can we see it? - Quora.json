            "answer_text": "We may not find \u2018pure water\u2019 in nature. The water we get to see around us contains dissolved chemicals and suspended matter. Water \u2013 even pure water \u2013 is not colourless. There is a hint of blue - easily observed when you look though a large amount of water \u2013 like in a swimming pool or a lagoon. Water molecules absorb the long waves of light \u2013 towards the red end of the spectrum \u2013 and hence the blueness. This is very well explained here. At best we can say that water is transparent \u2013 that is, it lets light pass through. You may ask then, \u201cair is transparent too but we cannot see it\u201d. We see water because the molecules absorb, refract and reflect light. In air, the nitrogen and oxygen gas molecules are spread far apart, (Density of water is 1000 kg/m\u00b3 and air is 1.225 kg/m\u00b3) so don't interact with light, letting it pass right through. ",

            "answer_text": "You can see water if the surface is open . This is due to reflection of light from the surface that is never steady due to microscopic ripples . If the water were to be very clean, filled in a plain glass vessel that is also very clean and plain, if the surface is not visible, you will not be able to make out whether there is water or not .
