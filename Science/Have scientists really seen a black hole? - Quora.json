            "answer_text": "Dont let the name fool you ,a black hole is anythying but an emoty space.Rather than it is a great amount of matter packed i to a very small area- think of a star 20 times more massive than the sun squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of newyork city.The result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing not even light can escape.In recent years NASA instruments have painted a new picture of these strange objects that are too many the most fantastic objects in space. Scientist can't directly observed black hole with telescopes that detect X-rays. light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. We can however infer the presence of black holes and study them by detecting their effect on on the matter nearby. If a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter for example it will draw matter inward in a process known as acceleration. Similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to a black hole. In this case the black hole can tear the star apart as it pulls it towards itself. As the attracted matter accelerates and heats up it emits X rays that radiate into space. Recent discoveries offer some tantalizing evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on the neighborhoods around them -emitting powerful Gamma ray burst devouring nearby stars and spurring the growth of the new stars in some areas while storing it on others. the idea of an object in space so massive and then that light could not escape it has been around for centuries. Most famously black holes were predicted bye Einstein's theory of general relativity which showed that when the massive star dies it live behind a small dense remnant Core. If the course mass is more than about three times the mass of sun the equations showed the force of gravity overwhelmsthe forces and produces a blackhole  ",

            "answer_text": "   If you asking that scientists  have actually 'seen' a black hole then the answer is NO they have not because it is impossible to 'see' a black hole since the whole concept of a black hole is that photons cannot escape from its event horizon because of extreme gravity . But we know they are there because of the effects it has on its neighbourhood.   \u200b\u200b\u200b The actual experimental observation carried out towards the centre of our galaxy proved that there was a black hole there because the stars near the centre were orbiting around nothing ( i.e.  no photons were observed from a small region of space). Hence it was proved that something that massive to have that much impact on its surroundings and to emit no photon must be a black hole. ",

            "answer_text": "Black holes have infinite gravity, even light is cannot escape from it, so it looks black & it is very difficult to find out the black holes. But they gives proof of their existence by the infinite gravity, inside the galaxy, their is a very high gravitational force, that is balanced the whole galaxy, it is nothing but the supermassive black hole. Black holes can predicted by the light of nearby stars, when a star is going closer to the black hole, it is pulled by the black hole & its matter is revolving around the black hole & creates the acceleration disk, which can be observed. When 2 black holes are collide, due to their intense gravity, they creates ripples in space time, which makes the gravitational waves, this gravitational waves are detected by the humans, by the gravitational detector. So that are the proofs of the existence of black holes. I hope you'll find your way, Bye. ",
