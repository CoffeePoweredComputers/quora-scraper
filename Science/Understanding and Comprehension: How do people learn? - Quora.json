            "answer_text": "People learn in 3 ways:  from reading. We don't necessarily gain understanding on a deep level, but we have a superficial knowing that's sufficient to pass an exam or be temporarily motivated to an actionfrom listening or watching others. The understanding is deeper on  this level, because we have to draw own conclusions, form opinionsfrom experience derived from the above 2 over time. I like to call it \"time learning\". Have you ever heard someone say \"If I knew then what I know now\", that's time learning. While the first 2 are important, the 3rd one truly matters. You can not speed up the process, you need to let time elapse.  A 10 year old can superficially try to get the knowledge of a 20 year old, but until he has lived those 10 extra years, experienced what a person encounters in those years he can not have the actual wisdom.  Same goes for a 20 yr old vs. 30, 30 vs. 40, 40 vs. 50 etc.  Some learning is more difficult than other, due to some curve balls in upbringing, close interpersonal relationships, cultural or social dogma. The learning and understanding will still happen, but it will take slightly more time. Not everyone that reached a certain age has acquired wisdom. Some people will lack the opportunity, or will be prohibited by others to gain knowledge. Those people however will  develop common sense that will surpass other mortals'.  Learning and understanding are only part of wisdom. Correct interpretation, and the ability to apply it to one's life brings true wisdom.    ",
