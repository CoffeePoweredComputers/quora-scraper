            "answer_text": "Well, by definition, a solvent is a liquid that dissolves a solid, liquid or gaseous solute. A solute is a substance dissolved in another substance. A solute and a solvent make up a solution. The solute is usually present in a smaller amount than the solvent. Based on the last part of this definition, the solute is less than 50% of the mix (49.999\u2026%). So, one can say there is less than 50% of the solute in solution. And there has to be some solute present so more than 0%. Best I can do is give you a range, more than 0% and less than 50%. ",
