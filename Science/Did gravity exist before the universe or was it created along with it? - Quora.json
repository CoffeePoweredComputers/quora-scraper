            "answer_text": "The creation of gravitational field occurred when energy made the jump to the G2 Gordon Energy State. The G2 Gordon Energy State is when G = 2 in the GOD Equation:  A particle with E2 energy associated with mass (m2) existing in the E0 energy of spacetime must create a gravitational field. There is no way around it. The universe existed before the big bang where all the energy in the universe was E0 energy in the form of a 2D spatial dimensional spacetime of the parallel planar universe. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything shows that once G2 particles are created, they must contain mass (No Higgs Boson required for assembly). The reason why all the newly created matter in the universe was able to be forced outward was because there was a force much stronger than gravity and that was the E0 energy gradient in the newly form 3D spacetime created during the big bang. Over time the huge E0 energy gradient decreased and the E0 energy gradient of gravity was able to pull adjacent nearby particles containing mass together. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything provides the missing foundation on which all of physics needs to be rebuilt on. ",

Like a woman, it wants to be known, but it is not going to just write all about itself in a book so we can just read it and know. No, the universe is there plain as the sun, waiting to be figured out; but astro-cosmo-science just can not understand her/it, yet. Gravity is a force, and it is reliant on mass/volume of matter to give rise to it-gravity. Gravity is king in my ToE. And perhaps the big bang happened as no remaining gravitational objects were outside the one remaining singular mass, causing a reaction-explosion-spreading. Gravity is different than light in that gravity does not curve etc, nor does gravity get bent back to \u2018no escape\u2019 as light does at an event horizon of a black hole: gravity effects light yet light has little effect on gravity. Science claims gravity and light have the same speed, yet, perhaps they just can\u2019t see gravity act any faster than light allows it observed. Perhaps gravity can be faster than light while science\u2019s (misunderstanding) postulate of light says \u2018nothing is faster than the speed of light\u2019. To simplify the universe, I think of just a few priorities, 1-matter=mass, 2-gravity, 3- proximity-location; the rest is elementary/chess\u2026..and Gravity is king. douG ",

            "answer_text": "Conventionally its theorized that Gravity is the result of mass in space \u201cwarping the space time fabric\u201d , resulting in time dilation around the object resulting in what we know as gravity. So the question goes back to that old saying \u201cif a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to here it does it make a sound?\u201d Well in the case, if the theory holds and there was only one singular mass of super dense energy before the Big Bang the gravity would only have existed in the minute point in space and no where else. BUT we know now that what gravity is and what is appears to be could be different, as we have other forces almost twin to gravity like centrifugal force which exists even in deep space non effected by super massive bodies where you will still experience a force acting upon you when you move relative to your motionless point in space, plenty of experiments done on the ISS where they are in microgravity. So if not gravity still something( which I believe to be the same force) is acting upon this universe even when gravity, as conventionally thought, would not be taking place. ",

Energy cannot be created, it has no time. Gravity is not a force, it\u2019s an effect of rolling space which forces everything to be on a convergence course. Imagine two entities aware of each other but not aware of their sideways motion toward a common, distant convergence point. They will both be convinced of some mysterious force drawing them toward each other. To get a better grasp of this principle, please view this animated video:  ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing existed before the big bang (as far as we know) and I would really like to clarify what I mean by nothing. When I use the word nothing, I mean it in the most literal sense. When you go into outer space, you are in a vacuum. Everything is black and you can see starts off into the distance. There is no atmosphere, this is what most people think of when they here the word nothing; this is not what I mean. In a vacuum, there is still space-time, quantum fluctuations, spatial dimensions, forces such as gravity. Before the big bang, there was none of this. I would also like to clarify what dimensions are. The amount of dimensions = the amount of coordinates you need to specify a unique point in space.  The picture above illustrates spatial dimensions, our universe only has three of these (as far as we know). Before the big bang, there was none of this. Even asking what it looked like before the big bang is meaningless because there was nothing there to look at, no space for anything to exist in. ",
