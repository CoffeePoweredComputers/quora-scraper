            "answer_text": "You've made it halfway, with your analysis. The SOM can indeed by consumed and broken down by Archaea, fungi, flagellates, protozoa, and bacteria, which all prey on each other and compete with each other and form symbiotic relationships with each other. Yet, many also form symbiotic relationships with plants. Her is where the next part of the story comes in. For example, mycorrhizal fungi will attach to plant roots, and functionally extend the root zone of the plant 10, 100, or even 1000 times in three dimensions. This relationship allows mycorrhizal fungi to provide water and minerals to the plant, in exchange for sugars which the plant photosynthesizes using the sun, and carbon dioxide. The plant grows and grows, and then goes seasonally dormant, and drops leaves or mast; is killed by cold weather or dies after reseeding, and drops the entire structure; or in tropical regions perennially drops lower leaves and mast and grows taller and wider before death many years later (sometimes hundreds of years later). When this seasonal \u201clittle death\u201d, or ultimate demise occurs, the plant vegetation and structure becomes the mulch that feeds the soil food web, the Archaea, fungi, flagellates, protozoa, and bacteria. The cycle gets even more interesting when you add animals to the mix. Herbivores eat vegetable matter, and ultimately poop it out and move on. The poop feeds the soil food web in very important ways. In grasslands and savannahs, ruminants such as bison or water buffalo or now domesticated cows eat a munch of grass here, a bite of grass there, and move on. If there are predators, or humans, to keep the ruminants moving and to keep them from returning to previously-grazed areas, the grass will be grazed to a length about 1/2 to 2/3 of what was there. Under the soil surface, the roots will slough off by a similar amount, meaning that the roots will die off to 1/2 to 2/3 of the previous root ball. Keep in mind that roots, themselves, are made of carbon. This die-back of roots enriches the soil with more carbon. Actually, many trees go through a similar die-back seasonally, with their carbon-rich roots adding organic matter back into soil. In this way, the soil food web feeds plants, which plants feed the soil food web, and animals can supercharge the cycle. The conflict between microbial activity and soil organic matter occurs most often as a result of tillage. Tillage adds a ton of oxygen into the mix, as well as breaks up fungal mineral-distribution networks. This artificially selects for a type of bacteria that loves aerobic conditions, and these get supercharged with a competitive advantage over the other microbes. One of their byproducts is nitrogen, which is why tillage helps fast-germinating and fast-growing annuals such as cereal crops, but also why partway through the year, more nitrogen is needed as these microbes burn through their feedstock. Adding nitrogen in the form of fertilizer further selects for these bacteria, as fewer microbes can help plants use it. Farmers love increased organic matter, but tillage breaks down the larger glues and aggregates that comprise organic matter, and the increased oxygen burns (oxidizes), with the help of microbes, stored carbon away into co2. In this way, soils become denuded of organic matter by both microbes and oxidation as a result of tillage. ",

            "answer_text": "The long answer is 30 hours of lectures on soil microbiology. The short answer is that in normal circumstances a highly active soil microbiology is beneficial to plants. Many of the microbes form symbiotic relationships with plants, some are commensal and a very few are pathogenic. Unless the plants are very tender, e.g newly emerged seedlings, they do not benefit from sterile growing media and may even underperform because of it. ",
