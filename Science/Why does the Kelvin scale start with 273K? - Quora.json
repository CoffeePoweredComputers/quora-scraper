            "answer_text": "The lowest recorded temperature on earth is -273 (to be accurate, -273.15) degree celcius. As kelvin is the SI unit of temperature which is mostly used by scientists, thus it was to be made simple and easy. Kelvin= 273+Celcius. Thus the lowest temperature cannot come in negative Kelvin, as -273 degree celcius= 273+(-273) kelvin = 0 kelvin. Thus, -1 kelvin is not known till now. Thus, the kelvin scale starts from 273K (0 degree celcius). PS:- If helpful, please upvote. :) ",
