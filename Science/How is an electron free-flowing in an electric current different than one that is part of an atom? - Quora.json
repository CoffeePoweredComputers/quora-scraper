            "answer_text": "An atom is always neutral. When it is not the case, when a high frequency photon had the strength to eject one electron, this is such a shock that it brake any chemical bond. The reason uv, x ray and gamma ray are all cancerigenous is precisely because they cut the long DNA molecule in two segments which damage the encoded information. Brief, for an atom missing an electron, the first priority is to capture another electron. The atom will abandon it's location in the molecule, attracted by the highest gradient of negative charge. Meanwhile, a lonely electron will start moving toward the gradient of positive field created by this ionized atom. Since an electron is 1823 times lighter, it will do most of the physical motion, reach the highest speed, but on our macroscopic scale, we just detect the atom moving a little, not the electron moving a lot. That is why all electronic schematic indicate diodes and transistors like arrow pointing in the wrong direction. Back to the question:How an electron free flowing in an electric current\u2026 How a water molecule free flowing in a river differ from a water molecule frozen in ice? Now that we understand what makes ice slippery, the comparison becomes more appropriate. Why? Because the actual answer in both cases turns out to be more complicated then first expected, but so much more satisfying. Search for Steve Mould and okay to be smart on YouTube for ice. Extrapolate from there for electric current in metal from physics books and keep an open mind for the real answer being similarly complicated. Upvote for opening your mind. I didn't answer the question but provided an example to show the direction to look for the answer. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is ill-posed as it assumes electrons behave the same in all materials, when subject to inducing em fields, which is not the case. see https://rpi.edu/dept/phys/Dept2/ScIT/Fran/OLD/TiplerMoscaPhsics5ech38.pdf https://www.webassign.net/ebooks/krane3demo/pdf/chapter11.pdf Also current is not the flow of electrons but rather the induction and propagation of em fields within which electrical energy is stored and carried. In materials which are conductors, free electrons, play a major role, in em wave propagation by allowing a change in a quantum state, photon emission and subsequent wave propagation but the electron itself only changes state and does not itself propagate but rather mover at drift velocity within the material or \u201csea of electron gas\u201d.
