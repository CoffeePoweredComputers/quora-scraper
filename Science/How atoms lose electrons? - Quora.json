            "answer_text": "Each atom is made up of protons neutrons and electron. Protons and neutrons are in the centre known as nucleus and electron revolve around the nucleus in certain path known as orbits and these orbits have certain energy level which go s on increasing as we move outside the atom from inside. The electrons in the last or valence shell are weakly attracted to the protons so if another atom of high electron affinity comes there then the electron in the valence shell is attracted to the other atom and this is how the first atom loses its electron to the other atom ",

            "answer_text": "The cause is that an electron has procured enough vitality (through the retention of a photon) to break free from the hold of the nuclear core, or has been followed up on by a power more noteworthy than the electron's fascination in the core. The outcome is that the iota gets a positive charge and turns into a particle. Ordinarily, this happens when the molecule has one electron in its most astounding vitality level; it surrenders the electron with the goal that it will have a full external shell (the shell underneath the shell that had stand out electron), a more steady condition. The lost electron ordinarily is given to a particle that was one electron shy of a full external shell. ",

            "answer_text": "Atom loses electron only when it absorbs energy sufficient, enough to work against the electrostatic attraction between nucleus and the concerned electron! Remember: Energy is the capacity to do work! And work is (mathematically) force x displacement, so having supplied energy to an atom, and if it absorbs that energy then, atom had to do work, and it does work by knocking out to electron. ",

            "answer_text": "High ionization energy means that it is hard to lose electrons. Low ionization energy means that it easy to lose electrons. The elements on the left side lose their electrons fairly easily and the elements on the right side of the periodic table do not lose their electrons very easily. Taking vertical position on the table into account,the elements that are lower on the table lose electrons more easily and the elements that are higher have a harder time losing electrons. Thus the overall trend is from most easily losing electrons on the lower left to least easily losing electrons on the upper right. ",
