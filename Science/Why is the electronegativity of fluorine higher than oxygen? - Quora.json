            "answer_text": "Fluorine has a smaller atomic radius than oxygen. This is because the outermost electron is shielded from the nucleus by the same number of full inner electron shells (thus the shielding is the same) but the proton number of fluorine is higher meaning that the outermost electron is closer to the nucleus (as the nucleus is more positively charged) and at a lower energy level (has a lower intrinsic energy) so there is a greater electrostatic force of attraction between the outer electron and the nucleus. This means that the size of fluorine's electron cloud is smaller, and it has a greater ability/tendancy to attract a bonding pair of electrons (thus a higher electronegativity) than oxygen as it has a higher nuclear charge and a smaller atomic radius. Fluorine is actually more electronegative than any other element because it has the greatest nuclear charge:atomic radius ratio (it's nuclear charge is large relative to its atomic radius) meaning that any electrons in a covalent or ionic bond with fluorine will experience a greater \u2018pull' from the positively charged nucleus of the fluorine atom than that of the other atom in the bond, meaning that they will lie closer to to fluorine atom that the other atom.

            "answer_text": "Well, fluorine, [math]Z=9[/math], has a higher nuclear charge than oxygen, [math]Z=8[/math]. And we know that electronegativity INCREASES ACROSS a Period from left to right as we face the Table (of course, the electronegativities of the Noble gases are not normally quoted\u2026) So, while across a Period, a horizontal row of the Periodic Table, electronegativity INCREASES from left to right as we face the Table \u2026 due to the increased nuclear charge \u2026. but down a Group, a vertical column of the Table, electronegativity DECREASES due to the shielding on nuclear charge\u2026 As always, we define [math]\\text{electronegativity}[/math] as the ability of an atom involved in a chemical bond to polarize electron density towards itself .. And so the electronegatvity of fluorine in its compounds is ENHANCED with respect to that of oxygen. And for the REAL molecule, [math]OF_{2}[/math], we got oxidation numbers of [math]O(+II)[/math], and [math]F(-I)[/math]. In the real molecule, [math]F-O-O-F[/math], we got [math]O(+I)[/math] \u2026 and this is foof by name, and foof by nature\u2026 ",
