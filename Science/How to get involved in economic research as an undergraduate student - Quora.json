            "answer_text": "In my experience there are 3 very important things you will need to do. 1: Talk to you professors. No matter how qualified you are to do research you need someone experienced in the field to help you both develop good research topics and actually execute a research project. 2: Take an Econometrics class as soon as possible. It is the most important class you will take in undergrad for doing research in econ hands down. Every other field of econ (beyond pure theory which you won\u2019t do as an undergrad or ever) will require some measure of Econometric analysis. 3: Take higher level Math and/or Computer Sciences classes in addition to you econ curriculum. Math is exceptionally important in econ and an understanding of topics like Analysis or Graph Theory can help with many topics in econ. For Computer Science, having an understanding of how to program at a basic level can help with both gathering and analyzing data for your research project. Hope this helps and good luck getting published! ",
