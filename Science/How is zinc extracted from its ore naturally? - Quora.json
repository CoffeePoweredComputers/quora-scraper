            "answer_text": "Stage 1 The low concentrations of the zinc sulphide mineral in most zinc ores mean that the ore must first be concentrated before extracting the metal The zinc blende (sphalerite: zinc sulphide)is first crushed to powder and then treated by froth flotation (that process is described in the copper unit. It is used in the extraction of several metals). Tjhe resulting material is known as 'concentrate'. It contains at least 50% zinc Stage 2 Sintering The next stage involves heating the concentrate in air. The sulphur oxidises toproduce sulphur dioxide and the zinc becomes zinc oxide: 2ZnS + 3O2 -> 2ZnO +2SO2 Stage 3 Metal production The zinc oxide is then reduced to the metal using either a thermal or an electrolytic process Thermal smelting The crude zinc oxide is heated with coke (carbon) at 1,000\u00baC. The zinc metal formed by the reaction ZnO + C ->Zn(vapour) + CO(gas) is in vapour form since zinc, unusually for a metal, boils at the relatively low temperature of 907\u00baC. The zinc vapour is condensed in the absence of air, so that it does not re-oxidise back to zinc oxide. Zinc produced by this process is about 98.5% pure and can be further refined if required Around 15% of the world's zinc is produced this way Electrolytic refining The crude zinc oxide is dissolved in sulphuric acid to produce a solution of znc sulphate After filtration and purification the solution is then electrolysed using a lead anode and an aluminium cathode. Zinc is deposited on the cathode. Sulphuric acid is regenerated at the anode and can be used again. The zinc is stripped periodically from the cathode melted and cast into blocks (ingots) for many different purposes,. Electrolytically refined zinc is generally 99.995% pure. About 80% of the world's zinc is produced using this process. ",
