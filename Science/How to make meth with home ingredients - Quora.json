            "answer_text": "You don't, sunshine. A few reasons why: The actual chemical reactions involved are quite dangerous. A little too much X or heat Y a little too long and you and explosion with bonus toxins. This is true in a house or in a proper laboratory, but a house is not equipped with the sort of hardware to make these reactions safe under any circumstances.Making methamphetamine from chemicals readily available to the general public involves altering the chemical makeup of many of these chemicals. These are reactions separate from actually making methamphetamine, which is really quite simple with access to certain tightly-controlled chemicals. None of these reactions are going to be entirely \u201cclean\u201d; you are not working with pure chemicals and there will be chemical byproducts that you would not expect - even if you were doing this from the perspective of a seasoned chemist. These chemicals will interfere with actually making the meth, and they will contaminate it with everything from random carcinogens to heavy metals.There is no good reason to make meth at home. If it's purely for profit, the product will be crap and you will be exposing yourself to the absolute horrorshow that is small-scale slinging. If it's for personal use, then you are definitely poisoning yourself (far worse than with a \u201ccleaner\u201d lab meth), assuming you didn't hurt yourself during the cook. It is difficult to use meth if you've blown off a hand, blinded yourself, suffered chemical and thermal burns to significant portions of your body, dissolved parts of your lungs and/or sinuses, or done other permanent damage to yourself. I guarantee that each of these things happens, and on a regular basis, in home cooks.Using methamphetamine is bad. There is some debate to be had here, people have made some great arguments as to why it can be used under certain circumstances for good reason. Even if every single one of these arguments is true, you're only looking at a tiny, tiny portion of users. Almost everyone who uses it destroys their lives very rapidly.TL;DR Making meth at home is dangerous. Don't use meth. Edited for typo. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not worth the hassle or risk. Manufacturing is a 20-year mandatory charge at 20% that's 4 years to the board. You can buy it cheaper than you can make it. I've had good shake and thought I made decent shake myself, but for the effort to make 2 to 3 gs it's not worth it. I took 5 yrs for having lithium batteries, draino crystals, and a small pocket pipe cutter. I had no bottles with cake, no meth at all. I got charged for attempted precursors, that's the shitty thing about living in a commonwealth state, they make up laws as they go. There's no shake comparable to super lab ice unless you find a cook willing to use red phosphorus and that's a shitty long process to perform for maybe a good product. I was never able to be consistent with it but you can't hope for much shaking a Gatorade bottle. I've never made more than 2 gs a box. The day I pulled 2.4 gs off the second pull of filter dope I decided I'll leave it to the people who are better than me. The only reason I did it was because the girl I was seeing got prescription Claritin D. It's not hard to do, the problem is not knowing what to do if you have a bottle blow up. The first time I tried it I poured a cap of water right on the lithium, thank God the bottle was in the kitchen sink it only burned my girlfriend's moms curtains down. I was really lucky I got it capped off again. It ruined 3 hrs of labor hustling up ingredients. I've given the recipe on here before, but it's gonna cost you 20.00 for Liquid Fire, 7,00 for Draino Crystals. 5,00 for a cold pack if you can even find them with ammonia nitrates now. The batteries are 5,00 medicine 20.00 to 40.00 lighter fluid 3.00 salt is cheap and the hoses are cheap too. You can get an 8 Ball for 70. Why risk it? ",
