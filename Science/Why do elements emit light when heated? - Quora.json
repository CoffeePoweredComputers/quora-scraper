            "answer_text": "When elements (matter) are heated, its atoms increase in vibration in inverse proportion to its mass. The weakest particles joined to the atoms by electro-static force, ie photons, are first emitted by that increased vibration. Photons make up the radiation and light that you see, not electrons. If the vibration becomes higher even electrons can be emitted as plasma (external to surface) or as an electric flow (internal with an induced voltage) . ",
