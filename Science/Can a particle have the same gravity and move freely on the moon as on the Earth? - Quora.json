            "answer_text": "Well, as long as the word gravity is concerned no object can ever have same gravity as on earth even it is an identical structure to the earth with same dimensions. Because GRAVITY is the term defined specifically for the force of gravitation exerted by Earth on any object. And for the second part force of gravitation exerted by Earth is different than that of moon so your object might not move similarly on the moon for same applied force, however similar motion can be obtained by applying appropriate external force.
