            "answer_text": "Other answers describe the work for hire model for textbooks. Many textbooks are not done as work for hire; instead, authors earn royalties based on book sales. I have experience with the royalty payment model. For my intermediate to advanced statistics textbook: I was not paid an advance on royalties (some authors are paid advances for textbooks or other kinds of writing). I worked for 8 years to write the first edition of the book and make revisions based on outside reviewer input. I didn\u2019t receive any hourly compensation for the nights, weekends, holidays, and summers I put into that. My contract royalty rates were 10% for the first 2000 books and 15% for sales beyond 2000 copies (this was purely theoretical, however; I never sold more than 2000 copies in a year). Costs of indexing and some permissions to reprint some figures were deducted from early royalties (this varies depending on the author/publisher contract terms). I am not clear what happens when my publisher rents my textbook as an ebook (at rates sometimes as low as $26.00 a semester). $2.60 per rental may be all I get. Price for the hardcover book has also varied over time. Like all other authors, I earn nothing when my books are resold as used. Most textbooks earn very little and are quickly discontinued. My book has earned enough that a 3rd edition is now in the works. A few superstar authors wrote widely adopted textbooks used in introductory courses (such as Paul Samuelson\u2019s Economics) and probably become wealthy from book royalties. For most textbook authors, royalties are a small supplement to income (not enough to quit the day job). Major changes are taking place in textbook publishing. Open access/ free textbooks are becoming available (these are written as one time fee for service). In my own field the quality of these open access books, at least so far, could best be described as adequate. I don\u2019t mean the books provide incorrect information. They just don\u2019t explain things in clear or engaging ways. Some textbook publishers now promote one-time-use license codes that give students on line access to course materials they must have for course work, including required on line quizzes. I don\u2019t see this trend as a good thing. A pattern of giving away writing has emerged. Because many people (journalists, bloggers, and some academic content providers) are willing to sell their work for a low price, or even give it away, it becomes increasingly difficult for dedicated writers in many fields to earn any money from their work. The time required to write a really good book represents an opportunity cost to those of us who write (I could have earned money during the nights, weekends, holidays, and summers I devoted to my textbook\u2026 or just had more fun!). And the time investment is a risk. Many books that took people long years to write end up earning trivial sums of money for only a brief time. I do not intend to demean the work of those who write for hire. Many people produce good work. However, there\u2019s less incentive for excellence in that situation. An author who may earn royalties is motivated to write a book that is good enough to sell and continue selling, and knows that she/he needs to do more than just submit an acceptable manuscript that meets specifications on time. I hope that people will continue to find the book I worked on for so many years useful - even if it now competes with free books that provide some of the same information. ",

            "answer_text": "Most textbook authors are paid a flat fee, with no royalties. Part of the reason is that textbooks usually have a lot of authors involved. The company may pay you $1,000 for a short chapter, pay someone else $5,000 for a longer section, and pay someone with a very well-known name $10,000 and put his or her name on the cover. All of their costs are calculated before the textbook comes out, and all of the authors are paid by the time the books hit campuses. ",
