            "answer_text": "The reaction of acetone (CH3)2CO) with bleach (basic sodium hypochlorite, NaOCl) is shown below. (CH3)2CO + 6 NaOCl \u2192 CH3CO2-Na+ + CHCl3 + 2 NaOH + 3 NaCl This is, more or less, a variation of the iodoform reaction which results in the formation of chloroform (CHCl3) as well as sodium acetate (CH3CO2-Na+ ). Chloroform, in the presence of light and oxygen (\u2026left outside for a few days) leads to the formation of phosgene (Cl2CO): CHCl3 + O2 \u2192 Cl3C-OOH Cl3C-OOH + H2O \u2192 Cl3C-OH + HOOHCl3C-OH \u2192 Cl2CO + HCl Phosgene, at low concentration, does smell like freshly mown hay. You should seek medical attention if you are experiencing the following signs - coughing, burning sensation in the throat and eyes, watery eyes, blurred vision, difficulty breathing, and/or nausea and vomiting, Of course, having these symptoms does not mean you were exposed to phosgene but given the circumstances, would be consistent with phosgene exposure. Most people who recover after exposure to phosgene make a complete recovery. However, chronic bronchitis and emphysema have been reported as a result of phosgene exposure. ",
