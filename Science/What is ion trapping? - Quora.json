            "answer_text": "In physics, ion trapping refers to a technique which is used to trap individual ions - even single ones - for an extended period of time. Even more awesome: Once they are trapped, you can cool them with laser light (Nobel Prize 1997 [1]) and do awesome stuff with them! For example, you can observe the formation of so called Coulomb Crystals [2]:  The bright spots are single Be ions, trapped in a linear trap (see further below) and then cooled with laser light at 313nm. Since ions repel each other, and the ones above are trapped and barely move, they form a Coulomb Crystal. Ion traps allow for cutting-edge research in: precision spectroscopy [3]quantum computing [4]and tests of fundamental physics with antimatter. [5]One widely used design to trap ions is the linear ion trap, a variant of the Paul trap, for which Wolfgang Paul received the Nobel Prize in 1989 [6]. The principle is a superposition of electrostatic and electrodynamic electric fields, which creates an effective potential, confining charged particles. Such a trap is placed in an environment with extremely low pressure (mbar), so that no other molecules can collide with the ions. Below you have a view through a window on our vacuum chamber and you can see the trap we assembled:  You can see many wires, which supply the trap electrodes (the horizontally mounted, metallic cylinders in the middle of the picture) with different voltages. Now we need to \u201cload\u201d the trap with ions. There are different techniques to end up with trapped ions of the desired kind. The trap above, for example, is loaded from below: a beam of neutral Beryllium atoms is targeted into the trap center, together with a beam of fast electrons at a different angle. These beams collide with each other in the trap center, which leads to the ionization of the neutral atoms (the fast electrons \u201ckick out\u201d one electron of the Beryllium atoms), so that we end up with trapped Be ions. Of course they are still very hot - which means they move very fast - but they are trapped. This is what many physicists think of when you ask for \u201cion trapping\u201d, I guess.
