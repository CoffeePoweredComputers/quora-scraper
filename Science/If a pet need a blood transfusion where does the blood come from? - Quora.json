            "answer_text": "I am not an expert, but in a story a vet needed a small amount of blood for a dog, I think. Cat is possible. It was the equivalent of a human needing 1 bag, they might be okay without it as the bleeding had been stopped, but they would have been weakened so things were more likely to go . One of the vet\u2019s pets both was the equivalent of O- for the species and was not upset by donating. From what I have read, that checks out. Vets know of cats, dogs, and horses etc, who can either donate on a schedule for the vet to store or whose humans are willing to bring them down when another animal of the same species is going to have surgery. Animals who know they will get enough treats, cuddles, whatever is their favorite currency to make the poke just another strange Human thing that the animal doesn\u2019t need to get upset with anymore. Not as much help when the other animal is hemorrhaging but a single donation from a human can be enough to make the difference to a moderately injured person with a decent team working to clamp the torn arteries.
