            "answer_text": "The question is a bit ambiguous. Is it asking: a. Why does glass reflect light (which could be of different colours)? or b. Why does the light (of some particular colour) reflected off glass come in different colours (from the original)? For a. the short answer is: practically everything will reflect some of the light falling on it. Some light will be absorbed, and some light might pass through it. For b. this would only happen to certain types of \u201cglass\u201d, for example: coated with a thin filmetched with very fine lines or dotsBut if the question is not really specific about reflection, and we consider light that has passed through glass, then it also happens to: glass of particular shapes e.g. a triangular prism, bevelled edge of a mirrorLight is generally made of a range of colours. For example, sunlight is made of all the colours of the rainbow, LED light is made of a few particular colours combined together. These colours can be separated by glass if they get refracted as it passes through the glass (like in a prism) or there is interference. Refraction is the bending of rays of light as it enters the glass from air and when it exits from glass back into the air. It happens because light slows down when it travels in glass. Light behaves like waves, which will change direction when they are slowed down like this:  Credit: Electronics Tutorials, Basic Electronics concepts, Electronics Kits, But different colours slow down different amounts, and hence get turned different amounts. The result is that the colours get separated as the light passes in and out of the glass:  Credit: Light and the Electromagnetic Spectrum - Biology Rocks! Interference is a bit harder to explain. It\u2019s when the waves of light get shifted so that some the peaks and troughs of a light wave are no longer aligned with the next light wave. The combination of these two waves may result in them cancelling each other out, or making the wave stronger. A thin coating on the glass or the presence of tiny pits or grooves on the surface may be just enough to shift the light waves that are reflected so this happens. Then some colours will cancel out and hence \u201cdisappear\u201d, while some colours get stronger. To the viewer, it\u2019s as if the colour has changed.  Credit: Explain that stuff!

            "answer_text": "Your question only makes sense to me if I assume you meant \u201crefract\u201d rather than \u201creflect\u201d. Light passing through glass moves slower than light passing through vacuum. The ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to that in the medium is called the index of refraction. Snell's law explains why this causes light \u201crays\u201d to change direction when they hit glass (from air) at an angle. The index of refraction for a given medium (e.g. glass) depends a little on the frequency of the light. Blue (higher frequency) light is bent more than red (lower frequency) light, hence a prism spreads \u201cwhite\u201d light (a mixture of all visible frequencies) out into a fan of colors. Rainbows work the same way, but are a little more complicated \u2014 they involve refractions and reflections inside a spherical water droplet. ",
