            "answer_text": "There's an interesting bit of a book called Origin by Stephen Baxter, where he posits that an Earth forming absent a moon would, for instance, have significantly faster rotation rates (with accompanying high winds) and a lot more CO2 in the atmosphere, which would boost the temperature, and of course no tides. So the biota in the coastal zone would be different and you'd not have mixing that occurs there.  That said. It is far from clear that anything precludes life forming absent a moon. The question is whether the effects of the moon were significant enough to make it easier for life to form and hang around.  For instance, the moon stabilizes the Earth's axial tilt. We can look at Mars, which hasn't got a moon at all of any size (Phobos and Deimos are basically big rocks, with so little mass that they basically don't affect Mars at all). Mars' axial tilt is about 23 degrees now, similar to Earth, but it might have been all over the place in the past -- on the order of 55 degrees at various points in its history. Axial tilts matter because that's what makes seasons and affects the temperature distribution on Earth, and that matters when life forms are trying to get going. The key thing is stability, not necessarily whether the moon existed or not.  So the moon provides stability in at least one area, but is it necessary? It doesn't seem so, at least from a straight up chemical perspective there isn't anything that the moon does or did, and it isn't large enough to protect the Earth from impacts in a significant way. (Jupiter does that by herding big killer comets and asteroids). So the shorter answer is the moon is not necessary but it's a nice addition to make things easier for living things.  If this sounds wishy washy it's because the answer you're looking for rather depends on what you mean by life. That is, it's entirely possible that simple self-replicating molecules appeared several times in Earth's history before RNA and DNA became the template for future single celled organisms. RNA and DNA based life requires a pretty stable environment and more to the point if you want anything beyond single-celled life you need a certain amount of stability to give life a chance to \"innovate\" and work out multicellular creatures. Absent that stability -- say, an Earth whose axial tilt was all over the place -- you could get all kinds of bacteria but maybe nothing more than that. Nobody really knows, though.  ",

            "answer_text": "This is a really interesting question to ponder. The Moon has been such an important influence on our planet and on humanity that figuring out how things would be different is a great thought experiment. Tides, Waves and Ocean Currents Lets start with the tides as other answers have posed. Tides are formed because the Moons gravity pulls at the Earth. This makes the oceans on either side of the Earth bulge. The Earth spins on its axis beneath the Moon and the tidal bulge moves to stay with the Moon. This is why we get two high tides each day - one from each bulge.  Image: User:Borvan53 - Wikimedia Commons The lunar day (the time it takes for the Moon to appear in the same place) is 24 hours and 50 minutes. You know this because the Moon rises about 50 minutes later each day. This is why the tides are not synchronised with solar days. Tides are also affected by the coriolus effect. This is caused by the spinning of the Earth and the fluidity of the oceans. This creates our great ocean and atmospheric currents. Waves are caused by the movement of air across the surface of water. This is why ocean beaches get higher waves than inlets or lakes. The longer the distance that the wind blows across the water (the reach) the greater the energy it imparts to the water and the bigger the waves. Wind causes waves, not tides or the Moon. Formation of Moon and the Earth The formation of the Moon certainly had an impact on the formation of the Earth. Lets look at the 3 hypotheses about how the Moon was formed: Giant Impact.The prime candidate for the formation of the Moon is the Giant Impact Theory. Something very big (a planet called Theia) slammed into the Earth and the result was a mess of debris that accreted together (by gravity) to create two objects: the Moon and the Earth. Co-creation. The Earth and the Moon formed from the solar system debris at the same time. Capture. The Moon was a rogue object hurtling through the Solar System looking for a home. The Earth captured it in it\u2019s gravity and it\u2019s been here ever since. If either of the first two scenarios are correct, the Earth would be a very different planet if the Moon had not formed. We would be much bigger, gravity would be greater, our orbit around the sun would be slightly faster. I honestly would need to spend too long pondering what differences that would make to our planet and life on Earth. So as we continue, lets suppose that the Earth is the size it is now. If the Capture model is true, and we didn\u2019t capture it, then Moon would likely have been captured by another planet or burned up in the Sun. Geology Coastlines would be dramatically different without the erosion from tides. Tides eat away at cliff faces, and while there would still be waves, the effect of the tide is to move the impact of waves across and area from low to high tides. King tides and storm tides can also have significant local effects on coastlines, moving large amounts of sand out to see or deposit them on other parts of the coastline. Wave action at the same level on the coast may create different coastline shapes. Will beaches still exist? That will require some fancy modelling to find out. Life on Earth It is certainly possible for life on Earth to form in oceans without tides. But there would certainly be ecosystems on Earth that would certainly be different: Estuaries. Those places where the river meets the sea would function differently without tides. Tides often result in changes in channels in sandy estuaries. It\u2019s possible that estuaries would be more stable without tides. It\u2019s also likely that blockages would form, changing the landscape of the area behind the coast. Intertidal zones. These are important areas for fish nurseries, moluscs and other sea creatures. The evolution of plants and animals would be quite different if the constant actions of the tides were not in play. Coral reefs. Coral and coral reef dwellers have adapted to the constant changes in depth and the difference in the pressure and light changes throughout the day. Our snorkeling experience may be quite different. These are three important ecosystems that are dependent on tides. Humans There are several ways in which the development of the human species would be affected. by not having a Moon. Our Calendar. Honestly, without the Moon our annual calendar might make more sense. We might divide the year up into equal groupings of days, and never have to remember if August has 30 or 31 days. We\u2019d still need a leap year because this is related to our journey around the Sun. Evolutionary Migration. Early humans navigated with the stars and used the light from the Moon to travel at night. I wonder how different our journey out of Africa to all other parts of the world might have been if we were not able to travel at night. Astronomy. Understanding the cycles of the Moon was an important discovery in the history of astronomy and led to further discoveries about the nature of the Solar System, orbital mechanics, and even the nature of the Sun\u2019s corona from the study of Solar Eclipses. Galileo drew the first images of the Moon through a telescope and noted it\u2019s mountains and craters. Mapping the Moon in increasing detail continues today.  Space Exploration. Without the Moon the first steps of space exploration get very difficult. I\u2019m not sure that humans could have generated the same ambition about going to Mars. Though if we had, we\u2019d be more advanced now. The Night Sky The Moon is one of the great naked eye objects in the night sky. It changes every day. It is complicated in its movements and it creates incredible visions such as solar and lunar eclipses. The Moon is an easy target for amateur astronomers and full of extraordinary detail, and changing landscapes. The Moon has been at the heart of storytelling, mythology and nursery rhymes. Without it our sky would be dark and unreachable. The Moon creates a kind of stepping stone to the stars, for ancient astronomers, space explorer and stargazers. It\u2019s part of our humanity, and without it we\u2019d be different.  If you want to observe the Moon, get my Naked Eye Observer\u2019s Checklist and some free email astronomy lessons. ",
