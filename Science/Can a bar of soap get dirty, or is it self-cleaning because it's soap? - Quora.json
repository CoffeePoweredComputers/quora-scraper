            "answer_text": "The bar of soap will retain some of the dirt that was on your hands. It will not self clean. However, it generally allows that once you are done using it, you rinse your hands which will then wash off any remaining contaminants because they are now trapped in the soap that you have on your hands. If you also rinse off the soap bar before you put it back, you can clean if off fairly well too. We use soap dispensers in our house to eliminate the need for those \u2018dirty\u2019 bars of soap. However, even these might spread contaminants as we all have to touch the same handle to pump out the soap. Some commercially supplied soap dispensers are automatic. They sense your hand and pump out a dollop of soap onto your hand without you touching anything. These are the closest to a perfect non-infecting method of supplying soap. Generally, we rely on very thorough rinsing with running water to wash off any contaminants. Ever watch a surgeon prepare for surgery? Lots of running water, very little touching of anything except sterile towels and gloves. ",

            "answer_text": "Can a bar of soap get dirty, or is it self-cleaning because it's soap? It depends if you're asking about real soap made with fats and sodium hydroxide or fake soap made with anything other than fats and sodium hydroxide. Real soap does not typically harbor bacteria or other crud provided it's rinsed off well. Now, if you goober it all up and don't rinse it, sure the crud is going to stay on it. On the other hand, fake soap, are especially those containing things like moisturizer and fragrance, will tends to harbor more crud even when rinsed because the crud sticks to the residuals that stick to your skin and the fake soap itself. If you're really concerned about getting clean, use real soap or a non-residual detergent like Ajax dish detergent. When I don't have time to make my own soap, I use Zote brand. - MarkKw ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, a bar of soap does indeed get dirty. That's how it gets your hands clean: by latching onto grease, dirt and oil more strongly than your skin does. Of course, when you're using soap, you're washing all those loose, dirt-trapping, dirty soap molecules away, but a bar of soap can also be contaminated with microorganisms.Dirty soap can't clean itself, though. A contaminated bar of soap gets cleaned by the same mechanical action that helps clean you up when you wash your hands: Scrubbing. ",

The grains stick to the bar But if you wash it eventually the sand grains can be removed as the outer layer is dissolved away. If you dipped it in a bacteria rich solution, some bacteria would die immediately. The rest like soil and sand would be eventually be carried away if you wash with the soap and abrade/dissolve off the outer layers ",
