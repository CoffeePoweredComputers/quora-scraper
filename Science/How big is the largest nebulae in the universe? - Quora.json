            "answer_text": "It depends in part on how you define a nebula. A nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. As such, Lyman-alpha blobs would qualify, but they are seen as distinct from nebulae. The biggest nebula discovered so far is the H I region that encapsulates the galaxy NGC 262 in a halo of gas. It\u2019s a spiral nebula that measures 2.600.000 light-years in size. Here are the biggest nebulae discovered so far: NGC 262 Halo Cloud \u2014 2.600.000 light-yearsMagellanic Stream \u2014 600.000 light-yearsHanny\u2019s Voorwerp \u2014 100.000 light-yearsGreat Rift \u2014 30.000 light-yearsEagle Nebula \u2014 7700 light-yearsWesterhout 31 \u2014 3000 light-yearsLagoon Nebula \u2014 2200 light-yearsNGC 604 \u20141520 light-yearsGum Nebula \u2014 1100 light-yearsN44 \u2014 1000 light-yearsOne of the most famous nebulae is probably the Eagle Nebula.

As you know, stars can be in many different sizes and the nebulae is made up of this stars so\u2026 it is depend on the size of the star that how big a nebulae can. If the star is huge then nebulae will be very big and colorful also and if the star is small like our Sun then the nebulae will be small in size. But if the star in binary condition so maybe it\u2019ll big if both star will explode. Sometime, it can be different because some stars don\u2019t form in nebulae, or some don\u2019t have material to spread the material in space. It is actually not depend upon stars' size but upon the variety of stars.  ",
