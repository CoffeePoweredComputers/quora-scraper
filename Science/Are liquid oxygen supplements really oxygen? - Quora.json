            "answer_text": "Yes. Any atom that exists is reactive and must bond with another atom. The oxygen we breathe is actually O2 meaning that 2 oxygen atoms are bonded to each other. These atoms naturally repel one another, so the only way it can be in liquid form is for alot of oxygen molecules get forced into a container to the point of a liquid being produced. This creates very high pressure. The tanks that have liquid oxygen in them have pressure regulators to control the flow of oxygen gas coming out. But the contents of oxygen tanks really is pure oxygen. ",

Honestly, I have not even heard of such a nonsensical claim by anyone selling dietary supplements, but without further consideration, reject them out of hand. ",
