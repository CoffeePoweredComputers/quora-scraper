            "answer_text": "Here is an example. Every single nucleus of every single atom (except hydrogen-1 with its single proton). When a nucleus forms, inside a star, supernova or reactor, a small amount of mass is released as \u2018binding energy\u2019 in the processes of overcoming the repulsive forces of protons. The mass of any nucleus (except H) is always less than the sum of the masses of the free protons and neutrons from which it is constructed. Nuclear Binding Energy Actually, given the number of atoms in the universe, I\u2019d say that was a zillion examples. There are no end of nuclear processes where a particle is created from energy. Here\u2019s a common example - Beta minus decay - an unstable neutron (specifically a down quark within in it) decays to give a proton (i.e. the down changes to an up) and the energy released forms an electron and a neutrino.

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are many. The difficulty in seeing the phenomenon for yourself is that the conversion factor, [math]c^2[/math], is so large when expressed in familiar units, that it is either very hard to measure the tiny mass, or very hard to contain the enormous energy. For chemical reactions, not more than 15 parts per billion of the mass is converted to energy. In particle physics, conversions in both directions are measured all the time\u2014hundreds or thousands of times per second, when the accelerator is running. Take one example: the top quark, with a mass of about 200 protons, was created by colliding two proton-masses of particle together (one proton and one anti-proton). Each initial particle had a kinetic energy equivalent to 1,000 proton masses, and a lot of that became the mass of the top quark. ",
