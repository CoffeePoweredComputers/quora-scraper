            "answer_text": "It is a massive stellar remnant. So many people think they know what a black hole is and are dead wrong. Let me start by saying that nobody, and I mean NOBODY actually knows what black holes are with 100% accuracy because by their very definition we can never get any information about anything beyond the event horizon. That being said we have a couple logically solid models(albeit with a few MAJOR kinks to work out). Let me start with how black holes form, to do which I need to explain stellar formation. Stars are gravitationally coalesced masses of elements and dust that incrementally grow their size by the exponentially increasing pull. As more and more mass is added to it\u2019s mass, more matter is accelerated faster and with a greater force to the center of mass. Once a certain threshold for energy density and temperature is reached, the force of gravity from the stars mass is such that it can overcome the strong nuclear force which keeps atomic nuclei bound and fusion occurs. Fusion releases tremendous amounts of energy outward spherically from the center of mass(fusion core) resulting in a force symmetry between gravitational potential pushing inwards to the core and radiation pressure emenating outwards spherically from the core. The result is a stable stellar structure, that is until fusion runs out of fuel. Now depending on the mass and elemental contents of the star their are a few different end times for a star, if the star is under 20 solar masses fusion stops after carbon and the star forms a white dwarf. Over 20 solar masses and the star will end with a supernova leaving either a neutron star or a black hole. The supernova explosion is the mass of the stars atmosphere(the mass of the star not contained in the core) which, no longer being supported outwardly be fusion radiative pressure, is accelerating towards the core incredibly fast. The core\u2019s density is increasing equally as quickly until it reaches the point of becoming either electron or neutron degeneracy matter preventing any increase in it\u2019s density. Now that the core\u2019s boundry is hard the remainder of the outer mass that is falling inwards at incredible speeds rebounds against the core\u2019s boundary releasing immense amounts of kinetic energy which is the core collapse type supernova. If there is enough remaining matter to put the mass of the stellar remnant over the Chandrasekhar limit the neutron star becomes a black hole. Now the black hole is just a steallar remnant from a supernova, it is comprised of the same matter that the neutron star was made of, mainly neutron degeneracy matter along with heavy elements and ions. The \u201chole\u201d that people think black holes are is usually meant to mean the singularity of the black hole which is where our understanding of physics breaks down. The vast majority of physicists do not think that singularities exist in the physical sense in our universe. Think about it, our universe had a beginning, and as such is finite in mass and temporality. Now if we were to take singularities literally they would be points of infinite density existing for infinite periods of time relative to stationary observers. How can there exist an infinite density with a finite amount of mass, further more how can there be an infinite time period existing within a finite period of time? They merely show us that we have an incomplete understanding of physics. That being said the material of black holes outside of the singularity is matter just like everywhere else in the universe ",

            "answer_text": "Our galaxy was once a single mass of fusion created by a collision that is hard, if not impossible to describe because of the age of our universe. Galaxies are shrapnel that don't hit anything for a long time. All the stars, planets, moons, rings, everything in our galaxy, were once a part of this fusion laced mass. Centrifugal force flattened this mass. At some point, the disk separated from the mass and our \u201cblack hole\u201d was born. It did not \u201caccrete\u201d gas and dust. It didn't \u201ckeep growing\u201d. It was born first and the stars were the biggest masses in the disk that started the whole process over again as it cooled. Centrifugal force flattened them to disks to create the solar systems of each star. If they weren't spinning enough, they cooled as one, giant mass which I believe is what we call a red giant. Light can't escape but radiation can. So yes, black holes are giant stars. ",
