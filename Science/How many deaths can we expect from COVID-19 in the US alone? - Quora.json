            "answer_text": "1,000,000 seems like a good, round number. As I type this on May 21st the reported death count is 96,200. By force of economic pressure States are opening up for the first time since the pandemic began. No doubt this will increase the rate of infections. Trump\u2019s leadership has been ineffectual so general testing and contact tracing can\u2019t be expected to be on point everywhere, and the infection and death rates must inevitably rise. There\u2019s nowhere near herd immunity yet so relatively few will be protected from the disease. There\u2019s been good news about previously infected people now being immune (expected but now proven) and there\u2019s been earlier than expected positive results about vaccines. Most of the deaths have occurred in the last two months for an average death rate of 50k or 600k/yr. The disease is just ramping up though. I would expect a death rate minimum of 75k/month thru to November when a vaccine might be expected by the earliest. In America more than any other country COVID-19 seems to be underestimated. Whether this is by libertarians or otherwise freedom-lovers obeying social distancing guidelines seems unlikely for significant numbers. Apocryphal I know, but in my last discussion of this type that I had on Quora about this pandemic it was claimed the disease was no worse than a light flu! Attitudes like that will end up killing an awful lot of people. Trump wants to win his re-election campaign and the only way for him to do it is by opening up the economy. The more he does of this the more people will die. If he opens beyond reason the final death count could hit 1.5\u20131.7M (my estimate). ",

            "answer_text": "Original question: How many deaths can we expect from Covid-19 in the US alone? (I will answer this interpreting \u201calone\u201d to mean \u201centirely\u201d, as in \u201centirely due to Covid-19\u201d.) The deaths in the US that are due entirely to COVID-19 could be something close to nothing if we can enhance the spread of the novel corona virus strain known as subtype S. This strain is less aggressive than other strains. The majority of people in the US who will die from coronavirus are people who are on the verge of dying from something else - like cardio-pulmonary disease, or good old fashioned \u201cold age\u201d. (Note: people who have severely compromised immune systems can be considered to be on the verge of dying from something else. \u201cSomething else\u201d to be determined.) It\u2019s a stretch, but when someone dies, CNN will report that Covid-19 and President Trump deserve most or all of the credit. Not obesity or heart disease or old age. Early on in the pandemic, a British fellow named Walsh attended a meeting in Singapore where he contracted Covid-19.[1] I presume that he caught subtype S because he had no symptoms and felt good enough to go skiing for four days in France before he returned home and learned that he had been exposed and needed to be tested. It turns out that he is what is known as a \u201csuper spreader\u201d. He is known to have infected a number of people before he self-quarantined. If super spreaders with S subtype Covid-19 infect a cadre of new super spreaders, and they in turn infect a third generation, etc etc, this pandemic will end with a whimper. We will defeat a geometric progression with a better geometric progression at virtually no cost. There\u2019s no need to kill the cruise ship business, airlines, theaters, shopping malls, etc., civilization. I\u2019m within a decade or two of what I hope will be a sensible exit strategy. I don\u2019t want the system to spend thousands of dollars a day keeping me alive just to sit propped up in front of a TV not knowing or caring what day it is. Take half of the Medicare money that would be spent at the assisted living facility and give it to my kids. This is my choice. Covid-19 is going to make this choice for a lot of people. Maybe also for me, if I don\u2019t catch subtype S before everything goes to chaos. Footnotes[1] One man linked to at least 9 coronavirus cases after traveling from Singapore to France to UK",
