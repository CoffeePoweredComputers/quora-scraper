            "answer_text": "A candle, by itself has very very low levels of VOC (volatile organic compound), almost immeasurable amounts. This is because the candle is made up of paraffin, or high molecular weight (> 250 grams per mole) hydrocarbons that are \u201clow-melting solids\u201d. A scented candle does emit volatile organic molecules that are the reason for its scent. However, the concentration of these molecules in the air around the candle at any time is extremely small. This is because the \u201cscent\u201d is selected in such a way that minuscule amounts of it in the air is able to be detected, recognized and distinguished by the human nasal receptors. So, you don\u2019t need very much of the scent molecules in the air for you to enjoy the scent. So, once again, the VOC of an unlit candle is so small that you can ignore it. When you burn a candle, the situation can, and does change. When a candle burns, the flame melts the solid paraffin just below the flame to a liquid, and the wick absorbs this molten wax and transports it up into the flame, where the temperature is hot enough for the liquid paraffin to be vaporized. Paraffin vapor inside the flame is immediately OXIDIZED by oxygen in the atmosphere. This oxidation is exothermic, and puts out energy in the form of heat and light. The \u201cburning\u201d is what causes the flame to be sustained, and for the candle to continue to burn. You will have noticed that a candle burns with a yellow flame. This is an indication of \u201cincomplete combustion\u201d. Hydrocarbon (paraffin) burns in excess oxygen by breaking down into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). However, incomplete combustion (where oxygen availability is limited) results in the breakdown of long chain paraffin (e.g. C20H42) to smaller bits (e.g. C8H18, C4H8, 4CO2, CO, 3C and 13H2O). All of these \u201cbits\u201d are volatile, and part of the hot gases. If these bits do not manage to get caught within the corona of the flame and \u201cburn\u201d, they escape the flame and will hang in the atmosphere around the flame. This is exactly the definition of VOC. In the above example, 3C refers to three moles of carbon, which is emitted by the flame as soot. If you hold a cold piece of metal directly above the candle flame, you will notice that the metal surface darkens with the deposition of soot. Therefore, a burning candle DOES emit some small amount of VOC. Typically, the amount of VOC that is emitted from the candle flame is much less than 1%. So, it is nothing to worry about, as long as you \u201ctrim the wick\u201d, and make sure that the flame is not burning with a very distinct yellow flame, and leaving a black contrail of \u201csmoke\u201d in the air.

            "answer_text": "A volatile organic compound is a carbon-containing chemical that has relatively high vapor pressure at room temperature. It evaporates easily. The main component of candles is wax, which is composed of long hydrocarbon chains that usually contain some oxygen-containing functional groups. Because of the size of wax molecules, they have a very low vapor pressure at room temperature. A candle left alone for years does not evaporate. Therefore, candle wax is not volatile under normal conditions, but whether or not candles contain volatile organic compounds depends on the candle. If the candle is scented, it certainly does, as the scent molecules are volatile organic compounds - they create an odor because they evaporate. Also, wax will evaporate if the temperature is high enough. This is precisely what happens when the candle is burning, but this is way above room temperature. ",

            "answer_text": "All fragrances are VOCs. Otherwise you couldn't smell them. Molecules must be in the gas phase to be smelled. So the scent in the candles is a VOC. All essential oils that have fragrances you can easily smell would be considered VOCs. However, the VOCs in the oil based paints that you hear nasty issues arising from are known sensitizers and some are known carcinogens. Essential oils and other scents are not used in candles if they are suspected carcinogens. They can cause allergic reactions in some people, and some are so sensitive they must avoid that aisle in the store. So, if you are reacting badly to a scented candle (and even beeswax candles have a particular odor, therefore VOCs too), don't buy that kind. Try scented candles that have a smell that you know you are not allergic or sensitive to. I am sensitized to many perfumes and scents but can buy cinnamon candles, and vanilla candles and pine scented candles at Christmas time, but no lavender, flower scents, and very few mixed scents. Another option to make sure your house smells good without risking an allergic reaction, is to put a cinnamon stick and a couple of clovesl into a pot with some water and summer it gently on the stove. Or buy an essential oil diffuser and use only oils that you know you are not sensitive to. I like peppermint oil in it, or ginger oil, or cinnamon oil. I don't buy many of the mixtures called things like \u201crestful sleep\u201d or \u201cbreathe easy\u201d or \u201cmuscle ease\u201d, because many of those have ingredients I can't tolerate. So read the labels and only buy ones that you are sure are okay. Don't do a \u201cwonder if I'll kill myself with this one\u201d experiment. ",

The compounds they burn are volatile at a high temperature; but the question doesn\u2019t specify the temperature involved. Any organic compound that burns has to be in vapor form to mix with oxygen and burn, or at least a part of it has to be. Even wood requires this. What isn\u2019t volatile is ash. If you define volatile organic compounds as being volatile at room temperature, then, no, other than whatever is mixed with the wax in scented candles. ",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is yes. If they have a scent at room temperature, then you are smelling a volatile organic component. Additional VOCs are released as the candle heats up and burns. Whether or not something is volatile is very much temperature dependent. At 1 degree Kelvin, you won\u2019t have VOCs. At 50,000 degrees Kelvin, I believe any organic compound would be volatile. There are also regulatory definitions of VOCs. The last I remember, acetone was not considered a VOC, because it is not an ozone depleting substance. ",

These waxes are not generally known for VOC release at room temperature but when you volatilize the type of wax by burning the candle a small amount organic compound vapour is given off as the burning breaks down the hydrocarbons involved. A study done in Europe found that when burned properly the amounts given off are not sufficient to cause health problems. Cheers, Wayne ",
