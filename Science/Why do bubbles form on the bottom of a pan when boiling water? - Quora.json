            "answer_text": "The vapour pressure of water is nonzero at any temperature (it is around 0.03 bar at 20 C, for example). What happens at the normal boiling point is simply that tiny bubbles are allowed to grow larger because their internal vapour pressure is equal to the externally applied pressure of 1 bar. At lower temperatures, any microscopic bubbles forming spontaneously will shrink and disappear because the external pressure is larger than the internal one. Bubble formation is more likely to occur at a microscopically rough surface, that\u2019s why you tend to see bubbles forming on the bottom and sidewall of a pan when water boils. ",

            "answer_text": "If the bottom of the pan is hotter than 100 degrees celsius (the boiling point of water), the water touching the pan will start turning into steam, which is a gas and looks like bubbles. When the bubbles become big enough to float up against the pressure/weight of the water then they rise to the surface. Sometimes you will see little bubbles forming when the temperature is not that hot. That is regular air (nitrogen and oxygen) that was dissolved in the water. When the temperature goes up, is forces the air out of the water and you see it as bubbles. ",
