            "answer_text": "For a good resource on the color of any mineral or solid, see Kurt Nassau\u2019s book \u201cPhysics and Chemistry of Color, Second Edition\u201d (1983). Pure carbon in the form of diamond is NOT black, but totally colorless. Impurities can change the absorption spectrum of diamond to turn in into things like the Hope Diamond\u2019s incredible blue color. They can also make it appear yellow, or other shades. So here you get a clue as to what is going on to cause color in materials. The graphite form of carbon, as single crystals, is shiny, jet black. Soot or carbon \u201cblack\u201d is generally a flat black. Then, to the question of why is carbon black: a material appears black to an individual because it is absorbing all of the spectral colors incident upon them. This must mean that carbon particles can absorb most of this radiation, and thus appear black. There are numerous mechanisms for materials to absorb incident radiation, and you will find these enumerated in Nassau\u2019s book. ",

            "answer_text": "From WikiAnswers: Carbon and graphite is highly extended fused benzene rings terminated with quinone groups and phenol groups. This allows the pi electrons to delocalize over large areas. This delocalization collapses the molecular orbitals to a point that they absorb all light in the visible region. Hence it appears black.
