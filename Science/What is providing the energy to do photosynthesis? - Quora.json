            "answer_text": "photosynthesis is: 6 CO2 + 6 H2O \u2013> C6H12O6 + 6 O2 The energy comes from the sun, a photon (hv) will put the required electron-volts through chlorophyllic capture and transportation in the chloroplast, this energy will do the homolitic/heterolitic photolysis of water: 2 H2O + hv \u2013> 4 H\u2022 + 2O\u2022 \u2013> O2 + 4H(+) + 4e- This is the energy route, the O2 is that of the above photosynthesis reaction. The 4 H+ and the 4 e- are those used in the half reaction (implicit in the above Photosinthesys reaction): 6 CO2 + 12 H(+) + 12 e- \u2013> C6H12O6 + 6 H2O and this is why the process requires the photolysis of 6 H2O.

            "answer_text": "There are already several good science-based answers to this question. I heard a slightly different question so here is a slightly different answer: Seeds are a common way for a parent plant to propagate a child plant. The seeds serve as a place for the parent plant to store the genetic information and the energy required for the seed to germinate and produce a new plant. That energy originated from the parent\u2019s photosynthesis that uses the seed as an elaborate botanical battery for its offspring. The seed has enough stored energy to sprout leaves and roots that provide nutrients and energy for future growth. Notice that you can sprout many kinds of seeds in darkness using stored energy, but the seedling will wither and die without access to light. ",

            "answer_text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which sunlight is converted to energy. For this to occur in a biological sysyem, Chlorophyll must be present. Chorophyll gives plants and cyanobacteria their colour, but also acts to convert photoelectric energy into usable forms by the plant or bacterium. Generally this is Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP). ATP is used in a biochemical process (see Calvin cycle for plants) to produce carbohydrates (simple sugars). I think bacteria use a different methodology to create these sugars but all photosynthesis requires Chlorophyll to be present. ",

            "answer_text": "Light energy excites electrons in photopigments to higher energy levels, such that they readily enter electron transport chains through which protons are vicariously pumped into the thylakoid lumen forming the membrane potential that drives the chemiosmotic phosphorylation process making ATP to be used to drive the Calvjn cycle in making sugar for cellular structure and energy. Other such excited electrons in photophiments enter electron transport chains that result in the formation of the reducing agent NADPH used in the Calvin cycle to encourage carbon atoms from CO2 to form bonds with each other forming the sugar produced by the Calvin cycle.

These photons facilitate reactions that cause the light energy to be converted into a chemical energy in the form of charged molecules that, through a cascade of reactions allow the plant to produces sugars that in can use to \u201cfeed\u201d its cells.
