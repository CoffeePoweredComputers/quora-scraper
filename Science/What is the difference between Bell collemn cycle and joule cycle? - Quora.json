            "answer_text": "Well this question may arised by just having glance over it. If you observed it carefully you may come to know that they are completely reverse acting and Joule's cycle is applicable to Heat engine and gives heat out to surrounding.sBell Coleman cycle is applicable to Refrigerator where heat is taken from surrounding to make it (surrounding)cool. So from figure: For Joule\u2019s Cycle: 1 is compression of fuel in engine 2 is combustion of fuel in engine 3 is expansion of burnt fuel in gas form 4 is exhaust is sent out And For Bell Coleman Cycle: 1 is compression of refrigerant in compressor 2 is conversion of liquid form of refrigerant in gaseous form 3 is expansion of refrigerant to create pressure drop viz ultimately to drop temperature 4 is to take Heat from surrounding That is how they are differ even though they look same as because of constant pressure lines. Don't confuse they are completely reverse in operation. #Thanks ",
