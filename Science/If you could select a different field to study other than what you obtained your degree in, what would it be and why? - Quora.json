            "answer_text": "A2A Academically, I have an AS in Electromechanical Technology, a BS in Computer Engineering Technology, and an MS in IT Management, so most of my background is related to IT. However, if I changed fields, I\u2019d probably either look at some sort of engineering, most likely electrical. However, I also have an interest in economics, because of how much it actually applies to real life but you don\u2019t realize it; this came about after reading Freakonomics. Statistics is also up there, for similar reasons. I tried teaching, both high school and college level, but decided that I didn\u2019t want to go into academia. School politics is horrible; I caught two students plagiarizing papers in a university class but was told by administration that, since it was just homework and wasn\u2019t a test, it wasn\u2019t something to worry about. Plus, most of the students I taught, at any grade level, really seemed entitled and would argue their grades after every assignment. ",
