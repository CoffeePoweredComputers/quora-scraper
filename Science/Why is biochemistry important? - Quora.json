            "answer_text": "Importance of biochemistry in MEDICINE \u2022 Physiology: Biochemistry helps one understand the biochemical changes and related physiological alteration in the body.\u2022 Pathology: Based on the symptoms described by the patient, physician can get clue on the biochemical change and the associated disorder. For example if a patient complains about stiffness in small joints, then physician may predict it to be gout and get confirmed by evaluating uric acid levels in the blood. As uric acid accumulation in blood results in gout.\u2022 Nursing and diagnosis: In nursing importance of clinical biochemistry is invaluable. Also almost all the diseases or disorders have some biochemical involvement. So the diagnosis of any clinical condition is easily possible by biochemical estimations. Importance of biochemistry in AGRICULTURE \u2022 Prevent diseases and Enhance Yield/ growth: It helps for prevention, treatment of diseases and also increase the production or yield. Some hormones promote growth, while other promote flowering, fruit formation etc. In fisheries, use of substances to promote fish growth, their reproduction etc can be understood.\u2022 Adulteration: Even the composition of food material produced, their alteration or adulteration for example in honey can be found by biochemical tests. Biochemistry tests help prevent contamination.\u2022 Biochemical tests for the pesticide residues or other toxic waste in plant, food grain and soil can be evaluated. Hence during import and export of food grains a biochemical check of the toxic residues is done to fix the quality.\u2022 In animal husbandry, the quality of milk can be checked by biochemical tests. It also helps diagnose any disease condition in animals and birds.\u2022 In fisheries the water quality is regularly monitored by biochemical tests. Any drastic change in water chemistry & composition of fishery ponds can lead to vast death of fishes and prawns, hence the tests are done on regular basis to see salt content (calcium content), pH, accumulation of waste due to not changing water for long etc.\u2022 In Plant/ Botany: Biochemistry of plants gave way to breakthrough of how food is synthesized in them and the reason why they are autotrophs i.e. not dependent on other living beings for food. Biochemistry in plants describes; Photosynthesis; Respiration; Different sugars; Plants secondary metabolites. Importance of biochemistry in NUTRITION \u2022 Food chemistry gives an idea of what we eat. The nutrients value of food material can also be determined by biochemical tests.\u2022 Role of nutrients: Due to biochemistry the importance of vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, their contribution to health were known. Hence there is frequent recommendation for inclusion of essential amino-acids, cod liver oil, salmon fish oil etc. by physicians and other health and fitness experts.\u2022 Physician can prescribe to limit usage of certain food like excess sugar for diabetics, excess oil for heart & lung problem prone patients etc. As these carbohydrate and fat biochemical can inhibit the recovery rate from said disorder. This knowledge is due to their idea on food chemistry and related Importance of biochemistry in PHARMACY \u2022 Drug Constitution: Biochemistry gives an idea of the constitution of the drug, its chances of degradation with varying temperature etc. How modification in the medicinal chemistry helps improve efficiency, minimize side effects etc.\u2022 The half life and Drug storage: This is a test done on biochemical drugs to know how long a drug is stable when kept at so and so temperature. For example many enzymes, hormones are stored for dispensing. These get deteriorated over time due to temperature or oxidation, contamination and also due to improper storage.\u2022 Drug metabolism: It also gives an idea of how drug molecules are metabolized by many biochemical reactions in presence of enzymes. This helps to avoid drugs which have poor metabolism or those with excessive side effects from being prescribed or dispensed to the patient. ",

            "answer_text": "Analogy: to build 10 storey building, u must have bricks, cement, alignment, arrangement, blue print , etc etc\u2026 and these all things will play an important role in determining how your building is going to look or how stable it will be. Similarly, in order to understand human, in order to make sure human being (or any living thing) stays healthy.. We have to follow certain schedule.. Certain regulations\u2026 what all this regulations would be?? One can understand only when they know how human beings (or the constituents inside them) are functioning\u2026 How they all are interacting.. And what exactly are the things taking part in all this interaction.. And how they are helping human body (or living body) to grow!! And many many such issues..!! So, unless we know these: the basic unit of a living body (which is a biological cell)its constituents (chemicals, enzymes, etc).. Which is actually called biomoleculesFormation and degradation of these biomoleculesInteractions between themother related basics,We will definitely not be able to understand the higher level things in living body. Eg. Which shampoo a scientist should make to get rid of dandruff? (Biochemistry will help u here in finding how dandruff are getting formed? Which interaction or enzyme to block in order not to let this dandruff form) So in conclusion: it is very very important no matter which field you are in as long as you are in some \u201cbio\u201d related field. Suggestion: if you really wanna be a scientist in this field (\u201cbio\u201d field), make sure your biochemistry basics are very clear. ",
