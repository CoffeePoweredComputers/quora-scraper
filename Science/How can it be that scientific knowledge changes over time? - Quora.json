            "answer_text": "Why does scientific knowledge change over time? Because falsification is the engine that drives scientific progress. You start with some facts and phenomena. You examine them closely and describe how you think they might be linked. A hypothesis, call it. You work it out and develop it into a theory that explains the results you see. Sweet! But is it true? You\u2019re a scientist. You plan to publish it. It had better be true! If your peers poke holes all through it, you\u2019ll look like a DORK. So you ask yourself about your theory: well, if this is true, what else must be true? You make predictions: if your theory is correct, then in addition to the results we already see (which tend to support the theory - well, they ought to! The theory was developed with them in mind, to explain their occurrence) we can predict we will also see X, Y, Z. If the theory is true. Observation. Explanation i.e. Theory. Extrapolation i.e. Prediction. What\u2019s next? You gather more observations. In particular, you conduct experiments to determine whether X, Y, Z occur. What you are actually trying to do here is falsify your theory. Oh, yeah - you have to. All the other scientists will. You try as hard as you can to poke holes in your own theory, because you know if you don\u2019t, you will come off so bad. Every scientist out there loves the scientific method as much as you do, and the main way it goes is poke them holes. You design every experiment you can think of to prove your theory false. You conduct every experiment as rigorously as you can. And you determine: X and Z occur. Y does not. You have falsified your theory. If your theory were true, Y would occur. So you go back to the theory stage and gut and stitch and insert and twist. You try to account for the non-appearance of the predicted Y. And you see what you got wrong. Re-draft the theory and you now have a clean and rigorous explanation that accounts for all known facts of the phenomenon, including the fact X and Z occur and Y does not (even though you might think it would at first, nope, we now understand why it does not). Ready to publish? HARDLY. You take the theory and make more predictions from it. If the theory is true, what else will occur? And you test them, and you falsify and you refine and you predict and you test and you falsify and refine. FINALLY, you\u2019ve got a really comprehensive theory! It provides a new explanation for previously-observed phenomena, it accounts for a positive hodge-podge of facts, and you\u2019re confident there\u2019s no holes in it you\u2019ve overlooked. This theory advances science. It improves upon our best descriptions of some piece of reality. And you publish. And you hold your breath.  Science is always moving forward in this way. Scientists are eying the entire sum of our body of knowledge, in each of its parts. They\u2019re looking for new predictions they can make. Things that will be true - if the current theory is true. They\u2019re making tons of predictions we can\u2019t even test yet, don\u2019t know how! And they\u2019re working, day by day by week by month by year, to bring previous predictions made into testable range. Because that\u2019s where the tire hits the road. And whenever some part of an established theory can be falsified, scientists rush in with new and better explanations to try and test and fix our understanding. Scientific knowledge changes over time, because a theory is not reality. It is a description of reality. And as time goes by and our tools and measurements and techniques improve, we find ways of tightening our descriptions down, ever more closely upon reality. Closer and closer and closer and closer. Bear in mind the theory \u201coverturned\u201d was usually right. It was simply not as precise as it could infinitely be. What is? Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation got us to the moon. Newton\u2019s theory was overturned by Einstein in 1915. It actually made headlines all around the world. A theory in physics! Major world news. Slow week, I guess. In 1969 when we landed on the moon, NASA was well aware that Einstein\u2019s theory had overturned Newton\u2019s. They used Newton\u2019s because Newton\u2019s was right. Einstein\u2019s was righter - but by margins so infinitesimal they only mattered to physicists, not rocket scientists. Not engineers. The calculations were precise, correct to within an nth, and most importantly, easier to do - meaning smaller chance of error. There could be no errors. Scientific knowledge changes because our descriptions get better and better. They get better and better because scientists spend every working hour trying to tease out predictions they can use to falsify existing theory. But very often, all they do is replace a theory that is proven, that works and gets results, with a theory that\u2019s just that touch finer, just that shade deeper. A more closely drawn portrait of reality. You\u2019d expect our descriptions of reality to change, wouldn\u2019t you? The better we get at the craft of perception, depiction, correction? As a sketch of a cathedral improves with the artist\u2019s maturity. I mean, you certainly wouldn\u2019t expect reality to change. ",

            "answer_text": "First, let\u2019s start with one dictionary definition of knowledge: facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.With that definition, we might leap to the conclusion that the operative term in the definition for scientific knowledge is the word theoretical. But I think that might be a mistake. Scientific knowledge must always be testable, and in general, knowledge obtained via the scientific method is not considered to be scientific knowledge until it has survived various practical tests. Scientific knowledge must therefore be both theoretical and practical. Scientific knowledge is the set of well-tested explanations that are useful in that they have predictive power in their domain. So how does scientific knowledge change over time? The physicist David Deutsch says it quite succinctly: The growth of knowledge consists of correcting misconceptions in our theories. Deutsch, David. The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World (Kindle Locations 755-756). Penguin Publishing Group. Kindle Edition. This may seem like a strange admission: our scientific knowledge contains misconceptions. Some people might think that reveals a weakness in science. But in reality, the honest acceptance that our best scientific theories may contain misconceptions is the bedrock foundation of what makes science so successful. Knowledge cannot grow in a culture that is convinced that all ancient knowledge must be correct and unquestioned. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy does scientific knowledge change over time?\u201d Our instruments improve, allowing us to measure phenomena more precisely, and correct inaccuracies in our previous data. Also, over time, the world changes, we learn new things, and we have a new context in which to evaluate our previous assumptions. Scientific findings are always subject to revision: this is a feature, not a bug. However, we should neither accept all findings as gospel, nor should we reject all findings. This is where reason comes in: we study the findings, and to the best of our current abilities, see if they are reasonably reliable. We test and re-test, and sometimes come to the conclusion (paraphrased) that \u201cfor now, given what we know now, these findings seem reasonable.\u201d If you read a lot of scientific journal articles, not the mainstream press, you\u2019ll see that their conclusions are generally written carefully with a number of caveats and conditions. It\u2019s the mainstream press that jumps the gun and treats tentative findings as gospel, and deceptive internet sites that treat findings as \u201cfake.\u201d Naturally, the world is more complex, and most people should not evaluate scientific findings unless they have some university-level science under their belt. Or there really should be a component of critical thinking in all levels of school, just to teach students what to look for when digesting the massive amounts of media thrown at them every day. ",

            "answer_text": "Scientific knowledge can change over time as the humans do change; if, for instance, we were more brough up developing our inner forces and our intellectual possible acquisition of facts together, we would end up knowing differently. For example, we could comprehend everything from both our intuition and our reason. This would enable us to get access to more than the reality that we normaly perceive from our five senses. In essence, we could understand deeply what we are here for, we could deeply know our=selves enough to behave properly in order to maintain a high standard of Life. Let us hope we reach to this level of knowledge, both scientific, and scientific intuitive knowledge that can help us to behave properly. roland ",
