            "answer_text": "Yes there are many examples. I will give you a modern day example of such an animal. This example is the Hawaiian nene, or the Hawaiian goose. It is a species of goose that evolved from the Branta canadensis, or the Canadian goose. It is believed it first arrived in the Hawaiian island areas less than 500 thousand years ago. And has quickly evolved to what it is today. While it is the state bird it is an endangered species. So much so that as last I heard there was only some few hundred breeding pairs left. The species mates for life. So what evolved about them?? Well, it is one of the very few species of these type of bird fowl that can not fly,nor can it swim and it is awkward on land as running. This bird species has genetically lost all these abilities . If it gets in to deep of water it will drown. Chickens have a better ability of flight. And well it has no need to run on land..just slowly waddle about to gather food. This change of evolution took place because once it arrived in these island areas it had no natural predators. Thus it had no use for those other features. The weather was warm enough to have no need to travel or migrate seasonally. The bird became an over population at one point point even and became a source of food for humans. While that did not threaten its numbers drastically at first..after time it did have effect.. remember the bird can not evade predators. It can not fly or swim away, and it can not run away either.. it has always been a sitting..goose ..lol But humans also started hunting it for its brilliant colored feathers that where indeed a beautiful gold color. And that hunt for just some feathers has put it near extinction. Now there are other predators introduced to the islands besides just man. And even though we are protecting as many as we can by putting them in private bird protection reserves and exotic bird breeders, the numbers are still dwindling. Despite our efforts the Hawaiian goose will probably go extinct. Had this breed of species still had an ability of flight or swimming and such it may of stood a chance. But its evolution while having no need for such needs of abilities and got rid of those traits, those missing traits have become their downfall in the end. So there you have it. A species of bird in modern day on the verge of extinction because its traits that it de-evolved ended up being harmful in the long run longevity of the species. I use to work at an exotic bird farm as a handler and care taker. This is where I first learned about this bird species. If I recall correctly the species also has very small clutches of eggs ..just a couple to few eggs and not very often. So even if it does have say a clutch of 3 or 4 eggs at most..they still have survival rate to hatching, and then survival to adulthood. The odds are against them. And it is these traits that caused themselves to climb downward towards extinction. Compare them to other goose breeds and soecies.. almost none have taken this path and they flourish ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIf evolution is blind, shouldn't there be organisms that evolved themselves into a dead end? Are there any examples of this?\u201d I have a sneaking suspicion that this question comes out of yet another all too common misunderstanding of the basics of evolution. Essentially, a lot of people get that evolution is the result of random mutations, and how those mutated creatures interact with the environment of their times. But then the student sort of mis-visualizes things a bit, and imagine creatures born with three heads, or feet but no knees or whatever. Actually, there were some ancients in Europe who had that idea, more or less, and imagined that creatures once showed up with all the parts that ,modern creatures have, just not in the same configuration. The important thing I\u2019m trying to get to, is that just having a mutation occur, doesn\u2019t constitute what we think of as evolution. Not even if the creature manages to survive and have children who also show the mutation. It doesn\u2019t constitute evolution, until what we could call an EVOLUTIONARY EVENT occurs, that makes it so that the creatures with the mutation are MORE successful in their environment than the ones who do not have the mutation. (The event CAN be a huge thing like an asteroid strike, but it can also be a slow acting event, such as climate change, or the arrival of another species from elsewhere which changes survivability factors). Here\u2019s the important point, about what I suspect this question has wrong. If a mutation occurs, that BY ITSELF results in a creature failing to survive to create offspring, without any evolutionary event influencing things, that\u2019s not an example of \u201can evolutionary dead end,\u201d that\u2019s just a lethal mutation. An \u201cEvolutionary dead end,\u201d is where a species changes through mutation, and survives for a long time, and then experiences and evolutionary event that wipes the species out entirely. Even that should probably be changed, in some cases at least, to specify that the mutation changed the species so that at first it was more viable than it\u2019s non-mutated relatives, but then later BECAUSE of the mutation, it loses it\u2019s survivability. The giant dinosaurs might be a good example of that: their large size made them extra powerful for a long long time, but then after the asteroid hit, anything that huge died out, for lack of food. One last consideration. It is quite possible, and I think it has happened, that a species can create it\u2019s OWN evolutionary dead end, without an external evolutionary event occurring. This also doesn\u2019t quite fit the way the question is asked, but it bears attention. A creature can become so evolutionarily successful, that it outlasts some of it\u2019s essential resources. A creature could succeed so well, that it spreads throughout the entire planet, because it can use some specific resource on the planet, to overcome any obstacle to its growth. Right up to the day it consumes the last bit of that resource. And thereafter dies out completely, triumphant in every way. ",
