            "answer_text": "You are right, the Sun cannot burn in space with no oxygen. Well, not entirely right, it could also burn in the presence of flourine, or chlorine, or bromine, or well, quite a list of other \u201coxidizing agents\u201d (which, oddly, do not for the most part contain oxygen) But \u201cburning\u201d is \u201ccombining with an oxidizing agent\u201d and given the absence of that in any bulk\u2026 ok, another caveat, there\u2019s actually quite a lot of oxygen in the Sun. Turns out that\u2019s one of the most common elements in space, and the Sun, being a big gravity well, has quite a lot of it gathered together. And its\u2026 well more on the \u201cand it\u2019s\u2026\u201d part later. Anyway, it\u2019s just that there\u2019s a lot more hydrogen and helium there than oxygen, vastly more, and we can ignore the oxygen for the moment. Because The Sun isn\u2019t burning. I know, you\u2019re used to seeing a light source and thinking \u201cwell, that\u2019s fire\u201d But you aren\u2019t really, are you? Because you see light bulbs all the time, and they, at least older ones, glow brightly because they have a little spring inside which has been heated to high temperatures in a vacuum.. deliberately in a vacuum because that means, as you\u2019ve already pointed out, they won\u2019t burn. Things emit light because they are hot, not because they are on fire. Fire is just a way to make things get hot. But electricity will work too. If you have an electric stove, or a toaster, you can watch this work as well, notice that the elements start to glow when they get hot. Again, they aren\u2019t on fire, they\u2019re just really hot, so they are radiating visible light. Now, what\u2019s another thing that gets really hot and emits light?  Ah, the atom bomb. Well, the Sun isn\u2019t on fire, and it isn\u2019t a metal element being heated by electric current. It isn\u2019t even a Fission bomb like the ones used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and, we hope, never again. They use Uranium or Plutonium or potentially a number of other very heavy and very rare elements, which split into smaller elements releasing energy. No, it\u2019s a fusion bomb. That uses two atoms, usually in our case Hydrogen, and fuses them together, forming the heavier Helium and releasing energy. Remember how I mentioned there\u2019s lots of Hydrogen in there? Well, that\u2019s handy, because if you press hydrogen together really really really hard, it fuses and boom, ignition, and since there\u2019s lots and lots, the reaction keeps on running for a few billion years. We\u2019re about halfway through the Hydrogen Fusion Explosion that is called the Sun. That\u2019s the \u201cand it\u2019s\u2026\u201d I mentioned earlier. Burning doesn\u2019t make or destroy oxygen. That\u2019s just breaking up molecules like O2 and combining the free oxygen atoms with Carbon or Hydrogen or Nitrogen or Iron etc, to make things like ashes, water, nitric oxides, rust. The oxygen still exists, it\u2019s just bound up with those other elements. Fusion turns two bits of hydrogen into one bit of helium. The hydrogen is gone forever, and there was, prior to this, no helium. Nothing just moved around like with mere burning, the elements were fused. And that makes a lot of heat. And heat\u2026 glows. \u201cAnd it\u2019s?\u201d Oh, well part of the chain of combinations that result from fusing heavier and heavier atoms together is the formation of Oxygen. \u201cAnd it\u2019s\u201d making some.

            "answer_text": "That's a pretty good question, and there is an incredibly complex answer which I'm sure a physicist could talk for hours about. What you're seeing is not something burning which would normally require oxygen, but rather gases so hot(10,000 degrees Fahrenheit) they are glowing. The sun is basically a massive nuclear reactor 1 million times the size of the Earth. Nuclear Fission is constantly occurring within the Sun. A byproduct of that is nuclear Fusion which involves hydrogen gas fusing to create helium gas. A byproduct of this Fusion is a lot of gas particles bouncing around throughout the sun creating massive amounts of heat. This Fusion creates so much heat, the hydrogen and helium gases near the surface of the Sun start to glow at the 10,000 degrees they're at. This glowing of gases is what you see as light particles, or Photons. These photons traveling at the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second, take about eight and a half minutes to travel to the Earth where you can see them as light , but not light from something burning, something glowing. This is a highly simplified version of what is occurring, and no doubt I've gotten one or two things wrong and probably missed a few things as well. But, the basic concept is that you are not seeing fire. You're seeing very high temperature glowing gases, predominantly hydrogen and helium. Trivia Point: even though the surface of the Sun is quite hot at 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, that's no comparison to the center of the sun which is 20 million degrees Fahrenheit..! Update 4/4/20 - 8 PM : someone advised me that there is no nuclear Fission in Stars. What I found is that here is no Nuclear Fission in the creation of stars and that nuclear Fusion is what powers our Sun. However, I also found that nuclear Fission does occur in our Sun due to the Uranium within it. Fission in our Sun seems to be contested by some and verified by others. I'm not a Physicist and I did the best that I could. It seems that some agree and others don't. I found both positions stated by physicists on the internet. ",
