            "answer_text": "Islam is (surprise!!)  i know when you read my name i lost 80% audience and credibility  ,what if my name was different? a christian or hindu name? then you would probably say ,He is a critical thinker, a student of ancient religions theology and its dogma.a brilliant fellow. But when you ask any other questions like how difficult is a heart surgery ?  or how easy is to drive an F1 racing car   ? you need an answer from a doctor or a race driver , if i said i never drove one but i think its easy as a regular car , then you call me an arrogant idiot, but not for religion, in the matters of religion the far away from it the more authority you have to speak about it (at least in the virtual world)   having said all that my dear friends , in today's political scenario one must have real courage to say Islam is the most logical religion and on my left boko haram guys waving guns at school girls and on my right some men in Pakistan stoning a women to death because she loved someone, and i am in the middle shouting at you it is the most logical religion.( not looking very good right)  I will tell you why. (you take any religion and take its name and decode it you will get the name of the founder of the religion or the place it originated from saying out loud to you its man made except Islam)  Monotheism in its complete sense , if you believe in GOD  ,(even if you ask an atheist ,if in case there is GOD how many GOD is there,)  you have to admit that logically it can be only one GOD, then most of the other religions including Christianity which believes in trinity is out of the fold of monotheism. Prophet-hood : GOD never walked the earth, he doesn't have to fit inside what he is created to understand and solve the problems, if that was the case programmers would have been working inside the PC than at silicon valley. If you accept prophet hood there is a chance that all the great human beings who apparently started religions Buddha Rama, Kirishna , Abraham Moses Jesus Mohammad all could have been prophets and preached the same monotheism and asked people to stop worshiping created things and worship GOD the creator.Later as time passed human interfered and for personnel and political gains played with religion , then GOD send another prophet to clean up everything, and so on and so forth until the final messenger.  Qura'an : it is the only book which doesn't have an author but still in publishing ,from 1400 years not a single word have been changed ,added or subtracted it is available  in the same form ,when Prophet Muhammad had it with him. It is a living and thriving religion : even in these most difficult times Islam is gaining momentum , as a Muslim we are bombarded with bad press from left right and center ( i am not questioning the press ) still every often we hear new people are coming to Islam. It is one of the fastest growing religion in Europe and US. the message is simple, and there are billions of people who follows it and leads a peaceful life , i can go on and on about the scientific compatibility, the cultural dominance,the political reach and supremacy it once enjoyed, the literary eloquence of the language Quraan and its precision and on and on  But its the message of Islam that brought billions in to the religion , that is : You worship no one but your creator, dont call him ALLAH or any other name, but address him as your creator and sustainer there are no intermediaries no priest no saint no sadhu no mulla just you and GOD, you pray to him with best of the names and do good deeds that's it . May GOD bless you all, and may he bring happiness and peace in your lives. PS: don't shower me with questions related to al-qaida , boko haram , aqap , abu sayyaf etc , i am not their spoke person , peace ",

            "answer_text": "I would to answer the question of which is the most logical religion primarily between the three main monotheistic religions.  I would like to differentiate between the contentious theological question of a god which is the basis for the monotheistic religion such as Christianity Islam and Judaism and this issue of which of those is most logical. Now leaving the first issue for another time but we will go with understanding that there is a god. The next step is to work back to the first time we know about god's revelation and choosing of a nation.  The answer to that is shown in the bible to be the Jewish religion. Now the problem arises of new religions which claim that god chose another new nation, which the Jews vehemently deny and the Christians and Muslims claim to be theirs. Now let's say that even if the matter isn't provable and there are doubts in all of them it would be logical and \"natural\" to the go back to the first provable religion which all three agree is Judaism since it was defiantly once the true religion. So far this is to prove that Judaism is the safest of all three options. I would like to add a simple proof to why it is the more logical than the others. There is a fundamental difference between Judaism and the others religions and it lies in the way that god revealed himself to the group that he wanted to chose as his nation. In both Christianity and Islam the way the god revealed him self with his want of choosing that religion was to a single chosen person(or at most a small group) with a prophecy that he is the chosen on to form the new religion. The problem is that the religion lies with us trusting completely this single individual which is not very firm ground for a religion to stand on. Where as in Judaism the revelation was to 3 million people as quoted in the bible (600,000 men between 20 and 60) so the chance of it being a fraud and made up is extremely unlikely if not impossible. \u0012\ufffd\u0012   ",

            "answer_text": "As a Christian, I could argue that the majority religion of the western world for the past 1500 years has been very effective at promoting education and science. However, to be true to the question, one must stick to the phrase \"logical perspective\". This would preclude a straight-forward answer to the question.  Logic is, rigorously, the practice of connecting premises to conclusions via rational thought. And the problem here is that a \"religion\", properly defined, amounts to a series of premises. Christianity, for example, involves a \"creation statement\" (\"How did the world come into being?\"), a \"tale of the fall\" (\"How did we get to be the way we are?\"), a \"history\" (of mankind, and our various attempts over the centuries to fix ourselves), and a \"redemption story\"... (\"How God has addressed our situation.\")  The problem with invoking Logic to resolve the religious question is that, in order to do so, one must already have decided how the world they live in \"really is\". This amounts to making the judgement to be passed into one of the premises to be assumed up front. Atheists, for example, are generally Materialists and Reductionists. Science is the proper method to understand the world, and there are no \"spirits\" or purposeful and intentional powers or processes at work around us. Some atheists (e.g. Richard Dawkins) are more overtly of this camp than others, but that tends to be the way for atheistic and humanistic philosophy. Well, there is the impasse as it were. If a Christian starts with a belief in the reality of his mind, of free will, of moral perception, etc... and concludes from these that there is a \"spiritual universe\" as well as a physical one, then the belief that \"moral impulses\" reflect a real truth, and that ultimate reality must therefore be a \"Person\" (like God), then much of the doctrines of the Christian faith will flow from this, or fall naturally into it.  But if one starts with the idea that material and non-personal objects and forces are the \"Real Universe\", and that deterministic processes are the final arbiter of all events, including our behavior, then of course (from that perspective) religion in general (and Christianity and similar religions in particular) will make no sense at all.  Therefore, the question being posed is (rigorously) unanswerable. We all often want to \"see how things really are\", and then \"choose how we react to the Universe, in keeping with the data\". Alas, God in His wisdom has not seen fit to allow us that (simplistic) choice. He responds by saying \"You choose... and then by your choice be made known!\" That is the actual answer... Pick a world-view, then act upon it. It's not a \"scientific\", mathematical or logical choice. I am an engineer, so it is very difficult to say this, but I'm afraid it is more like \"Artistic Expression\". You have to \"reach within yourself\" and decide what you really believe to be \"The Truth\" about other people and the world around you. That is, ultimately, what you will find yourself doing, one way or the other. ",

            "answer_text": "Islam is the most logical, and the match the science. Please read my explaination below.Dear brother/sister.. Read quran.. muslim's holy book that never change since 1400 years ago (not even just a single word). Quran is the word of god, not muhammad. You will find it is logical and fulfill your logical desire. If you dont trust me, read quran. In islam we pray directly to god, no need anything else as a mediator (like jesus in cristianity, or statues in hindu and budhis and animisme), because god , the one who creates the universe and us, is the most able to hear and listen your pray.  God is all-knowing, god knows everything. Gos is the creator, it is impossible if god die, what will happen if god die? In islam, god has no beginning, nor the end. God is not like the creatures. We cannot see god, but surely god is exist.  Read quran, you will find that it goes along the science, and many of them have been proven : about the sky that going bigger, about the moon and the stars that have orbits, about the round1shaped earth ( not flat like the old times said) , about the embriogenes process, about the two seas that dont mix each other, about the mountain in its geological function, about the atmosphere that gives protection to earth from the wild outer space environtment, about the iron that is actually not from earth. Islam doesnt have racism at all, arab is not better than non arab, nonarab is not better than arab, the thing that makes person better is just piety. If you think that islam is associated with terrorism. This is quran what quran explains that islam strictly forbid terrorism.\" whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs. Then indeed many of them, [even] after that, throughout the land, were transgressors\" quran, surah al m\u00e4eedah :32 . Islam dont tell us to kill the nonmuslim. Oh mh god, how can people backbite muslim like this. In islam, nonmuslim that live together along with muslim is protected. Their blood is haram as muslims. It is prohibited to kill them, or even just injure them. Dont ever do that. Women dignity is raised in islam. One of best man is the ones who being the most kind to his wife. We must behave good and kind, no harrash words to our parents, speak to them with a good words and patiently, especially to mum. Prophet muhammad said to mum, to mum again, to mum again after that to dad. And hijab, is used to protect woman from men's bad deeds, and evil eyes, plus also to make the women's unseen body part as the special thing to husband. Hijabi women is like a nice very expensive jewelry which is wrapped specially and cannot be seen and touch by everyone (only the enough rich person who wills to buy it  that can touch it), compared to a cheap fake jewelry that everybody can touch it.  Islam dont force the nonmuslims to embrace islam. The conversion to islam is only based upon the heart. No force at all.  The nice thing about islam, is that you can pray whereever, we can pray together with every that comes from all ocer the world, because we pray in the same language. It is not happen with other religion in the world. Islam is the only religion on which name is mentioned in the holy book. Please look for word 'buddhis religion' in its holy book, or 'christianity' or 'catolicism' in bible, gospel, old and new testament, you will not find any of them, except islam in their holy book. Aah so many thing that you must know about islam, but i have no time now. You have read quran, and please find a proof that i am totally wrong. There are  always misunderstanding to islam, and you have to proof it yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "All religions have a logic peculiar to their own, most logical of them all seems to be Buddhism and Hinduism. These two religion spent extra-ordinary effort on developing logical constructs around their belief systems. Maybe a better term is Logic-based, not Logical here because these two religions took extra-ordinary steps to create logic based branches of themselves.  Nyaya school of hinduism and Pramanavada of Buddhism are truly fine examples of these \"Logic-based\" religious thinking.  As to scientific method, a lot of other answers point out a basic fact which is No mass religion in the world has scientific proof on its side. All creation myths and such if taken at face value only serve to insult the intelligence of 95 percent of humanity (including most believers who long ago concluded all these stories to be \"metaphorical\"). There does not exist a single shred of physical evidence to prove any religious beliefs, this is a fact one needs to get used to, this is true regardless of religion we analyse. Some interesting questions to ponder with that in mind: Do we believe in something that has no scientific proof? Sure we do it all the time, think of love or loyalty or filial piety.Do we believe in things that are illogical? Sure, voting for political candidates hoping for a real change (considering the odds of that happening) or value in spending our precious little time on earth with hatred and jealousy or investing in corporate rat race knowing well no one becomes rich working for others. Lack of scientific proof does not mean much.. we still do not have evidence of \"Mass\" at the core level yet we observe it everywhere... hence the search for Higgs Boson. Lack of scientific proof as to what really \"causes\" mass to function the way it does, does not prevent universe to operate as such.  This is a reverse Schrodinger cat argument in a manner of speaking, our observation of the cat reduced uncertainty and forced determinism in Schrodinger's story. In reality however our knowledge or lack there of, of phenomenon does not prevent or allow it to function. Fact that we discovered our sun to be another Star did not make it a Star that very instance from some amorphous unknow-able quantum state. Absence of evidence does not indicate evidence of absence so lack of scientific evidence at any point in time should not be used as a \"measure\" of a religion. ",

The main goal of Buddhism is Nirvana, which is a transcendent state in which there is neither suffering, desire, nor sense of self, and the subject is released from the effects of karma and the cycle of death and rebirth. To achieve the state of Nirvana you must do have to followings: Right View: our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death.Right Resolve or Intention: the giving up of home and adopting the life of a religious mendicant in order to follow the path; this concept aims at peaceful renunciation, into an environment of non-sensuality, non-ill-will (to loving kindness), away from cruelty (to compassion)Right Speech: no lying, no rude speech, no telling one person what another says about him to cause discord or harm their relationship.Right Conduct or Action: refraining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct.Right Livelihood: Gaining one's livelihood by benefiting others also not selling weapons, poisons or intoxicants.Right Effort: preventing the arising of unwholesome states, and generating wholesome states.Right Mindfulness: being mindful of dhammas (teachings) that are beneficial to the Buddhist path.Right Samadhi (concentration): practicing the four stages of meditation.",

            "answer_text": "Religion usually amounts to a claim that reality is more than the sum of its parts and that there is an invisible, supreme force above and beyond the known universe that affects everything and guides our destinies. Such a thing may happen to be true, but apart from anecdotal evidence, there is no reason to believe that it is true. It is a continuing delusion from which mankind will probably never be free. That being the case, if one is going to pay attention to religion at all, he should ask what it says about reality and what its implications are for the problem of suffering. Spinoza\u2019s philosophy, as I understand it, more or less identifies the Supreme Being with the universe itself. That\u2019s all very well, but it seems to make a Supreme Being superfluous. Hinduism, though having thousands, even millions, of gods, posits an underlying reality in Brahma that unifies everything, an ocean of being into which individual personalities eventually dissolve, when they pierce the veil of illusion and achieve enlightenment. Hinduism also attributes human and animal suffering, as I understand it, to karma, an accounting for bad deeds in a previous life. The goal of human life is to pursue enlightenment, breaking free from the cycle of karma, even though this may take thousands of lifetimes. C.S. Lewis said that if he were not a Christian, he might have embraced Hinduism. Buddhism says there may be gods, but they are not relevant to the purpose of Buddhism, per se, which is to come to know one\u2019s true self and to break free of the chain of karma and enter nirvana in one lifetime, instead of many, as taught by the Hinduism from which Buddhism is derived. Buddhism attributes suffering to illusion and attachments. Stoicism, an ancient philosophy that is enjoying new popularity in our day, also stresses freedom from attachments and inner composure in meeting the vagaries and mischances of life. Marcus Aurelius wrote: Either there is a fatal necessity and invincible order, or a kind Providence, or a confusion without a purpose and without a director. If then there is an invincible necessity, why dost thou resist? But if there is a Providence which allows itself to be propitiated, make thyself worthy of the help of the divinity. But if there is a confusion without governor, be content that in such a tempest thou hast in thyself a certain ruling intelligence. And even if the tempest carry thee away, let it carry away the poor flesh, the poor breath, everything else; for the intelligence at least it will not carry away. The three Abrahamic monotheisms\u2014Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\u2014claim that there is one god (though Christianity confuses the issue with its doctrine of the trinity), that He is all-powerful, all-wise, and all-holy, that humanity fails to live up to his pure moral standard, and that we may be made acceptable to God by right belief, right practice, or, in the case of Christianity, being \u201cborn anew\u201d by faith in Jesus. The last two of these faiths claim to supersede the first, while Islam claims to supersede the first two. The inescapable problem of monotheistic faiths is that an all-powerful and all-wise god must have created humanity knowing the suffering that would follow and, thus, becoming ultimately responsible for it. Ironically, so far from his creatures needing to repent to him, it is he who owes them an apology for having created them in the first place. An interesting variation on all this is the philosophy expressed in a 40-page essay, The Lazy Man\u2019s Guide to Enlightenment, by Thaddeus Golas, written about 40 years ago. Golas says that the universe is made up of one kind of thing, that everything is alive, and that enlightenment comes from loving acceptance of reality as it is. One may be in heavenly bliss right now merely by accepting everything in life; conversely, if one is in a state of terrible suffering, it is something he has done to himself through his thoughts, even though he may not realize it. The Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment - Wikipedia The text has often been available free online, and reading it is an interesting thought experiment. Again, the two basic questions facing any religion are What is reality?Why is there suffering?Reality is either nothing but energy and matter or, no matter how it seems, there is \u201csomething more,\u201d invisible, powerful, irresistible, its actions unknowable. Suffering happens either because of the mysterious and unfathomable purposes of a Supreme Being or because sh*t happens. Religions are valuable as records of humanity\u2019s attempts to come to grips with these two issues. Almost all of these attempts were unsuccessful and should be abandoned except as historical curiosities. ",

            "answer_text": "Religions seemed to be closely associated with superstitious practices and dogmatic beliefs, and behind it lay a method of approach to life's problems which is certainly not that of science. There is an element of magic about it, and uncritical credulousness, a reliance on the supernatural. The question is very interesting inasmuch as basisof discussion is fixed for:  not which religion  but what religion which has to be logical andwhy Before I proceed further, let me clarify thatall religions are governed by faith in what has been stipulated in relevant scriptures.Such being the case, there cannot be Logic. In short there has to be eitherfaith or logic hence what isappropriate question. In the interest of further discussion, it is pertinent todefine the word Religion. There are number definitions; but in order tofacilitate the answer of \u2018What\u2019 religion, one has to look for appropriate references.The founder of Buddhism, Siddhartha\u2019s quote is:  Do not dwell in the past; do not dream of the future;concentrate the mind on the present moment. Please note that Buddha has not spoken of the faith, rites or rituals.He has spoken of worldly wisdom: (Logicand religion in practical sense.) Another quote concerning Logic is that of(late) Martin Luther King jr:  Then theyoungest Nobel Laureate: Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing forothers?' As is well known fact that King had been murdered for his pursuit ofdoing whatever he could do for others. In view of the foregoing, it must be appreciated that all the points: WHAT; RELIGION; LOGIC and WHY incoporatedin the question are adequately covered. Let me summarize the answer: As life\u2019s persistent and urgent question \u2013motto - is to do what you canfor others, the logic demands (that) not to dwell in the past; not dream in thefuture; but concentrate the mind on the present moment.

Science- the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behavior of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. Yet it's just humans putting stuff together to create other stuff and observe stuff that was already there. Basically figuring out where we're at and what does what.  Stuff God already knows, he set the laws of gravity of everything and he can take them apart. In my belief he has done so in the past will do whatever he chooses in the future. It pointless wasting time trying to figure out what we can't understand. It's so much more to comprehend, we will never be able too. And that's guarantee, especially in our current imperfect human state.  And the best logical religion? Religion- the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods. I believe that's a personal decision.  We're all raised differently and our past makes us up into who we are today. It's whatever you took as a baby, teenager and an adult that makes your decision. It created Your heart condition. To understand what you want to understand and hate what you want to hate or disagree with.  Me personally I am who I am because of my God. And I identify my self with the people that he brought me to. I see these people and it's a brotherhood with upright values. They truly do care for one another. Prolly the best solution for you is to pray to whatever you believe is out there and see who he sends you.  You can find my beliefs on JW.org. ",

            "answer_text": "Religions are made illogical the way that we twist them The true religion teachings teach compassion, patience, feeding the hungry, defending the oppressed, self-constraint, forgiveness; those should bring people together and should transform earth into a paradise The manipulated teachings are based on boasting, promote hatred, skepticism, lack of faith and unnecessary conflicts There is only one God who has revealed the same message to all prophets. The same message revealed to the prophets by the same God must be consistent Although the core religion teachings guide us to believe in God and to do good deeds to help others, scholars of each religion have distorted some teachings in order to claim that their religion is the only true religion and that they have the only way for salvation. Jewish scholars teach that Jews are the chosen people of God Christian Scholars teach that they are the predestined, the glorified, and the chosen before the creation of the world Muslim Scholars teach that Jews are cursed, Christians are misguided, and that Muslims are the truly guided people (they should have taught that the Muslims who do not follow the prophets\u2019 teachings are also cursed) Brahmins teach that God created them from his mouth to glorify them and created some other castes from his feet to let them serve the Brahmins - \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 1 They wanted to indoctrinate people that the bad caste discrimination is ordained by God; that is how Hindu priests manipulate the Hindu scripture to their benefits. All those scholars are not teaching the core message that God has revealed to the prophets. The common ground of religion teachings includes: In obedience and repentance is your salvation, if you obey and do good deeds, you will be blessed, if you disobey you will be lost; that is the clear message. That message is the most consistent message by Moses, confirmed by Jesus and by Islamic teachings It would not be accurate to say that Judaism is the right religion because there are many additions and changes to what God has revealed to Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, etc. It would not be accurate to say that the current teachings of Christianity are the true religion because most of the current teachings are the attractive teachings which are not consistent with the strict teachings of Jesus. It would not be accurate to say that all the current teachings of Islam are the true religion because there are many teachings which contradict the core verses of Qur\u2019an. Prophets did not teach that God has preserved the holy book; they have advised that there would be changes and have warned of such additions and manipulation. Amos 8:11-12 teach that People will be thirsty for the true word of God but they will not find it anywhere Psalm 56:5 teaches \u2018All day long they twist my words\u2019 Jeremiah 8:8 teaches the lying pen of the scribes has distorted the word of God Jeremiah 5:30-31 teach that the priests have distorted the religion teachings and that the people love those distorted teachings People are confused by the contradicting teachings, they try to search the internet for the true word of God, but they find many distorted teachings Instead of the true teaching \u2018You shall not murder \u2018in Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy 5:17 The scribes who glorify defeating their enemies ignored the true teaching and added some verses to justify the killing like Exodus 23:23, Numbers 31:16-18, Joshua 6:20-21, Judges 15:14-16 and Judges 16:30 Instead of \u2018Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore\u2019 in Isaiah 2:4, they have justified atrocities. Instead of the true and most consistent teachings of \u2018blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 in Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 28, Deuteronomy 11:26-28, Deuteronomy 4:40, Deuteronomy 6:24-25, Deuteronomy 7:12-15, and Deuteronomy 8, they teach that God has chosen them regardless of their obedience as in the distorted teachings of Deuteronomy 9:5-6 and Deuteronomy 7:6-8 Jewish scholars teach that Jews are the unconditionally chosen people of God; that is wrong according to the teachings of Moses like Exodus 19:5, Leviticus 18:4-5, Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 11:18-20, 11:26-28 , Deuteronomy 28, Deuteronomy 30:15-16 , and Deuteronomy 30:19, Deuteronomy 32:46-47 Moses did not teach that the Jews are the only chosen people; the correct definition of the chosen people of God as taught by Moses is an open invitation to each person to be a chosen son of God by obedience, by maintaining justice, by applying one measure or one law for Jews and Non-Jews, for taking care of the orphans, the widows, and the strangers Jewish scholars do not teach the original teachings anymore; they teach the distorted teachings of Deuteronomy 9:5-6 and Deuteronomy 7:6 in order to claim that God has chosen them regardless of the condition of obedience Those claims were not taught by Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, or by the Prophets; those prophets have warned of the wrong teachings When Jacob\u2019s descendants wanted to glorify him, they claimed that he wrestled with God and was saved. The verses in Genesis 32:24-30 teach that Jacob was able to wrestle with God; he said to God \"I will not let you go unless you bless me\u201d Instead of the true and strict teachings of Jesus in Matthew 7:21-27, Luke 13:25-27, Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Matthew 25:35-45, Mark 12:28-34, Mark 10:17-19, Matthew 19:16-19, Luke 18:18-20, Luke 6:46-48, John 14:15 and John 14:21 most Christian scholars like to boast and teach the attractive teachings like Romans 8:30, 1 Thessalonians 5:9, Ephesians 2:5, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16, Colossians 2:14 and Ephesians 1:4 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of atonement, they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:10-14 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who did not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teaches that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without a blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teaches that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood. When the scribes and scholars wanted to gain more authority, they added verses like Mark 16:15 and Matthew 28:18 Bible footnotes confirm that [The earliest manuscripts and some other ancient witnesses do not have verses Mark 16:9\u201320] Just search the bible footnotes or search the internet about the verses Mark 16:9\u201320 - you will also find that Matthew gospel includes many verses of Mark gospel which was written earlier When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of Trinity; they have added verses like 1 John 5:7 \u201cFor there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one\u201d The bible footnotes explain that verse 1 John 5:7 was not in the original old scriptures. The bible footnotes show many other additions in King James Version which were added to support the claims of the trinity and which were not in the old scripture; examples are: In I John 4:3 \u2018CHRIST is come in the flesh\u2019 is an addition In Matthew 8:2, 9:18, 15:25, 18:26, 20:20, Mark 5:6 the word \u2018bow down' was changed to \u2018worshiped\u2019. Jesus referred to himself as \u201cson of man\u201d. Jesus was not all-knowledgeable and he prayed to GOD, so this is enough to say that he wasn\u2019t God nor did God come down to earth to be Jesus. Jesus said, \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that they might know You the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.\u201d John 17:3 Jesus said that he does not know everything; he said that only God knows But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father Mark 13:32 Jesus said that he is not equal to God \u201cI can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.\u201d John 5:30 Jesus said, \u201cThe Father is greater than I.\u201d John 14:28 \u201cJesus answered them, and said, my doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.\u201d John 7:16 Jesus prayed to God as written in Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, John 17:11, Matthew 26:39, Luke 10:21, Luke 22:44 \u201cmy Father and your Father; my God and your God\u201d John 20:17 The disciples did not pray to Jesus, they prayed to the God and Father of Jesus \u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\u2026\u201d 1 Peter 1:3 The Muslim scholars who justify killing of innocent people are not true Muslims because they do not obey the Qur\u2019an verses like 5:32, 4:90, 2:190, 8:61, 17:33, 25:68 and 6:151 which teach \u2018You shall not kill - God has made life sacred\u2019 The Muslim scholars who teach to kill the unbelievers are mistaken; verse 9:6 is enough proof for their mistakes, because Muslims are supposed to protect the unbelievers and they cannot protect them after killing them The Muslims who justify killing of those who leave Islam are mistaken because they do not obey the Islamic teachings like Qur\u2019an verses 2:256, 16:125 and 18:29 which teach Freedom of Religion The Muslim scholars who justify the killing of the hostages are mistaken; verse 8:70 proves that the hostage is not to be killed, because Muslims are supposed to comfort the hostages and they cannot comfort them after killing them The Muslim scholars who teach that Islam is the only true religion are mistaken; they have been ordered to believe in what has been revealed to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets as taught in Qur\u2019an verses 3:84, 4:136, 4:152 and 42:13 The Muslim scholars who teach that the fate of people had been determined before they were born and before they had any chance to do good or bad are mistaken; they ignore the basic Qur\u2019an verses like 4:147, 4:152, 6:48, 6:54, 17:15, 45:15,43:72, 16:35, 19:63, 19:76, 20:112, 34:50, 37:39, 39:41, 39:70, 40:17, 47:17, 55:60, 56:24, and 18:107 The verses teach that God does not predestine people\u2019s fate but gives them the choice either to obey and do good deeds or to rebel and do evil deeds; there is no punishment for those who choose to obey and to thank God. Brahmins urge simple people to donate and offer generous gifts to the Brahmins claiming that people will get hundred-thousand-fold rewards \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 7 An offering to Brahmins saves from misfortune and from great guilt. \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 3 Brahmin sanctifies any company (which he may enter), seven ancestors and seven descendants, and he alone deserves (to possess) this whole earth \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 1 Chapter 7 teaches that Kings should honor Brahmins, should be lenient towards Brahmins, and should consult them in important decisions and should always obey them Hindu priests teach that money given to Brahmins is declared to be an imperishable treasure for kings Chapter 8 teaches that Brahmins are the masters of everything and authorizes Brahmins to decide in justice and law matters Chapter 9 provides exceptional inheritance rights to Brahmins Chapter 11 entitles Brahmins to take the law into their own hands and settle the disputes without referring to law and justice system of other castes Brahmin is the image of God and is the master of all castes \u2013 Laws of Manu Chapter 2 and 10 Bhagavad Gita indoctrinates the military leaders to obey the Brahmins even if the military leaders were asked to kill their family members The clear message to the military leaders is not to attach to a family or anything other than being a disciple to obey the orders of Brahmins as an honor and duty More Gods mean more temples. More temples mean more donations, offerings, and generous gifts to Brahmins. Moses warned of the expected turning from the way he has commanded Jews, in Deuteronomy 31:27-29 he used strong words like \u201cFor I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against God while I am still alive and with you, how much more will you rebel after I die!\u201d And \u201cFor I know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of God and arouse his anger by what your hands have made\u201d Jesus has warned the priests who spend more time in the houses of widows. In Matthew 23:14 he said \u201cWoe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation\u201d In Matthew 7:15-20, Jesus warned of the false teachers who mislead people Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves The same teaching is also written in Luke 6:43-44 As Moses and Jesus warned of the false teachers who explain religion to their benefits, the prophet of Islam has also warned of those who ignore the true teachings and teach different teachings \u201cI will say those people are from me. It will be said, 'You do not know what changes and new things they did after you.' Then I will say, 'Far removed (from mercy), far removed (from mercy), those who changed (the religion) after me!\u201d That is recorded in Bukhari 7051 Book 92, Hadith 4 and in Volume 9, Book 88, Hadith 174 The best advice is to follow the common ground of the clear teachings as taught by the prophets. The same message revealed to the prophets by the same God must be consistent, clear and easy for all people regardless of their level of education or experience The common ground of religion teachings includes: If you obey and do good deeds to help others then you will be saved and blessed; if you disobey, you will be lost and cursed; that is the clear message. That message is the most reiterated message by the wise inspired teachers, Moses, David, Solomon, Isaiah, confirmed by Jesus and by Islamic teachings How can you validate my claims? The best advice is to ask God to guide us to the truth. The door is open for everyone to experience divine intervention The wise and merciful father keeps his door open for his children God has more wisdom and mercy than any wise merciful father People can communicate with God at any time Prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have urged us to ask God and taught that God answers the prayers of the obedient believer. Example verses are: Psalm 107:28-30, Psalm 18:6, Psalm 145:18, 2 Chronicles 7:14, Isaiah 58:9 Matthew 7:7, Mark 11:24, Luke 6:27-28, James 4:2, Qur\u2019an 2:186, Qur\u2019an 40:60 Even if you are agnostic, you should not have a problem accepting a creator for that marvelous universe, pray to that God. Agnostics do not deny the existence of a creator, they do not like the wrong religion teachings and the bad priests who reap the financial gifts in exchange of the alleged spiritual gifts. Do not call any name like the God of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism, just pray to the only true God who has created everything. Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. I have spent years wondering about what the purpose of life is. I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam and prayed to God to guide me to the truth. I had some doubts about the teachings of a certain teacher, I have prayed to God to guide me to the truth I saw in a very clear dream that teacher in a form of a criminal prisoner, has committed evil, waiting for his trial. In another dream I saw a wolf hiding after attacking sheep; I understood that message as the bad teacher who try to mislead people by the bad teachings as Jesus explained in Matthew 7:15-20 \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\u201d. I also remembered the Parable of the Weeds in which Jesus warned us about the enemy who insert false teachings into the scripture in Matthew 13:24-43 \u2018an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat\u2019 Pray and ask God to guide you about the teacher who claims that God does not exist; you will see him in a bad image Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who teaches that Jesus is God Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who claims that God tests us in this life and will reward us according to our obedience and good deeds Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who taught original sin, atonement, salvation not based on obedience but taught free salvation by a savior to die for our sins Pray to God to know the truth about the priests who teach that God created them from his mouth to glorify them and created some other casts from his feet to let them serve the Brahmins Pray to God to know the truth about the priests who teach that it is o.k. to worship Vishnu, Shiva, Rama, or Krishna If you see good roads, green views, good food that could be explained as the true path and the spiritual food If you see those priests in bad images, dirty roads, or rotten food those could be indicators about the bad path of the false teachers and their bad fruits (wrong teachings and deeds) You do not have to accept my views; you may check and analyze the mentioned verses You do not have to accept my claims about communication with God; try to establish your own communication You do not have to accept my personal experience; you know how to communicate with God and it will be your own personal experience Even if you are agnostic, you should not have a problem accepting a creator for that marvelous universe, pray to that God. Do not call any name like the God of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, or Hinduism, just pray to the only true God who has created everything. Again, do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. Isaiah 58:9 \u2018Then you will call, and God will answer, you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Which is the most logical and scientific religion? Bottom line all ancient and contemporary religions are based on very old ideas rooted in an era of scientific ignorance. What does it mean to say that something is logical?Logic is a rigorous and and formal way of thinking. Its goal is to provide the rules to determine if a statement is true given the truth value of other statements. We can call something logical when it makes use of logic and does not violate any rules of logic. That makes that mathematics is logical and most of technology and science too. Wat does it mean for something to to be scientific?Science is a method. It starts with a falsifiable hypothesis. Puts it to the test and does so repeatedly. If evidence cumulates and all points in the same direction, eventually a hypothesis or set of hypotheses becomes accepted as a theory. Science uses logic, experiments and observations as tools for building a body of knowledge about reality. How about religion?None of the world religions has the main goal to build a body of knowledge based on falsifiable claims. Religions have a focus on traditions, rituals, community building, meditation, supernatural experiences and in some cases even blind faith in fact about the world. How about eastern religions?I address the specific claim that some people make that Buddhism or Hinduism are scientific. The arguments starts from the weaker claim that they are less dogmatic, more like a philosophy, and do not require believe in supernatural beings, making them compatible with science.  However claiming that Buddhism is scientific because it doesn't  contradict science is faulty logic. Music and art don't contradict science but we don't consider Bach or van Gogh as scientific.Core concepts like Brahman Atman karma and philosophical ideas about the nature of time do not fit with the contemporary scientific ideas. And these religions do not aim to scrutinize and test their ideas to adjust and build on them. Since none of the regions qualifies for being called logical and scientific we cannot say which one is the \u201cmost\u201d logical and scientific. ",

            "answer_text": "OK, I\u2019ll first rule out any religion requiring faith in the existence of a deity, because that is not logical. I don\u2019t know how many that leaves us with, but the only ones I am personally aware of are Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Unitarian Universalism, and Scientology. Scientology we can exclude because it requires faith in the existence of a whole bunch of ridiculous stuff. It\u2019s a pay-as-you-go program, as much a religion as Esperanto is a language. Confucianism is a rational, prescriptive, almost Aristotelian religion. Taoism is more mystical as an approach to apprehending the meaning of life and the universe. Buddhism is actually a vast spectrum of religious practices, encompassing individual mystical experience at one end but also fairly rigid liturgy at the other. Universalism is an umbrella religion encompassing many belief systems\u2014some religious and some not\u2014and wrapping them in a churchlike community. But in the big picture, none of them can be seen as logical, because religion is not intended to answer questions in a logical way, it is intended to help people find their place in the world and in society through belief. After all, every logical argument begins with assumptions or premises that are outside logic, and that is where religion operates. If you just want to be logical, then try agnosticism (since any attempt either to prove or disprove the existence of a deity is illogical), and pile science and mathematics on top of it. ",

I will explain first why the others are not. Abrahamic religions have no logic because a loving omnipotent creator god would not have created 2 offshot religions to go against Judaism and subsequently fought among themselves. In fact, Judaism was created by copying part of Hinduism and Jesus story was copied from Buddha. Moreover, a creator god religion should be the oldest. So Hinduism is more logical. At least, their claims are not logic-defying. Buddhism is considered most logical and scientific too because their beliefs of karma and rebirth are totally coherent with science's action/reaction theory and energy theory. By right, one should not say Buddhism is scientific but should say science is Buddhistic since Buddhism is earlier. Science merely confirmed their beliefs. ",

            "answer_text": "IMO, any religion that considers itself fully logical should contain the following foundational principles to be consistent and compatible with both scientific knowledge and thousands of years of human experience :  we - as individuals - are insignificant in the giant scheme of things. Collective interests should always come before individual interests.we - as individuals - will always be limited in our knowledge of the universe/nature. However, if the word \"God\" is to have any meaning at all, we should say that God = nature = the universe.anything that cannot be explained by science either today or in the future is something of which one can never truly know anythingone can experience the highest degree of spirituality only when abandoning one's ego completelythere are many paths towards enlightenmentthe hardest path towards enlightenment is often the most rewardingthe path taken is more important than the ultimate destinationlearning from your mistakes is more important than not making anythere is nothing more important than loving those close to youone should seek neither abstinence nor indulgence but rather a very individualized balance between both extremesThe following text is an excerpt from The Perennial Philosophy by Aldous Huxley :  At the core of the Perennial Philosophy we find four fundamental doctrines. First: the phenomenal world of matter and of individualized consciousness--the world of things and animals and men and even gods--is the manifestation of a Divine Ground within which all partial realities have their being, and apart from which they would be non-existent. Second: human beings are capable not merely of knowing about the Divine Ground by inference; they can also realize its existence by a direct intuition, superior to discursive reasoning. This immediate knowledge unites the knower with that which is known. Third: man possesses a double nature, a phenomenal ego and an eternal Self, which is the inner man, the spirit, the spark of divinity within the soul. It is possible for a man, if he so desires, to identify himself with the spirit and therefore with the Divine Ground, which is of the same or like nature with the spirit. Fourth: man's life on earth has only one end and purpose: to identify himself with his eternal Self and so to come to unitive knowledge of the Divine Ground. The following is an excerpt from the Principia Discordia, by Gregory Hill and Kerry Wendell Thornley :  The Aneristic Principle is that of apparent order; the Eristic Principle is that of apparent disorder. Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of pure chaos, which is a level deeper than is the level of distinction making. With our concept-making apparatus called \"the brain\" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us.The ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled \"reality\" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see \"reality\" differently. It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T) True reality is a level deeper than is the level of concept.We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). Different philosophies use different grids. A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The order is in the grid. That is the Aneristic Principle. Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be true. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the Aneristic Illusion. Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other. Disorder is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid. But, like \"relation\", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is \"absence of female-ness\", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. The artificial concept of no-relation is the Eristic Principle. The belief that \"order is true\" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the Eristic Illusion.The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered. Reality is the original Rorschach. Verily! So much for all that. \u2014Malaclypse the Younger, Principia Discordia, Pages 00049\u201300050   Artwork by Alex Grey ",

Its as if you are looking at the ground, when you should be looking up into the sky.  You've set yourself up to fail. Christianity is logical and rational.  CS Lewis made a number of logical cases for the Christian faith.  And there have been a number of others since who have made the case including Frank Turek and Alister McGrath.  All three of these make a logical case for the Christian faith. The idea that humans and the process of evolution sprung from a void or nothingness is absurd.  The idea that information (including information organization and information storage--a la DNA) just happened to evoled in the way it did is absurd.  The idea that the human mind (including deliberation and consciousness) evolved without guidance from a Designer, from the apes is incredibly absurd.  It turns all of reality from a Divine plan into an absolute accident.  But an accident that's an absolute miracle.  So, at some level, one is ultimately compelled to admit the miraculous nature of what we have versus what we started with. ",

            "answer_text": "I will seek to answer this by stating that logic and truth cannot be found outside of the Christian God. Given the existence of God, one can ground truth and logic in God\u2019s nature in of itself. This is to say that God is the foundation for truth and logic. Why? Because Titus 1:2 God cannot lie, and Numbers 23:19 God is not a man, that He should lie, Nor a son of man, that He should repent. If what is being said comes directly from God, we know that it is truthful especially given that God is all good. Keep in mind, not all things come from God. Moreover, God is all knowing. He has the attributes that makes logic and reason possible. To say that reason and logic do not come from God get you into trouble. Okay fine, then where does logic and reason come from? Most will say human beings. I think then that it would follow that logic and reason become subjective and you have killed all logic and reason altogether. Why? Think of it this way - I say 2+2=4 and you say that 2+2=57. But if logic is invented, then both of these answers are equally true because it comes down to the individual. So I argue that your best chance is to say that logic and reason come from outside of human beings. If not God, then where? I leave that for you to decide because I have offered a way out of the dilemma. To argue against my argument presupposes that that there is actually truth and logic. Hold on, where does your reason and logic come from? Unless you ground it in God, you cannot by definition argue or debate to begin with because there is no reason to think something is true. You cannot get your argument off of the ground. You have to borrow from a worldview where there is logic to do logic, i.e., my own. You need God to argue otherwise it is all relative. Finally, to say that there is no truth is to commit a contradiction, namely that it is TRUE that there is no truth. Lol. Romans 1 says that all people know that God exists because of nature (knowing that this is not a happy coincidence) and through our sense of morality, i.e., everyone has a basic understanding of morality. This basic understanding of morality points toward a creator who endowed us with a moral code, and looking to the outside world shows that it had to be designed. ",

Personally, I regard most of the \u2018Abrahamic\u2019 religions as illogical, as belief in them does rely on a fair amount of \u2018doctrinal cherry-picking\u2019, so the most logical religions to me, are ones that people within them opening question, and believe in on a sceptical level, rather than a religion which people blindly accept. I know this doesn\u2019t provide an explicit answer, but it is unfair (and inaccurate) to refer as one religion as \u2018the most logical\u2019. ",

While I am a Bible-believing Christian, I am going to say that most realistic religion in the world is atheism, which posits that what you simply see, hear, and otherwise perceive of the world through empirically verifiable means is really and truly all there is to reality. Religion, however, generally posits that there is indeed something more to the nature of reality than the limits empirical awareness would otherwise suggest, and that this extra aspect is furthermore something that does not even make sense when one tries to explain it through the limitations of that narrower attempt at perception. The atheist is like a person who walks around with one eye shut and insists to everybody that there are only two axes of spatial awareness. In the absence of any willingness to embrace faith, the atheist insists that there is no further depth to the nature of a person\u2019s existence. Thus, if you want you want be realistic, stick to atheism. But if you want to know what life is really about, consider embracing faith. ",

One cannot logic a god into existence or use logic to build a castle\u2014except in the air. Without a god, there is no religion (unless you want to call it a \"cultural system,\" but that's without a deity as its head). And yet, all religions, like stories, tales, and fables, are logical within their own domain. So there is no \"most logical religion.\"  ____________ * Religions and spiritual traditions  The word religion is sometimes used interchangeably with \"faith\" or \"belief system\", but religion differs from private belief in that it has a public aspect. Most religions have organized behaviors, including clerical hierarchies, a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership, congregations of laity, regular meetings or services for the purposes of veneration of a deity or for prayer, holy places (either natural or architectural), and/or religious texts.

Anyone can claim they have the truth and their belief is the right one; if many people claim they have the truth and does not back it up, then we come into a stalemate. Those truth claims need to also conform to reality. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. (Genesis 1:1) With the Big Bang scientifically accepted as what actually happened at the creation of the universe, it conforms to what the Bible says - that the universe had a beginning. Other religions believe that the universe existed eternally in the past. This belief that the universe existed eternally does not conform to what is scientifically proven and real. About 2,000 years ago, there was a man who was born and lived and He claimed to be God - Jesus Christ. He actually lived - many sources apart from the Bible proves that Jesus actually lived. He talked differently; He acted differently; He did things no other humans have done before. He showed He is not just a mere mortal by performing miracles. He claimed to be God Himself. He claimed to forgive sins only God can forgive. He referred to Himself as \u201cI am.\u201d He claimed to be the way, the truth, and the life. No other sane human being claimed to be whom Jesus claimed to be and proved He can do so by performing miracles. Now, these claims of Jesus is something we need to decide on - Was Jesus a liar and a deceiver? Was He a crazy person - a lunatic? Or was He whom He claimed to be - Lord and God? Many people think that Jesus was a great moral teacher and stop at that, but Jesus never left that option to us. Jesus is either a great deceiver, or a crazy person, or He is God. The New Testament in the Bible is not just a religious document; it actually is a historical document. It accounts for the birth, the life, the actions, and the behaviour of Jesus and his followers. Some religions do not believe that Jesus actually died and rose again or believed that Jesus\u2019 body was stolen. Based on historical pieces of evidence we have, those claims do not make sense. So, my faith is not blind faith but based on good solid foundation - truth and reality. For more details, see the link here: How to falsify a religion using scientific or historical evidence ",

Of course, this attempt led to the unwanted discovery that the rational explanation of nature and the universe involved no god or creation.Also, certain elements of Oriental religions make some sense, philosophically speaking and are (religiously speaking) more evolved since they found that gods are more or less irrelevant/unimportant.

If so, I would say all world religions have some content that meets the definition of realistic in this question. However, if we define realistic as \u201ctrue without a rational doubt\u201d, I would argue no religion on earth can meet this definition. For example, take the two most subscribed major world religions on earth: Christianity and Islam. These two major world religions are contradictory. Therefore, either both are false or one is true and the other false.

If you read the New Testament with a critical eye, you\u2019ll recognize the handiwork of primates. For example, the New Testament authors transform one of the most ruthless and morally disordered members of human history into one of peaceful and ethical individuals. The name of this monster is Pontius Pilate. There is no most realistic religion in the world for all religions are produced by humanity and thus limited to human imagination, creativity and experience. Fin. ",

The demonstration might be very involved, and probably would make a whole host of other questions that could, and perhaps, ought to be asked. But initially, we could say a few things. Many religions assert that the world our senses perceive is an illusion, and our goal is to reach \u201creal\u201d reality. This is an understandable human reaction to suffering in the world. Catholicism, by contrast, asserts the world is real. Not only is suffering real, it also has value in light of the Cross. And to alleviate the suffering of another is an act of charity. Catholicism presents reasoned and time-tested answers to life\u2019s difficulties, without pretending they are illusory. It may be that the religions that call this life an illusion do so because of their inability to provide real solutions to real problems. ",

            "answer_text": "As per my intuition the most logical religion is the one which is able to fulfill the inside void of the person and at the same time is encompassing the whole universe in beautiful and beneficial way.The logical religion should have gratifying answers for the faithful regarding the beliefs,practices and rituals.The logical religion should describe the rights of not only the followers but of non believers ,other creatures and environment as well.The logical religion always stresses on empathy,harmony,humanity,justices,hope and above all the equality of humans. If the society is messed up because of the religion,then there is something wrong with the teachings or understanding of the religion. ",

            "answer_text": "I have to plug my church, the ELCA, because 1. We value everyone equally: the head of the church (currently) is a woman and there is an openly gay bishop in California. Our bishop (in southwest Michigan) is legally blind.2. We give a high percentage of our offering to outreach: we are not feathering our nest.3. Everyone is welcome here. We are not exclusive: you don't have to be Lutheran to have communion. We are not judgmental: we don't care what you wear or how much you give. You will find people with differing beliefs here: we are not dogmatic and we agree to disagree. We believe that people have the right to question aspects of their faith: Martin Luther did.4. Lutherans are involved in disaster relief all over the world and we have very small overhead compared to many charities. I personally was involved in Hurricane Katrina cleanup. Our pastor spent time in Haiti before coming to our church.  I also endorse the Salvation Army. I have a friend who has been in it for 40 years and she and her husband have lived all over the place. I respect them immensely. ",

            "answer_text": "Atheism. But they too are crazy because they don\u2019t believe in God and want to prove that God doesn\u2019t exist. Fact is, there is no proof that God doesn\u2019t exist so you can\u2019t rule it out. You can only say that the evidence in which we have right now is gear towards God not existing. You can\u2019t just down right say that God doesn\u2019t exist without proof. The fact that they keep parading that God doesn\u2019t exist without proof kind of defeat the purpose of being an Atheism. In a sense, Atheism is illogical like other religion as well. ",
