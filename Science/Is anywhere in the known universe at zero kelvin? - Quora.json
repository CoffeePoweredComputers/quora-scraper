            "answer_text": "The laws of thermodynamics indicate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means, because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically,[4] and a system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero. The kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed. Absolute zero - Wikipedia So, no, nothing in the universe is at 0 Kelvin and even if there was a way to achieve it, there would be zero-point kinetic energy of the ground state. -Ambi ",
