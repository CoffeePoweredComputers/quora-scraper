            "answer_text": "Orders of magnitude. The cross section for collision of protons is 100 mb (millibarns), which is a unit of area. A barn is[math] (10^{-12} \\text{ cm})^2[/math], so to have a high probability of collision, you have to focus the beams to with 10 femtometers. The beam spot size is amazing great, measured in micrometers (much smaller than a pin point. But the femtometer scale is so unimaginably small that it boggles the mind to think about \u2014 a billions times smaller than the micrometer scale. A billion times larger than the micrometer scale is the kilometer scale! So the micrometer scale is equidistance between the femtometer scale and the kilometer scale. The difference between a mountain and the spot size of the LHC is the same as the distance between the spot size of the LHC and the spot size necessary to have a good chance at interacting each time. In practice they put a trillion or so protons in two bunches that have a spots size measured in square micrometers and then recirculate a billion times or so. Fermi was one of the greatest physicists of all time. He proposed the weak interaction and the constant shares his name, [math]G_F[/math] \u2014 the Fermi constant, as does the distance scale \u2014 1 femtometer = 1 fermi. He thought that the physics of the weak interaction would forever be beyond the reach of colliders. The reason is that he could only envision fixed target experiments where you slam a beam of particles into a block of matter. This means that the energy of the collision only grows like the square root of the energy of the beam \u2014 and you\u2019d need an Earth-size accelerator to get to the weak scale. To think that you could focus beams of particles so precisely enough to get enough interactions to be meaningful was science fiction. Could you drop the spot size by a factor of 10? Maybe. Science fiction would be 1000 and that would still be the nanometer scale. And ultimately what would you get? Right now there are dozens of collisions each beam crossing. This is going to grow to a few hundred. But if you drop it by a factor of 10, you\u2019d end up with tens of thousands of collisions each time. That\u2019s an indecipherable mess. So you\u2019d end up putting fewer particles in bunch. So you wouldn\u2019t get any more data. It might save a bit on energy, but that\u2019s it. And all in the process of developing science fiction technology. ",

            "answer_text": "It takes many passages thru the accelerating field to get the protons up to maximum energy. The LHC accelerates the protons in bunches. Each bunch is about the diameter and length of a fine pencil lead. It contains about 5e14 protons. So the LHC doesn\u2019t attempt collide one proton with one proton. It is these bunches of protons that are focused to collide inside the detector section. Only a very few actually collide. Which is good because there is a lot of energy on the beam, about 8 million joules, roughly the kinetic energy of a freight train. At the end of a run the beams are deflected and dumped into ten ton graphite blocks which are surrounded by a thousand tons of steel and concrete shielding and is water cooled. The graphite blocks are raised to 1400degF. Graphite is used because the protons are absorbed over a distance,. ",
