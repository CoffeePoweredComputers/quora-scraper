            "answer_text": "The periodic table is significant for a variety of reasons. There are two main divisions groups (vertical columns) and periods (horizontal rows). It tells us about trends in reactivity. Atoms in the same group form ions with the same charge and follow trends in reactivity.It tells us about physical trends. Atoms in the same group follow trends in physical properties (eg. melting points increase down a group).It tells us about trends in ionization and electron affinity of atoms, and atomic radius. Ionization energy and electron affinity increase across a period, while atomic radius decreases across a period.It offers ways of understanding valency and balancing equations easily by looking at the groups where atoms lie.It tells us which atoms are more reactive than others based on their relative positions, and also which compounds have the strongest bonds.It offers an explanation for both covalent and ionic bonding.It tells us name, symbol, atomic number, and nucleon number. This tells us number of protons, electrons and neutrons, and many phenomenon can be explained using these 3 values.I\u2019m sure that there are many more uses for the periodic table but these are some that I could think of. Hope this answers your question. ",
