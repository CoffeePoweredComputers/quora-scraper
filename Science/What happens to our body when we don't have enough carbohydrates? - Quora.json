            "answer_text": "Many people avoid carbohydrates due to concerns about weight gain, but carbs are needed for the body to function. Carbohydrates are our body\u2019s main energy source and necessary for us to think and remain active. Skimping too much on carbohydrates can cause several health problems. Carbs are our body's preferred source of fuel, so keeping carbs out of our diet can make us feel pretty drained. That's one reason why dieters following a low-carb diet often experience a keto flu without enough carbs available, dieters feel tired and foggy, at least until their body starts burning more fat for energy. Hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar or low blood glucose, occurs when the glucose levels in the blood drop below normal. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include tiredness, weakness, light-headedness, confusion and hunger. Carbs are the main source of glucose because they are broken down into simple sugars during digestion and enter the cells with the help of insulin, providing energy. Eating a small amount of carbs will quickly treat hypoglycemia. Eating less than 130 grams of carbohydrates a day can cause a buildup of ketones, which are partially broken-down fats in the blood. When our body doesn\u2019t have enough glucose for energy, it breaks down stored fat, producing ketones. Mild ketosis can cause mental fatigue, bad breath, nausea and a headache, but severe ketosis can lead to painful swelling of the joints and kidney stones. Therefore, one can reduce the carbohydrate intake and consume a balanced proportion of proteins, good fats and other micronutrients but completely avoiding carbohydrates is not recommended. ",

            "answer_text": "Well to answer this we could say it can depend on a number of things you body does need carbs however sometimes when a person has been consuming to many carbs then the desired effect can be detrimental. It\u2019s a bit like saying consuming not enough sugar or salt can actually be harmful too however to much of those items then becomes harmful to our health also. So there needs to be a proper balance of the items spoken about here. If your still in the growing stage of life then yes too little intake of carbs can effect you because your still growing you need all that extra energy and is the reason why so many young people can get away with eating certain portions of carbs then can a much older person who does not need the energy. So what happens with a lack of carbs if your need them is you will lose energy you will find it hard to perform any kind of physical activity which is why you see long distance runners collapsing as they have not given their body the proper energy needed during the race, so the body does what it has to do once there is no more energy left to use the body shuts down and is the reason we see them collapse. On the other hand if a person has an excessive amount of stored fats on their body this is of course an energy source and by consuming less carbs the body can then utilize this untapped energy source. So in this case consuming less carbs can be a good thing but only until a person has lost the excessive amount of weight once their at an ideal BMI they should then increase their carb consumption to an appropriate level again. So just in conclusion consuming less carbs can be harmful if you are still in the growing stage of life between ages 6 - 16 , a pregnant woman, also if you are a hard working person or an athlete you need that energy source, however it is beneficial to consume less carbs if a person is trying to lose excessive amounts of weight or decrease high blood sugar levels.
