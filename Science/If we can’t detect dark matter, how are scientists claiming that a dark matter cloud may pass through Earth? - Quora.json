            "answer_text": "(FACTS OF DARK MATTER ) Lets keep answer simple and in points 1-Dark matter is that which we(ant sun asteroid human plant) are not made up of neither we can sense(see touch hear taste) 2-Scientists assumed presence of dark matter existence when they try to understand spinning of stars and galaxies only considering gravitational field effect of matter 3- Dark matter is considered because ,adding total gravitational effect of matter still not able to explain unexpected high speed spinning of stars (Observed value of spinning of star even galaxies different from theoretical value) 4-Dark matter is just as gravitational field effect without mass (ANSWER TO QUESTION) Now \u201cDetection of dark matter\u201d 1-In labs scientists try to create dark matter -In CERN we have world's largest particle accelerator and collider, where beam of protons at~ speed of light collide to recreate condition of big bang (scientists expect dark matter detection) 2-Using powerful multi spectral telescopes to watch sky in infrared, microwave, x ray,gamma ray vision 3-Effect of gravitational lensing(bending of light without any gravitational effect of known matter) of distant galaxies as captured by telescopes (Search for unusual radiation signal) 4-LUX lab where purest form of xenon(incredibly sensitive) detect dark matter -located several miles underground -Detects unusual particle decay results in gamma ray streakes of light (even faintest signal) (All these techniques to detect dark matter far from earth and also passing through and affecting earth) THANKS ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is, like with everything in science, because there is evidence. We cannot detect dark matter particles (yet?) but we can detect dark matter. Dark matter is not some unfounded fantasy in the minds of scientists. There is observational evidence of dark matter, for example from gravitational lensing effects. So we know where the dark matter is and how that is distributed in and around galaxies and other large matter concentrations. We can observe such a large matter concentration within our galaxy passing by us and so we know that this must also travel with its share of dark matter around it and through us. This will not have any detectable effect though because the density of that dark matter is still undetectably low. ",
