            "answer_text": "Suppose a man at rest at T=0 , then after two seconds he starts running with an acceleration of 1m/s^2 .  Then from which force this acceleration came into existence.? That's \u201cfriction\u201d which provides this acceleration and thus here the \u201c friction support the motion of the man\u201d , but when you check this motion at contact point of man's foot and ground then-   (You can visualise that when we moves forward, our foot moves in backward direction.) From the above picture you can see that , the velocity of foot with respect to ground (i.e. relative velocity) is in -x direction , so as we know that- \u201cFriction is a force which opposes relative motion or tendency of relative motion\u201d Hence, here to oppose the relative motion ,friction acts in +x direction and provides the acceleration to the man. Remember that, \u201cFriction may or may not opposes the motion but it always opposes relative motion\u201d ",
