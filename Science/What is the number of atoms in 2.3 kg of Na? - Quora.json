            "answer_text": "You can work this out for any pure element, gas or liquid from the definition of the Avogadro Number. That number is 6.022 x 10^23 and is the number of atoms (in an elemental form) or molecules (pure chemical compounds) in 1 gram-mole of a substance - ie, the atomic or molecular weight expressed in grams. In the case of 2.3 kg of Na the number of moles is 2300/22.99 from which you can calculate the number of atoms in the 2.3 kg of the metal. ",

            "answer_text": "Well if you try the question it is actually quite easy. The molar mass of Na is 23g/mol This means 23g Na is 1mol of Na.Thus 2300g of Na is= (1/23)\u00d72300=100mols.Here 2.3kg =2300g.Now 1mol Na has 6.022\u00d710^23 atoms.So 100 mol Na has 6.022\u00d710^25 atoms and that's the answer. :-) ",
