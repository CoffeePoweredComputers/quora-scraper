            "answer_text": "Harnessing Qi is achieved through a cultivation practice such as Neigong, but shaping Qi might mean different things to different practitioners. Speaking from my own experience, I have found that Qi does in fact manifest in what seems to be different shapes, and these seem to differ according to the Qigong posture or more specifically hand seal (mudra) one is practicing at the time. This is particularly prevalent in Bai Hu Pai Qigong (Bak Fu Pai) which makes considerable use of different Buddhist and Daoist hand seals. Aside from that, for the most part one tries to create a ball of Qi, which is obviously going to be round or spherical. That said, the practice of several of the internal arts forms (Taijiquan and Baguazhang for example) also produces Qi which follows the shape of certain symbols, particularly the Tai Chi (Yin/Yang symbol of opposites) symbol. I am not sure whether these forms were originally modelled around the energetic blueprint of these specific energy patterns, but this is how I experience them. ",
