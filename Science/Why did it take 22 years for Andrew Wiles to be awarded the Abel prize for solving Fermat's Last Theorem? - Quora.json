            "answer_text": "Simply, there were stronger candidates. Don\u2019t get me wrong - there would be very few mathematicians who would think that Wiles\u2019 contribution didn\u2019t merit the prize. Solutions to 400-years old problems are rare. However, that\u2019s not the only way how progress in mathematics happens. Suppose someone has a great idea that will eventually completely transform the way people think about some area of mathematics. As they publish it, some of the experts realize immediately how important the new approach is, others might not. Gradually, as more mathematicians pick up on the work, the importance sinks in. Known open problems are solved but also progress is made that people did not even think about before. The new idea becomes a part of a standard toolbox in the area, it gets into monographs and graduate level textbooks, possibly finds applications outside of mathematics\u2026 And the general public is completely unaware of any of this. Simply, there\u2019s no single point of these developments that would generate a newsworthy story. The whole area is likely way above undergrad math major level, so, even if someone tried to write a piece about that, it would sound like \u201cthe mathematicians made progress on something we cannot explain. What was the progress, we cannot explain either, but it\u2019s cool.\u201d Sounds lame compared to \u201cA mathematician solved x^n+y^n=z^n that blew minds for 400 years!\u201d As a result, the internal hierarchy of mathematicians is different from what it looks from outside, where solutions to old, easy-to-state open problems is pretty much the only thing that\u2019s visible. Before Wiles, three mathematicians who worked on number theory were awarded the Abel prize: Serre, Tate, and Deligne. All of them are giants with huge impact on the field, and it would be very questionable to award the prize to Wiles ahead of them; some might even argue that the same applies to Langlands. Then again, they cannot give all Abel prizes to number theorists. All in all, I would rather say that Wiles got it surprisingly early. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't have any direct knowledge of the considerations of the Abel prize committee, but I can guess. The Abel prize is a very new prize (established in 2001), and as with any new prize (and several old ones) there's a queue of great recipients who are well deserving and are old enough so that there's some urgency in bestowing the awards upon them.  The Nobel prize in literature is notorious for having a perennial \"backlog\" so it's awarded often very late in life, to the point that some hopeful candidates make a show of their deteriorating health to pressure the committee to pick them.   The Abel prize was awarded to some very senior mathematicians such as Serre, Nirenberg, Milnor and others. Presumably Wiles was always a candidate, but the committee wanted to make sure they don't miss out on recognizing some highly distinguished mathematicians born in the 1920's and 1930's.  John Forbes Nash was awarded the prize just a few days before his tragic death, at the age of 86.    ",
