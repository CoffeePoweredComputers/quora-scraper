            "answer_text": "It\u2019s pretty easy to calculate the number of atoms in any element of any mass. Here, Sulphur\u2019s molar mass is, [math]M[/math] = [math]32.065[/math] [math]g/mol[/math] The Avogadro number is, [math]N[/math] = [math]6.022*10^23[/math] [math]atoms/mol[/math] So, we can get the number of atoms per gram just by dividing the Avogadro number ([math]N[/math]) by the molar mass ([math]M[/math]). [math]N/M = (6.022*10^23) / 32.065 atoms/g[/math] [math]    = 1.87*10^22 atoms/g[/math] We have calculated the number atoms present in 1g of Sulphur. From here, we just need to multiply number of atoms per gram with the total number of grams to find the total number of atoms present. Hence, 8g of Sulphur will contain [math]8 * 1.87 * 10^22 atoms[/math] [math]                           = [/math][math]1.5 * 10^23 atoms[/math] ",

            "answer_text": "Sulphur has an atomic mass of 32.065 u and forms octoatomic molecules. Take the atomic mass in grams and the number of atoms in the sulfur molecule and multiply: so 8 x 32.065 grams = 256.52 grams. That iDVD the number of grams in one mole of sulfur. In each mole of anything there are Avogadro\u2019s number (6.022x10^23) of molecules. 8 grams of sulphur is 8grams / 256.52 grams per mole = 0.0312 moles. Now multiply that by Avogadro\u2019s number to get the number of molecules in 8 grams. 0.0312 moles x 6.022 x10^23 molecules per mole = 1.878864x10^22. Your question, though, was how many atoms, so you have to multiply that number which is how many molecules by 8 atoms per molecule of sulphur. So you get 1.503 x 10^23 atoms in 8 grams of sulfur.  You can search for any mathematical expression, using functions such as: sin, cos, sqrt, etc. You can find a complete list of functions here.
