            "answer_text": "I am guessing by breakdown you mean digestion, not the intracellular metabolic pathways. The digestive tract is full of water. Carbohydrates are soluble in water, a good example of which is the glucose in soft drinks. When you drink this, all that needs to be done in the intestine is absorb it into the blood. You can see a sharp rise in blood glucose after 30 min. Complex carbohydrates like starch are polymers of glucose. They are soluble enough in water to be attacked by digestive enzymes, and broken down, mainly to glucose. After that, glucose is absorbed. Fat, technically triglyceride, is insoluble in water, forming giant globules that have to be broken up, or emulsified (by bile acids and bile salts), before digestive enzymes can work on them. That is not the only problem. The breakdown products (fatty acids, monoglycerides) cannot be directly absorbed into the blood in large amounts because they have detergent properties and would damage tissues. Therefore, they have to go through an elaborate pathway inside intestinal cells to be re-synthesized into triglycerides and packaged as chylomicron particles. These are released into the blood (via the lymph), and eventually targeted to tissues, mainly adipose. It takes 3\u20134 hours to digest fat and release it into the blood as chylomicrons. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the carbohydrate. In general, lipids constitute a much more limited collection of structures than carbohydrates. There are some carbohydrates, such as cellulose, that are so difficult to digest that humans can\u2019t do it and need to rely upon certain bacteria to carry it out. Hence the gas. Lipids are not \u201charder\u201d to digest, they simply require a different route to absorption, that involves using a detergent (bile) to mix it into an emulsion, so the lipid droplets can be processed across cell membranes in a systematic way, and then into the blood in lipoprotein micelles called chylomicrons. Cholesterol is also shoved into the chylomicrons. Linear carbohydrates like starch are broken down rapidly in the acidic environment of the stomach, and enzymes cleave off units of glucose in the intestines. Galactose and Fructose are all essentially the same as glucose. They are all eventually converted to glucose in the liver. They absorb into the blood so rapidly, they bring water across with them. ",
