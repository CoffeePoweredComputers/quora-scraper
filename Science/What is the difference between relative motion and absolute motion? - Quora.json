            "answer_text": "Absolute motion is the motion of an object when viewed from a fixed point of observation(the position of an object does not change). Relative motion is the motion of an object when there is no fixed point of observation(the position of the observer changes with respect to time). To explain it in layman\u2019s terms: Imagine that you are standing on a footpath and watching all the cars passing by. You are the observer and your position is not changing as you are just watching cars go past you. Now, the motion of all the cars is absolute as the position of the observer is not changing. But, if you are sitting in a car and you watch a car overtake you. suppose you are driving at 20 m/s and the car that overtakes you is at 25 m/s. To you, it would seem like the car that just overtook you is at 5 m/s(cause it\u2019s travelling only 5 m/s more than your speed). But to another boy is is standing still on a footpath, the speed of the car would be 25 m/s. So, whose right? Both are right in their own perspective. The car is travelling at 5 m/s RELATIVE to you and at 25 m/s RELATIVE to the boy on the footpath. ",
