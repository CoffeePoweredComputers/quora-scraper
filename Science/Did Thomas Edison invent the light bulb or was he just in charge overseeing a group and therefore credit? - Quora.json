            "answer_text": "Edison did not invent the light bulb at all. Here is an explanation of Edisons contribution \u201c Edison realized that the problem with Swan's design was the filament. A thin filament with high electrical resistance would make a lamp practical because it would require only a little current to make it glow. He demonstrated his light bulb in December 1879. \u201c (from livescience.com) So Edison improved on Swan\u2019s design for light bulbs and Swann had used earlier designs and improved them. Around 1800 Volta ( Italian scientist after whom the unit Volt is named) demonstrated that copper wires could be made mto glow red hot and give out light 1802- Humphrey Davy (a British scientist ) developed the carbon arc lamp. 1840, Warren de la Rue (a British scientist) developed a lamp containing a coiled platinium filament. The platinium was too expensive to make this a comercial success 1848, William Staite ( a British electrical engineer) developed a clockwork mechanism to keep the length of the arc between the two carbon electrodes constant. This made the carbon arc lamp more reliable. 1860\u20131878 Joseph Swan worked on replacing the nplatinium filament by carbonised paper filaments. By 1878 he had a patent and his lamps were in use in public buildings certainly by 1880. 1874 Henry Woodward and Matthew Evans (canadian inventors) patented a design for a nitrogen filled lamp with a carbon rod filament. They faoiled to make this a comercial success and sold the patent to Edison in 1879 1880- Edison starts his Electric Light Company and has a team testing many materials to find the best for making carbon filaments. The eventually settled on bamboo. This resulted in a bulb which was both cheap and long lasting so comercially viable. From what I read, he was more of a manager than an inventor. He had what we would now call research laboratories with teams of people working on the solutions to various problems. He certainly did not invent the light bulb but was responsible for the team that produced the first inexpensive , long lasting light bulb. The light bulbs in use for most of my life had tungsten filaments. So if we are to ignore the work of the earlier inventors of light bulbs, we should also ignore Edison\u2019s work in this field in that very few people alive will ever have used one of Edidson\u2019s bulbs. We all will have used tungsten filament bulbs . (1910 William David Coolidge, an American physicist invents tungsten filament bulb) ",

            "answer_text": "The history of the incandescent electric light is complex. Historians Robert Friedel and Paul Israel list 23 inventors of incandescent lamps prior Thomas Edison. What Edison did, and the others did not was make it a commercially viable product. In fact his first patent application on the matter was titled \"Improvement In Electric Lights,\" clearly indicating he was aware of prior art on the topic. As for the question of how much he personally contributed vs his team, one of Edison\u2019s greatest inventions was the team approach to developing technology. ",
