            "answer_text": "Like pretty much everyone else, most of the time. There are various stereotypes of scientists that are very common in media: we\u2019re cold, aloof machines in human form, emotionally stunted nerds who are good at science but hopeless in any social situation, or arrogant madmen (this one is almost Always Male) who are willing to sacrifice all of humanity in our relentless quest for forbidden knowledge. Sometimes we\u2019re all three! It\u2019s bullshit, of course. We\u2019re people with an unusual and difficult job, and like everyone in that situation, sometimes we get frustrated with how hard it is to get our friends and families to understand the stresses of what we do for a living. But we do have friends and families, and we love them and enjoy spending time with them. We have the full range of human needs and desires, and for the most part we\u2019re no better and no worse than anyone else at meeting them. So if you want to know what \u201creal scientists\u201d are like: watch practically any TV or movie portrayal of scientists, and know we\u2019re not like that. ",
