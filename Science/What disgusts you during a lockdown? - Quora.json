            "answer_text": "It disgusts me to see that people aren't taking the pandemic seriously even after all these restrictions. Incident 1: My husband went to pick up some paracetamol tablets at the local pharmacy. The store in addition to selling medicine also sells general items. People are standing in the queue breaking the protocol of having to step out only in an emergency. They are wanting to buy gulab jamun mix and maggi noodles. I mean,why can't one survive without these petty things during the lockdown? Questioning these idiots will result in an awkward quarrel. Similarly, people have no qualms standing in long queues to pick up items like Gobi manchurian mix and party hats from supermarkets when there are some of us struggling to pick up essentials. Incident 2 Very clearly the PM spoke of social distancing while lighting candles today to fight corona. What did some idiots do? Used this as an opportunity to step out with candles and diyas in groups. Roamed the streets screaming their lungs out asking the virus to leave. And bursting crackers and clicking selfies. What disgusts me during the lockdown? That how the stupidity of all a few people is the deciding factor for the health of us. Not following social protocols when required and then spreading the virus to the rest of us. People need to understand that the lockdown is in place for our safety. It is not a vacation or an opportunity to form groups and roam the streets. I hope that they learn their lesson before the price is too heavy to pay. Stay safe! ",
