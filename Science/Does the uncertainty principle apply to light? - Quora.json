That makes its momentum maximally uncertain, though. \u201cOr does the uncertainty also include the uncertainty of the direction a photon is traveling at?\u201d You can not know which direction a photon takes until you measure it somewhere away from its point of origin because its momentum is a vector with an uncertain direction. You can make a pretty good guess depending on what you know about the emitter, but even laser beams diverge due to the basic uncertainty of the conservation of momentum involved in stimulated emission.

            "answer_text": "There is actually no entirely convincing answer to this question in standard relativistic Quantum Mechanics. In fact, one of the primary motivations for the transition to Quantum field theory is to avoid awkward followups to this questions. The uncertainty principle arises from the non-commutativity of the position and momentum operators (one generally doesn\u2019t consider velocities in QM). ( If you want you may define a velocity operator as simply [math]\\hat{v} = \\dfrac{\\hat{p}}{m}[/math] but this is not the velocity you know from Classical Mechanics) As others have pointed out, although the speed of the photon is known with certainty, it\u2019s momentum need not be. The states of definite momentum for a photon are just the states of definite energy since the momentum of a photon is given by [math]p = E/c[/math]. And it\u2019s cerainly possible for the photon to not be in a state of definite energy so you can definitely have uncertainty in the momentum of the photon. This is not an issue. The problem is that the position operator of a photon does not even qualify as a valid observable. There are several overlapping reasons for this. Actually position operators are a huge problem for relativistic quantum mechanics in general but these problems become really apparent in the case of photons. First of all, there is no notion of localisation of a photon because photons cannot be localized without being destroyed so you cannot naively define a position operator for a photon in the same way you define it for an electron (or any other massive particle) because such an operator would not even evolve in a causal manner (thereby violating special relativity). Actually this is the case for even massive particles at very small scales. A deeper reason stems from the fact that a photon has no rest frame with respect to which you can specify its position. Here is a paper that discusses some of these issues in a lot more depth. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens with the momentum operator, the uncertainty principle cannot apply to photons anyways because of the problems in relation to the position operator. And there is absolutely no way of resolving this in the context of relativistic Quantum Mechanics. If you want to understand the nature of photons, you have to go to Quantum Field theory, which elegantly resolves all these problems by completely abandoning the idea of localizing photons in space.

In the most obvious way, it applies to the uncertainty (noise) in the magnitude and the uncertainty (noise) in the phase of light. Decreasing the uncertainty of one at the expense of increasing the uncertainty of the other is called \u201csqueezing\u201d light. Squeezed coherent state - Wikipedia Also, in optical design, when you try to focus the light into a tight spot, there\u2019s an uncertainty trade-off between the spot size and the angles of the light rays approaching the spot. In addition, when light is emitted by an atomic transition, there\u2019s an uncertainty trade-off between the lifetime of the excited state and the energy of the photon. ",

The speed of light is indeed fixed at , but its momentum is just as free to vary as that of anything else.
