            "answer_text": "Contrary to what you might think, it is actually pretty rare for a scientist to name something after themselves. It\u2019s seen by other scientists as self-serving and arrogant. What usually happens is that a scientist discovers something new or invents a new method, and other scientists begin to associate that discovery with the original scientist. Interestingly enough, naming something after yourself is one way to score points in the Crackpot index. ",

Eventually it is often just called \u201cthe Jones method\u201d. At an international scientific meeting in 1988, my colleague John Philip announced that a hypothetical soil with particular physical properties that I had proposed and investigated should be officially known as the \u201cKnight soil\u201d. The name doesn\u2019t seem to have caught on. ",
