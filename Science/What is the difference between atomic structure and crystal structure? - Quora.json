            "answer_text": "Home Answer 7 Notifications Atomic structure referes to the nature of an atom. According to the model of Bohr (1913) electrons orbit around a nucleus of protons and neutrons.  This model is still useful but has its shortcomings. In the quantum mechanical model the nucleus is surrounded by a clould of electrons.  You may check-out Wikipedia for details Atomic orbital - Wikipedia Using high end aberration-corrected microscopes, you can \u201csee\u201d the atom as a sphere, but you cannot see the nucleus.  The crystal structure refers to the 3D arrangement of atoms, molecules or ions in a crystal. For example this is the crystal strucure of salt, NaCl  And this is the crystal structure of gold  Or one of several crystal structures of ice  ",

            "answer_text": "Atomic structure is what the atom is composed of: electrons, protons, neutrons. This includes how many of each particle there are, how many orbitals, etc. Crystal structure is the three dimensional structure a solid of any compound will form according to the electronic structures of the constituent atoms of the compound.
