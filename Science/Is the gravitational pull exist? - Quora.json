            "answer_text": "All of the scientific evidence suggests that Gravity is real, but it is a force that is experience due to the curvature of universe caused by objects with mass. We could do all of our calculations based on space-time curvature but Netwon\u2019s gravitational attraction is simpler to work with (and is correct enough for us to land people on the moon, and launch satellites). Newton\u2019s Gravitational model is in some ways similar to calculations of current etc in an electrical cable; we could do everything based on the electrical field strengths and the drift velocities of electrons, but working with Volt\u2019s Amp\u2019s and Ohm\u2019s are so much easier; they hide the complexity and they are good enough (it isn\u2019t an exact analogy I know but I think it explains what I mean).
