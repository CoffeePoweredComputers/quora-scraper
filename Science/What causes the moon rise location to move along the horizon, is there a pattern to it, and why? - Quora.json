            "answer_text": "A2A What causes moonrise location moving along the horizon and what the pattern is? I think you mean, \"Why does the moon rise further north sometimes and further south sometimes? What causes this seemingly seasonal, yet unpredictable change?\" Well, that's just the thing. It is seasonal, yet it is just as predictable as the next full moon. The effect is caused by several factors. The main thing is that we notice the effect simply because it is so pronounced. Not all of the factors are so pronounced as others, and some happen gradually over very great spans of time. Folks in the 12th century may have noticed slightly different effects than we do now, and your great-great-great grandchildren may see similar differences relative to current observations. Its kinda cool that you noticed, since most people don't, even though it's visible to all. It is rather gradual a change. We know all of this, simply because we've been watching the moon probably since the dawn of time. It's such an influence on our lives today that we have the lunar cycles on a lot of wall calendars, and many believe it causes emotional changes in us, particularly during a full moon. I don't know if that's really true or not. The tilt of the Earth and fluctuations in the tiltthe same thing that causes the seasons on Earth play a roll in the time of day or night when the moon rises, and how far north or south it first appears on the horizon as it rises each day.Weather Questions & Answers - what causes the seasons?What Causes Seasons?  - by timeanddate.com watch animations, or check the moon's predicted angle to the horizon at moonrise or moonset at any date, past, present, or future, from any location on Earth. This is the best link to show the \"pattern\" of this motion from day to day, since it shows a graphically represented version of the Earth with the day and night areas visible.The apparent change in the tilt of the inclination due to the tilt of the Earth, and the Earth's rotation around the sun is 18.3 to 28.6 degrees. This is probably what you have noticed the most.The inclination of the moon's orbit above the ecliptic planeAlthough not your question, this has meaning in my next statement, so I will include it here: The moon goes around the Earth in an orbit that takes 28.5 days and this causes the lunar phases to change. The moon has day and night just as the Earth has day and night, but it takes 28.5 days on the moon to go through one cycle.the moon's orbit around the Earth traces a roughly circular path, and you can think of it as a hoola hoop, that is tilted a bit off from flat around the equator.Moon Inclination animation of the lunar orbitThis inclination changes over very long periods of time. Right now it's a little over 5 degrees, and it's been that way for about the longest of any other change in it's orbit. This doesn't change very fast.The precession of the lunar nodesThe hoola hoop describing the lunar orbit does the same thing as your hoola hoop when you drop it on the ground, in a way. Just as your hoola hoop rolls around it's edge just before it falls completely flat on the ground. Except that the lunar orbit never falls flat, it just keeps doing that all the time. This wobble actually rolls backwards to the direction of rotation, and to the direction of it's orbit around the Earth. It takes about 18.6377 days less than a whole year to roll all the way around once. We don't notice it so much.Lunar precession - wikiChapter 3.2 - cycles of the moon, by King's University CollegeThe apparent change in the inclination of the Moon's orbitwhen you add up the Earth's tilt, the moon's orbital inclination, and account for the precession of the lunar nodes, you get a net change that runs on an up and down cycle bouncing along a repeating pattern like a ball bouncing across the room. There are lots of bounces and some are bigger than the others, but it never stops bouncing and the entire cycle of this repeating pattern of strange behavior takes about 18,000 years to complete.The wobble of the Earth's axisthe Earth is tilted at 23.4 degrees on it's axis and this doesn't change a whole lot, but it does go about 8 degrees either way of that on a regular cycle that lasts a really long time.one day, Vega will be the north star, instead of Polaris, as it is today.

            "answer_text": "What causes the moon rise location to move along the horizon, is there a pattern to it, and why? The location of moonrise and moonset change because the moon does not orbit exactly in the plane of Earth\u2019s equator. This is exactly the same reason that the Earth has seasons\u2026the orbit of the Earth around the sun is not exactly aligned with the Earth\u2019\u2019s equator. The pattern is precisely predictable, and varies on a yearly cycle. Also, because the moon orbits the Earth once per lunar month, there is a monthly progression of moonrise locations superimposed on the annual cycle. The Harvest Moon is the full moon nearest the Autumnal equinox. Because the moonrise\u2019s location is rapidly changing every day, the rise of the nearly full moon occurs near sunset for a few days in a row, instead of rising 50 minutes later each night. ",
