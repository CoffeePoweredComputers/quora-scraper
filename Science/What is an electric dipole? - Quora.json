            "answer_text": "An electric dipole consists of two charges of equal magnitude but opposite signs, separated by a small distance d. Let us also go ahead and find the magnitude and direction of the electric field at some point P \u201calong this dipole axis\u201d that is at a distance z from the dipole\u2019s midpoint. (Dipole moment on The Science Cube https://youtu.be/tHB0By6x6q4 )  We can see here that each charge would set up an electric field at point P independently. The +ve charge produces field E1 that points in +ve Z direction while the -ve charge sets up field E2 in the negative Z direction. Then we can write the net field at P as  And if we apply a little algebra here what we get is  Now in applied physics, what is usually of interest is to establish the electrical effect of dipole at distances that are significantly larger then the distance d or say z>>d. If we agree on this, what we find is that d/2z<<1 and therefore the square value would be even smaller and if we ignore this term then this equation changes to  And this product qd you see here is what combines the two intrinsic properties of a dipole that is charge q and separation d and is famously termed as the \u201celectric dipole moment\u201d of the dipole and is a vector quantity with |qd| being its value.

            "answer_text": " \u25cfAn electric dipole is a separation of positive and negative charges. The simplest example of this is a pair of electric charges of equal magnitude but opposite sign, separated by some (usually small) distance. A permanent electric dipole is called an electret. Dipoles can be characterized by their dipole moment, a vector quantity. For the simple electric dipole given above, the electric dipole moment points from the negative charge towards the positive charge, and has a magnitude equal to the strength of each charge times the separation between the charges. (To be precise: for the definition of the dipole moment, one should always consider the \"dipole limit\", where, for example, the distance of the generating charges should converge to 0 while simultaneously, the charge strength should diverge to infinity in such a way that the product remains a positive constant. \u25cf[math]Quantum[/math] [math]mechanical[/math] [math]dipole[/math] [math]operator[/math]:- Consider a collection of N particles with charges [math]q_i[/math] and position vectors[math] r_i[/math] For instance, this collection may be a molecule consisting of electrons, all with charge \u2212e, and nuclei with charge [math]eZ_i[/math] where[math] Z_i[/math] is the atomic number of the i\u2009th nucleus. The dipole observable (physical quantity) has the quantum mechanical dipole operator [math]{\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}=\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\,q_{i}\\,\\mathbf {r} _{i}\\,.}[/math] Notice that this definition is valid only for non-charged dipoles, i.e. total charge equal to zero. To a charged dipole we have the next equation: [math]{\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {p}}=\\sum _{i=1}^{N}\\,q_{i}\\,(\\mathbf {r} _{i}-\\mathbf {r} _{c})\\,.}[/math] where [math]{\\displaystyle \\mathbf {r} _{c}}[/math] is the center of mass of the molecule/group of particles.
