            "answer_text": "One of the best criticisms of Naturalism I have found is that Nature is just one category. If nature is just one category, then it appears that either (1) the power of nature is relative, so essentially any idea of nature might be valid, or (2) nature would accommodate a wide variety of phenomena, therefore there might be multiple types of energy, etc. or (3) there would be other worlds or aspects with unusual properties, that is, if local laws work within the category. This could be used as an argument for magical alternate realities, or rare forms of perception or magic powers. One can also argue that God\u2019s omnipotence is the only thing that would realistically guarantee standard physical laws in the determined sense. There is no determinism without a universal perspective. So, either we take universal perspective as a tautology, or determinism appears to be unnecessary. If we believe in God, on the other hand, God could create free will, so apparently determinism is an impossible argument unless we are arguing that life is intrinsically good (and therefore determined), which seems to contradict Naturalism. Another argument with a similar conclusion is that nature is not rational\u2014it does not obey human formalisms. There is nothing about a flaming ball of fire that is \u2018rational\u2019 per se. If it doesn\u2019t feel rational when it is touched, then it is not rational. The only thing rational \u2014 if it even is rational \u2014 is the human mind. Nothing else feels rational intrinsically. Essentially, rationality as we know it just happens to be our preferred fantasy. At different times in human history, madness and passion were equally important. And they are still important for many people today. Another possible argument a religious person would use, is that if rationality is not intrinsic to reality, then there is no rational limitation to explaining reality. If the passions are as important as rationality (say, psychologically), or if madness is sometimes a valid modality, then there must be ways (small ways, perhaps, but nonetheless), in which these modalitites reflect truths of nature much in the way that rationality reflects truths. Thus, perhaps, perhaps, if rationality leads to skepticism, then madness and the passions might lead to knowledge. Along with this is the argument of relative absoluteness, which says that, if how rational something is is only a matter of degree, we are not arguing that rationality as we know it is absolutely rational, so it is still possible that something we do not call rational is even more rational than what we know of rationality. That\u2019s my attempt for now. I think these are pretty strong arguments. I\u2019m starting to feel like Protagoras. ",

            "answer_text": "Alvin Plantinga's main argument against naturalism and similar arguments advanced by C. S. Lewis, Richard Taylor, J. P. Moreland, Victor Reppert, the argument from reason or evolutionary argument against naturalism, may be summarized as follows:Assuming naturalism, there is no source for belief-forming mechanisms other than evolution.Evolution selects for belief-forming mechanisms that produce beliefs that are useful for survival, not ones that are true.Given the conjunction of evolution and naturalism, there is no reason to think our belief-forming mechanisms are reliable.The belief-forming mechanisms that led us to accept evolution and naturalism are unreliable.Therefore, believing in both evolution and naturalism is self-defeating.Problems of the argument There is no reason to assume that there is little to no overlap between beliefs that are true and ones that are useful. For example, if you are standing in front of an apple tree full of edible apples, it would make sense that believing that the tree is full of apples is both useful and true.We are adapted to our immediate surroundings, so our beliefs about these surroundings will be more reliable than our beliefs about things on macro and micro scales, and theology for example. Our beliefs about that apple tree will be more reliable and understandable than, say, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and theology. Only a non-negligible part of our beliefs need to be true to the belief in evolution and naturalism in order not to be reciprocally self-destructive.Scientists have already been taking into account the implications of evolved cognitive biases. They can put checks on cognitive biases that may befall any individual person. Supernatural believers need to explain how the reliability of knowledge about the facts of the world can be established without experimental evidence.If our knowledge is dependent upon supernatural intervention, produces no reason to trust them. If it is the supernatural powers themselves that make us believe that they are trustworthy, why can't they deceive our trust? Religions claim that their various interpretations of God are consistent with divine evil, for unintelligible divine reasons. If so, a God is consistent with the divine evil of allowing people to be deceived by believing in false gods, for unintelligible divine purposes. If there\u2019s a criterion of truth then we want to know how it works and what further warrant it adds to the naturalist\u2019s practical test of making our way successfully in the world.Observations It is a proof of nonexistence or total obscure nonsense if the supernatural is said transcendent, \u201coutside\u201d space and time, and at same time omnipresent and immanent. The premise of the unintelligibility and unknowability of the supernatural is adopted simply to try to save the supernatural existence from contradictions and refutations. There is no way to identify the referent of the term supernatural, so the referent of supernatural remain undetermined or totally obscure nonsense. Some people refuse to allow that anything conceivably could occur which would count against their assertions and explanations about the supernatural, and consequently it is an idea which fits any supposed \u201cexplanations\u201d required of it. The supernatural is for where all the mysteries of the world are swept away. Whenever you do not know a cause, you will only have to say that the cause is supernatural and you will be fully cleared up. On what possible grounds can it be asserted that seemingly radically different supernatural concepts are, at bottom, the same concept? If there is a same concept, what it would take for an idea of supernatural not to share in that same concept? As supernaturals are imaginary, we really expect humans to invent thousands of what believers consider essentially different supernaturals. It is plain that the processes of belief formation through which the world\u2019s supernaturalist believers come to their various incompatible conclusions are very similar in their unreliability.The more likely we are to assume the magical thinking that a solution comes from inscrutable supernatural forces, the less likely we are to solve our problems ourselves. To faith, the important thing is the submission to the \u201csupernatural truth\u201d. However, a temple with a lightning rod shows a progress in distrusting the supernatural explanation. Religious faith mistake a failure of the imagination and experiment to find possible natural causes for an insight into necessity of the supernatural.The theist cannot fairly criticize the naturalist for being unable to say how something is possible, and then refuse to explain how God does it by miraculous power. It is better to have questions that cannot be answered than supposed answers that cannot be questioned. Naturalism rejects dogmatically imposed inquiry limits.What method can be used to determine the occurrence of a supernatural event? The hypothesis of God does not cause any deductive observation, nor does it even give any possibility of observation for verification. Scientific statements should be in conflict with possible observations. All supposed empirical evidence of supernatural phenomena boils down to gaps in our scientific knowledge, which believers are ready to fill with supposed supernatural causes. Naturalism is more suited than religion to explain the gradual expansion of scientific explanation and the gradual disappearance of supposed supernatural explanations. Scientific progress itself is strong empirical evidence against supernatural existence. If the new theory makes surprising predictions, then science is in progress.What criteria must be met for a concept of supernatural to be considered legitimate? Supposedly refuting naturalism doesn't establish the existence of any specific sort of non natural. If there are things outside human knowledge, this doesn\u2019t imply any realm outside the natural. If different people have opposed intuitions or faith about the supernatural, then the intuitions aor faith are unreliable. There is no reason at all to think that some group has a monopoly on the process that deliver truth about the supernatural and the universe. Intuitions or faith about the attributes of God or the supernatural are peculiar to certain cultures. Deep-seated intuitions of the past have since been discredited: A purely mechanical being cannot reason; space must be Euclidean; temporal succession cannot be relative. The ancient Egyptians also believed that they were right because their supernatural beliefs were thousands of years old.Some religions can do a supposed greater \u201cexplanatory\u201d simplicity with one supernatural entity to \u201cexplain\u201d everything, at the price of \u201cexplanatory\u201d obscurity. Religions can postulate one mysterious supernatural whose nature is incomprehensible and which possesses unique powers that it exercises in an unknowable way for purposes that we cannot understand. But the assumption in hidden supernatural powers can be the inversion of Occam's Razor too. Different people can believe in thousands of different supernatural entities. But we usually don't consider it is reasonable to believe thousands of various supernatural entities simply because there's no impartial empirical evidence. It is not reasonable for an individual to start believing that he has cancer because he doesn't have impartial proof. Science looks for theories or models that provide greater conceptual explanatory clarity and empirical direct or indirect potential verifiability. Those that worship diverse supernatural claim similar certainties of faith, so how can certainty of faith be a conclusive evidence? Why is the majority of the world not convinced by personal evidence, supposedly non-inferenced, of another faith or religion? Naturalism doesn't see how supposed non-physical causes can make a causal difference to the physical world.There is a distinction between having faith as trusting, or revering or loving or admiring, and having faith as belief that something is a fact. Having faith in God as trusting presupposes faith that God exists as a belief. To believe on the basis of faith suggests that there are two possible bases for a belief: either on the basis of reasons or on the basis of faith, that denotes the absence of argumentation. The relevant sense for unbelievers in a religious context is faith that something is a fact. Given the kind of beliefs that religion holds, for example, the belief that involves the source of a sacred text, a dependency of all reality on a cosmological existence of an entity with a variety of unique, unobservable properties, no personal experience without any support in the argumentation grounds religious belief.God by principle of conception isn\u2019t experienceable by faith. Experience could not tell you whether the object of experience is, for example, the creator of the universe, or omnipotent, or omniscient, or morally perfect. So religious experience cannot help to establish that God exists. God lacks any properties of identification that are perceivable, either directly or indirectly by instruments; as a consequence, the religious experience cannot have the content which religions can claim for it. We don't know how could be discovered a necessary inference between our finite sensations to the divine properties of the creator of the universe, omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. There are no grounds for saying that it is God who is being presented via our sensations. There is no independent evidence of any link from our emotional experiences to a reality independent of the mind and inscrutable.Shouldn't faith be questioned? The Christianity of the Inquisition, the Calvinists, and the Puritans is no different in practical effect from the Islam of Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia, the Taliban, and ISIS. How can true revelations be sorted out from false ones? There are no grounds at all for thinking that the supernatural does reveal himself to some and not to others. Unjustified beliefs threatens lives, livelihood, and social well-being: Bogus medicine kills people, opportunist religious authorities take our money and freedom. Religious faith can make people completely blind to the evidence against their views, making people more vulnerable to oppression, fraud, and abuse. Faith\u2019s morality resist free inquiry about their basic premises to accommodate social change, it is an obstacle to moral progress. Religious faith leads people to kill and die for it, without the need for further justification. It is gullibility with a halo of virtue, the denial of observation so that unearned moral authority can be preserved.",
