            "answer_text": "We need to understand the Reality of any object or subject in the universe by exploring them in 3 different avenues. These avenues are: Physical, Mental and Conscious avenues Let us understand this concept through the following analysis (this analysis just narrates about the fundamentals of 'understanding'): Year 0: Andrew had fallen in \u2018love\u2019 with Gloria at first sight itself. He couldn't think a life without her as she dominated his mind throughout \u201825\u2019 hours (\u2018shows\u2019 the impact) a day. Had got excited with his true \u2018love\u2019, Gloria also decided to give herself to Andrew by marrying him. Year 1: Andrew discovered Gloria was not up to the mark in satisfying his 'physical' demands that incuded sex as well. Year 2: Gloria had finally got convinced that Andrew didn't have adequate 'mental' potential to earn well for their life. Year 3: . Both of them became 'conscious' that the \u2018true\u2019 love was not existing between them at all. So they concluded that they were \u2018not\u2019 made for each other and decided to go for divorce. What went wrong? Even to choose a life partner, we need to evaluate them with all (i) physical (ii) mental and (iii) conscious ways. Physical way: This is the way through which we can 'sense', 'intrude' and 'measure' any 'tangible' object. Mental way: This way would help us understand the potential of others through 'logical' and 'reasoning' analysis. Unfortunately, we won't be able to 'measure' such potential but we can only analyse mentally. Conscious way: This is all about feeling the 'feelings'. Love or Happiness or Happiness or Harmony or Attachment or Aspiration or Relationship (all core areas of our life) are all in the forms of 'feelings'. We can neither 'measure' nor \u2018analyze\u2019 them. We can only 'feel' them. As long as we use only the 'physical' way to understand any object or subject, we won't be able to understand the whole Reality behind them (Refer \u2018Year 0\u2019 above). When we limit our exploration only with physical \u2018examination\u2019 and 'measurement' , once again, we can't understand the Reality (Please refer 'Year 1\u2032 above). We need to device a method to explore any object or subject beyond physical \u2018examination\u2019 and \u2018measurement\u2019 by including 'mental' as well as 'conscious' ways. Unfortunately, science, currently, is limiting it's approach only up to 'physical' way of exploration only. It completely depends on the results evolving through physical 'measurements' only. When approximately 95% of the universe is intangible and remains 'immeasurable' as well as 'unmeasurable' for us, how can the current approach of science (total dependency on physical measurements only) fully describe the Reality? Reference: In the Dark: 95 Percent of the Universe Remains Unexplained Imagine a situation of our home in which we are able to \u2018see' and 'interact' with only 5% of the objects and subjects existing within. Remaining 95% of our home, does contain 'invisible', 'intangible' and 'unmeasurable' entities which are to be uncovered and understood, in order to understand the whole Reality surrounding us. Unfortunately, we are currently surviving in such an ignorant situation only. Only when we truly understand the nature of all objects and subjects existing throughout universe, science would be able explain us the Reality. Unfortunately, we can't even make \u2018future\u2019 Andrews and Glorias \u2019measure\u2019 the extent of their mutual love (\u201cWow\u2026Andrew has got 96.567473 lovedale units of love for me today. It is improved from last week's value. Awesome\") as the parameter of love itself seems to have comprised by unmeasurable particles which are not the \u2018matter\u2019 known and measured by science.

            "answer_text": "As things stands the scientific approach generally tends towards metaphysical reductionism (a metaphysical commitment to reductionist ontology, epistemology, and methodology) and as a result fails to appreciate the role of structure in reality. Any such descriptions are necessarily lacking in accuracy and precision. This is more of a problem in physics and less of a problem in biology. Reality is clearly a combination of substance and structure. The universe is made of some kind of stuff, but that stuff is made into many different kinds of complex objects. These complex objects are characterised by a specific arrangement of parts (structure) and relatively insensitive to swapping out of identical parts. Complex objects persist over time, have specific properties not found in their parts, and may cause events and processes in ways that their parts cannot. So by any useful definition of \u201creal\u201d, structure is real. A dynamic structure is a system. But reductionism destroys structure and disregards it. The biologist can only learn so much from dissecting the organism they study and even less by rendering it down to its elements. Biologists must observe the living organism interacting with its environment and see systems within systems. Reductionists typically see a complete description of reality as being expressible in a single mathematical expression. All theories reduce to a single fundamental theory. This is one of the most deleterious philosophical consequences of metaphysical reductionism. We have to keep in mind, for example, that as accurate as the Schrodinger equation is, it cannot be solved, even in principle, for the deuterium atom. Rather, as it is applied to anything more complex than a hydrogen atom, physicists introduce simplifying assumptions into their work that force the description to depart from reality further and further as they encounter more complexity. Indeed the reality implied by the Schrodinger equation is still a major mystery with at least a dozen major competing theories for how it relates to reality. Reductionism fails on its own terms! Now reductionists methods are useful for establishing what substances exist and what we can know about them, but they tell us nothing at all about structures of systems. It is not a matter of abandoning reductionism per se, only the metaphysics of reductionism that erroneously insists that only substances are real. We have to recognise that different methods are used to gain knowledge of structures and systems, and to infer their existence. When science embraces structure antireductionism along with substance reductionism then it might be possible to describe our reality to a much higher degree of accuracy and precision. But this also entails different descriptions for different layers of complexity because of the emergent properties of complex objects. A full description of reality will look much like science already does - a pluralistic system of knowledge with overlapping and interacting parts. ",

As humans, we have many ways to express and describe reality, including literature, visual arts, dance, and music. When I think of music, or visual arts, it is very often its non-repeatability that makes it interesting and delightful. ",

There\u2019s pretty much about the observable universe that we do not yet understand, but science is an \u201caccretive\u201d process and work continues. I don\u2019t doubt that things like \u201cdark matter\u201d and \u201cdark energy\u201d will eventually yield their secrets. It took many years from hypothesizing about the Higgs Boson until it was actually observed, and required the building of the huge CERN supercollider to do it. Those who are \u201cspiritually\u201d inclined will say that science cannot explain a wide variety of their favored phenomena, but science deals with the observable and the testable\u2026. And most of these spiritual matters are neither. What science can deduce is the mental processes that allow belief in such things. There is already ongoing research in this regard. ",
