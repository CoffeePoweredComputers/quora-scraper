            "answer_text": "Assuming the sample is a isotropic liquid solution, the majority of proton-proton coupling will be due to indirect coupling, or J-coupling. When two atoms are bonded, they share electrons to reach an overall lower energy eigenstate. If the nuclei have non-zero spin, then they will be hyperfine coupled to the electrons. Its also important to keep in mind that the nuclei will be hyperfined coupled to each-other, however since we are assuming they are in an isotropic liquid where the molecules are free to move, this portion of the coupling will be averaged to zero. A simple way to visualize it is image a molecule arranged in a line proton1-electron-proton2, if proton1 is polarized, its hyperfine interaction with the electron will allow it to transfer a portion of its polarization to the electron. This electron now, will affect the local magnetic field experienced by proton2, causing the behavior and energy levels of proton 2 to be modified. Of course this coupling operates in reverse, and from this idea the J-coupling can be derived. Some good resources are 5.3 Spin-Spin Splitting: and the ever helpful Wikipedia J-coupling  Cheers ",
