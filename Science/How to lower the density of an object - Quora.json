            "answer_text": "I deem Mr. Berger\u2019s answer as the most reliable of all four answers provided, even though the other three are credible as well. I am taking it that you are inquiring about changing the density of an object (lowering it) without what is known in science as \u201cDOPING\u201d. For instance, most alloys have a lower density than the densest metal in the alloy. Copper introduced into gold, reducing its karat purity, effectively reduces the density of the gold as well. But I believe that this is not the spirit of your question. If I am wrong, please do not read further. If I am right, please continue: (1) Reducing the temp of a fixed mass of water to below 277 K, results in reducing the density of water. Density of water at 277 K, by definition is 1,000.000 kg/m^3. Lowering the temp will DECREASE the density, because water has the very ODD property of volume increasing upon cooling below 277 K. (2) Heating a rod of steel DECREASES the density of steel that makes up the rod. This is because, as Mr. Berger explains, the rod will expand in length (see Coefficient of Linear Expansion) and effectively, its volume will increase. The MASS of the rod remains constant. Then, automatically, the Density of steel is measured to be LESS. (3) All IDEAL GASSES, have the same volume at STP. A kilo-mole of an ideal gas at STP has a volume of 22,400 liters = 22.4 m^3. We can determine the Density of an ideal gas (or near-ideal gasses) by simply dividing their kilo-mole-mass by 22.4 m^3. An example; Methane: the kilo-mole-mass of methane is 16 kg per kilo-mole. The density would be 16/22.4 = 0.71 kg/m^3. Let\u2019s increase the temp of methane from ST and keep the pressure (P) constant. The VOLUME will increase proportionally following the Gas-Law, which is Charles' Law in this case. So the volume increases, the density decreases. At 546 K, the volume would be DOUBLE of what it was at STP. Then the DENSITY would be 0.355 kg/m^3. ",

            "answer_text": "That's a very good question. Density is mass/volume. So you could either increase the volume or decrease your mass. Something that comes to mind would be a basketball. When you inflate it all the way, the volume is more or less fixed. However, you can continue to add air and increase the pressure of the ball, effectively increasing the overall mass inside that fixed volume. Similarly, by letting that air out, assuming the ball remains inflated, you begin to decreases the density of the ball. This is very difficult to do with liquid, as most liquid is relatively incompressible. Ignoring changing the molecules or reacting the liquid. Also, there are exceptional examples of adding two liquids together to result in a decreased overall volume but that's extremely unusual. Solids could take on different forms: Heterogeneous materials like sponges, where the overall exterior volume would basically remain the same but the water inside could evaporate. So your mass is decreasing as the water evaporates but the sponges volume isnt changing (much). Homogenous materials that are compressible, like styrofoam, wood, paper or plastic polymers. With these the volume would be changing, not the overall mass. And incompressible solids like diamonds. For all practical purposes, you won't be able to change the volume or mass of a diamond. There may be some gasseous diffusion possible with hydrogen, but that would be more analogous to the sponge and water example. ",
