            "answer_text": "You know that in structure of CO there are 3 covalent bonds, Out of which 2 are sigma bonds and 1 pi bonds. So there is a trick that no. of sigma bonds determines its hybridisation. So, 2\u2248sp hybridisation And thus linear structure. Hope this helps. Thanks for A2A Strangest road ",
