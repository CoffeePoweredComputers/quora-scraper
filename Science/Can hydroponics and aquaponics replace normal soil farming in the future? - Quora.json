            "answer_text": "It won\u2019t, though hydroponics and aquaponics can be practiced on large areas but when it comes to economics, it is best suitable for urban people who have less space and need more productivity rather than soil farming on large areas. Lets take an example where you want to grow tomatoes in one fertile acre of land, by soil farming we can grow about 10,000 - 15,000 plants. We just need to water the plants everyday from our bore water supply or other means and do nothing, a fertile land can also give yields ( tomato family ) which are just 60 - 50% that of hydroponics. Where should we use hydroponics:-1. Hard to grow varieties which require extreme soil conditioning and precise nutrients.2. Very dry climatic conditions and extreme water scarcity.3. Seriously affected climatic conditions which cause blight and other problems to plants. Aquaculture induced rice farming is already under practice for the production of rice in China, Indonesia and many other countries, we can also see this type of farming in many parts of Andhra Pradesh as well. India is blessed with fertile soils but the ignorant farmers and pesticide companies are killing its fertility and turning them down to barren lands. Everyone should help or atleast make a contribution towards making the barren lands back to fertile by so many available organic farming methods and reduce the use of fertilisers and abolish the use of chemical pesticides. Not all vegetables give exceptional results in hydroponics and aquaponics, you cannot grow a cactus in a pond nor a lotus in a desert, green leafy vegetables mainly light feeders can be grown in hydroponics and takes very less time, Solanaecea family ( tomatoes, peppers, chillies, potatoes ) gives good results.

            "answer_text": "It depends on how long into the future. Right now using these two methods not all vegetables can be grown. And most vegetables haven\u2019t been grown using these two methods yet. Even pulses and grains haven\u2019t been tested. So unless tests are conducted soon there is no sure way to know. Just to add a little more info on these two methods. They solve a real problem in places where land is not available. But in the case of India we have abundance of land so it does not really solve any problem here. And the plants grown using these two techniques are not in the Indian diet for example swiss chard, bak choi, cherry tomatoes etc. So specifically in the next 5\u20137 years i do not think they will replace normal soil farming.
