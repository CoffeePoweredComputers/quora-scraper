            "answer_text": "In this century, You've food, clothes and with shelter you've a smartphone or Laptop/Computer. That is why you're asking this question on Quora. Otherwise it's impossible. Why you're using laptop and smartphone if you're able to fulfill your fundamental needs ? Because you want to explore and upgrade. And if a cosmologist and an Astrophysicist is trying to find some answers of unraveled questions then he is not doing this for himself. It is his journey and joy that he wants to share with you. What will happen because of this? You'll realise that there is something beyond your reach and something which you can never control. Black Hole is not just a topic anymore. It's way beyond than this. Because of Black-hole study we're able to understand the spatial entity of time. We are developing our understanding about the Gravity and entropy. Sometimes you have to do something, not for money and fame, not for obsession and determination, not even for the recognition\u2026. YOU NEED TO DO THIS FOR THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYSTEMS IN WHICH YOU'RE LIVING RIGHT NOW. ",

Learning about black holes, given there\u2019s one in every galaxy, therefore, is part of that. :D And, as we learn how the universe works, we also find things of more short term use\u2026 such as Tang, and, quantum computing, etc. :D ",
