            "answer_text": "There are zero neutral news organizations that I am aware of. I mostly watch Fox News, ,and yes most conservatives agree that Fox is slanted conservative (while liberals never admit that CNN and MSNBC are liberal). However, the main difference between Fox being slanted conservative and most other news outlets being slanted liberal, is that Fox at least reports on almost ALL current news events. The more Liberal news networks don\u2019t even report on a story at all if it doesn\u2019t fit their liberal ideology. There are exceptions obviously, but this holds true as a general rule in my opinion. So, if you watch those liberal networks, you are probably not getting all the news, regardless of how it is being delivered. I want to know all the news, and then I will decide on what the real truth is, versus not being told all the news, because that news organization is afraid it may make their side look bad. ",

            "answer_text": "I find it odd that anyone would want to watch a news channel that is slanted in its bias in any case and I\u2019m not just talking about the right/left divide either. The answer is predictably any news organisation that has a mandate not to be biased and/or regulated by an independent body. I wouldn\u2019t touch any American news organisations with a barge pole as they are all pretty much slanted to appeal to a specific ideological audience and that\u2019s not how I like the truth being told. Fox News probably couldn\u2019t tell you where Madrid is; its international news is so shoddy and unprofessional - it might as well not even bother.CNN - The international syndicated channel is alright but I cannot stand their editorial standards and whiny politics.MSNBC - Always appears a bit childish to me. Like a kids programme pretending to be newsThe BBC is the one I keep up to date with for international news outside of the UK except for news regarding the Indian subcontinent. Also ITV news tends to be politically less biased when it comes to Brexit and the Independent is the least biased when it comes to domestic affairs outside of the political sphere. Basically, if the media outlet isn\u2019t invested in the politics or a particular story, you\u2019re going to get less partisan content. Always best to mix and match and keep away from your own bubble. ",
